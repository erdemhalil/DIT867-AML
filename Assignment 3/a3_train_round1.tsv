1	I wanted the Pfizer vaccine, it was my first choice and I’m so glad I was able to get it. I get my second shot in a few weeks. I’m also thankful to the scientists, and all those helped with development, research, and with production of this (and other) vaccine... Especially the research participants!
0	LMAO! I already got banned from two communities because I said the so called “COVID vaccine” will kill people.
1	There's enough COVID running around out there and enough risk of long COVID that I got the shot as soon as I could.
0	Any other drug that caused this much widespread damage would have been pulled off the shelves a long time ago!
0	This documentary sickened me to my core. And further convinced me that I would never take it. Well done to Nazarin for standing
1	I know some people are worried about long-term effects of the vaccine, but rest assured that scientists are closely monitoring safety data
1	The reason 80,000 Americans died from flu is the absolute stupidity of the 63% that refused the vaccine. You cannot blame the stock market to NOT melt down over stupidity. The situation is very different for #Covid-19 because there is no vaccine. Your tweets are dangerous.
0	The risk of any medical intervention should always be voluntary.  Never should we mandate anything like this.
1	now a days people started get vaccinated
0	My husband was forced to take the shots to keep his heart Dr. appt at VA Hospital. After his first shot, I came home to find him passed out on the floor. It took about 30 minutes to get him to come out of it. He has incessant headaches, and dizzy spells. 1 year later VA runs MRI and then MRE on his hear. VA says his brain vessels are full of small clots. And he is never feeling well anymore. VA has it on his record that it is a side effect from shots. My doctor told me what was in it and would not take it. I did not either. At least I am here to take care of my husband.
1	I've had 2 covid vaccines, and I've been suffering from more infections and ill health than my previous record of 15 years with only 2 - 3 days off work due to sickness.
1	4 shots and hoping for more ...................... still going strong
0	Thank God I never had any vaccines never will
1	This does MEAN that vaccines have BENEFITES .
0	I can totally relate to the crying.  For days I have been doing a good bit of that.  At first people insinuated it was psychological even though I've never been an anti-vaxxer.  I willingly lined up to take it.  But now that my husband had a bout of it also, but very briefly after 2nd dose, he believes me.  I just can't understand why this isn't being covered.  Some days I can barely function and it seems like it's that way for you too.  Even though I have exercise induced asthma when I exercise outdoors during the cold, I'm healthy.  I go for my wellness exam, mammogram, dermatologist, and ophthalmologist each year and rarely have to go for visits other than those.  My doctor told me she wishes all her patients were like me.  She told me she's had several patients who are calling with these symptoms also.  I just hope and pray for you and all the others that these side effects disappear and we can get back to normal.  Honestly, I wish I had not taken it at all.  But with the pressure for vaccine passports to be able to travel and just to go to store mounting, I took it as well as the 2nd although I'm not sure why, if someone is vaccinated, they care if I am or not.  This is a very scary time as we all have to deal with this and the side effects and just the lack of acknowledgement from the vaccine companies and CDC as to how to deal with them
0	Some people prefer to take a proven, effective, Nobel-prize-winning prophylaxis and treatment drug instead of an unapproved, experimental vaccine.
1	Honest to God, folks: Please help us out. Wear a mask, social distance and please stop believing lies. COVID is REAL, and we TRULY ARE EXHAUSTED.
1	I chose to get vaccinated with the COVID vaccine because by doing so I feel better to protect my family, to protect my co-workers and myself. When I got it, I felt a little sore in my arm, a little tired, but that was it. Now I feel secure and protected.
1	Vaccination is a way to contribute to the greater good and protect the vulnerable.
1	From a scientific and potential public health standpoint, this is an extraordinarily important advance.
0	You left out the part where the VAXXINE gives you blood clots and injures your heart
0	If they're so confident the vaccines are safe, then they should be subject to liability. They won't be until 2024, under the Emergency Use Authorization designation
0	Never regretted not getting that shot.
1	I'm signed up for this trial in the US. I'm just waiting for the call to come down and get the shot. I'm excited that the UK trail is resuming and hope it resumes here in the States soon  too. It pays $150/visit. With 2 shots a month apart. Then follow ups for blood work for the next 2 years.2 out of 3 will get the vaccine and the 3rd will get a placebo.
0	Vaccines cause autism! Wake up, people!
1	In other words, perfectly safe.
1	Achievement unlocked- 2nd COVID vaccine shot got!  #covidvacccine #moderna #seconddose
0	The speed of vaccine development concerns me. Feels rushed
1	Thanks to the COVID-19 vaccine, we can envision a return to normalcy. It's a testament to human innovation and the tireless efforts of healthcare professionals worldwide.
0	A toll for race and class domination !
0	Oh. We’re supposed to listen to him cause he’s a doctor. Who knows “science”. Right. Not vaxxed and never will be.
1	After researching and understanding the science behind mRNA vaccines, I'm impressed by the innovation and safety profile of these vaccines. This technology has the potential to revolutionize medicine.
1	COVID Vaccination, although imperfect, provides a much more standard level of protection” without risking serious disease
1	Wife and I just got our 3rd boosters yesterday and we can’t say we’ve missed the sore arms, lethargy, and headaches that come afterwards…But it’s always better to be safe than sorry. Get the new booster folks, before you travel for the holidays
0	I’ll happily take a vaccine (I just got my flu shot like I do every year), but not this early.  Takes like 4 years to produce a safe vaccine (and that’s the fastest ever).  I don’t think rushing it is a good idea.
1	The resulting efficacy of the vaccines are about 93%
0	I am so relieved I did not take it and neither did my husband or kids. I can sleep at night knowing that poison is not in us. It disgusts me that people who hang onto ignorance because they are scared it's in them can't look around at all the people speaking out. All the young people who collapsed and died is heart breaking
0	These vaccines were developed too quickly; we don't know the long-term consequences.
0	My heart bleeds for all the people who took the jab. Because they were frightened scared or coerced into it. That they would loose their jobs homes unable to feed their children. It's not right to say I told u so etc. These people trusted and believed what they were told. They are the innocents. Gov etc are evil. And I hope their is justice for the people injured and lost their lives. May their souls rest in peace
0	I just had to come back to this now that we know the "vaccine hesitant" people were 100% right.
1	Teacher's commitment to health, vaccinated to protect students and families.
0	The above article...sponsored by Pfizer.
0	Someone who was perfectly healthy then had 3 heart attacks and other symptoms . It is perfectly reasonable to assume it might be a vaccine injury
0	the so called “COVID vaccine” will kill people.
1	The best moments of my life in 2021 were the few seconds when I got vaccinated, because I value my life.
1	I was a vaccine guinea pig and proud to have done my small part by joining a trial. Would do it again so others can benefit from more vaccines
0	Vaccines are poison
1	I never knew that not wanting to put unknown things in your body and being scared to get it cause you might get something, wasn't a good reason not to get it. Wow lol
0	"We must not forget this dark part of human history so that another health dictatorship like that of 2020 does not happen again."
0	They look pretty smart now.  Vaccine has significant side effects and excess mortality is up.
0	I am unvaccinated and don't have any regrets.
0	Boycott the jab
1	“Giving facts to the ignorant is like giving medicine to the dead” - Primal
1	90% is MASSIVE! That is a lot higher than early estimates and above what Fauci said we needed which was 55-60%. If the side effects are minimal if at all then we have something to finally be happy about it with this fucking virus
1	My father – who I'm sure is rolling over in his grave right now – got a double degree in history & biology. He worked at the State Health Department of Alabama on the first measles campaign  (against the deadly Rubeola, not the milder Rubella that the majority of children – myself included – contracted, along with mumps & chickenpox, usually before we entered before first grade) in the early 1970's.  He & his colleagues would go around poor neighborhoods, knocking on doors & educating parents on the benefits of the vaccine & the dangers of what might happen if they didn't come to the local health department & get their children vaccinated.  My father also came to schools – mine included - & administered the shots to the children, including me. I was so proud of him, proud to be his daughter.  What the hell has happened to those days when people respected science & the scientifically educated people trying to help them?
0	PUREBLOODs rule!!
0	I personally know of four that died after their first jab.  Two others now have rare cancers after their jabs.   Must be climate change!
0	Glad I didn't take it! Hallelujah
1	I got vaccinated and it made me feel free. I could all of a sudden start to imagine that I was going to get to hug my grandkids, that I could travel again, that I could go visit with friends and do things I haven't done for a year and a half. It made me feel free and I have the hope of freedom to come.
0	Not all checks. Usually they test a drug for up to tens years to make sure it has no long term issues but y’all go ahead and beta this drug
1	I’m sorry. That you lost someone so dear to something we should’ve kept in check and collectively taken seriously. And that you work with callous shitheads like that. If there’s one thing COVID’s made me realize, it’s that some people just haven’t lost enough people to understand the value of life.
1	I'm an Icu nurse and we still have alot of patients like Christopher. It seems like they are getting younger now and they end up dying. When did vaccine get to be a dirty word? I have seen a few people who were vaccinated end up on a ventilator but most are the unvaccinated.  I think a life is more important than arguing about the vaccine. I  have seen rare adverse reactions to the flu shot, like guillane barret,but nothing from the covid vaccine, that I am aware of anyway.
1	To get "natural immunity" one must be infected. Which introduces the first order risk that occurs when someone who has no immunity is infected. Do you think that allowing an uncontrolled spread of smallpox would be an appropriate policy to immunize a population to smallpox?
0	If your doctor is still pushing the Covid vaccine and believes it's safe and effective, then he/she is a quack who cannot think critically. Fire them !
1	It's just that BigPharma truly is scummy and alway$ has been....We All accept and know  this  here,AND yet  WE are gullible and   dumb enough to  think that they are 'good" or  virtuous when making vaccinations........ 300,000 avoidable deadly hospital medical errors a year in the US AND we still OBEY those  reckless and greedy MD's  .......HMMMM...How stupid is that?
0	Now I know why they were offering free burgers and fries if you get your shot. What about the millions of doses they send to other countries for free
0	Who would ever believe the fda?
1	Vaccines really do work
1	With natural immunity the downside is always that you have to risk the possible bad outcomes of getting the disease itself first.
1	Got my pfizer vaccine today. Feeling good, just a little bit tired. Looking forward to putting COVID behind us.
0	You're hilarious if you think I'm taking even 1 single vaccine
1	I admire the scientists and healthcare workers who worked tirelessly to develop and distribute these life-saving vaccines.
0	Just get Covid like a real man/woman
1	i got the pfizer vaccine and i’m fully vaccinated.
0	The amount of relief I feel that I didn't get vaccinated, even though I was pressured by almost every member of my family, is absolutely indescribable! I feel sorry for those who got it though. Best of luck, they're definitely gonna need it.
1	I have had COVID 4 times and it was terrible. I like to think those vaccines helped me. You have no idea what your saying. Was the virus man made? Maybe... but it was real and I'm alive thanks to those vaccines
1	Vaccines get the job done at least.
0	I'm not sure I trust the COVID-19 vaccine. It was developed so quickly, and I'm not sure about the long-term effects.
0	I had an allergic reaction to the JJ vaccine.
1	The more people vaccinated the closer we get to hugging our loved ones without worry.
1	They started talking about 5g, nanobots, population control, something something
0	This vaccine is new and no one knows what side effects this will cause.
0	Regarding the so-called vaccine. I'm unvaccinated, but may need to get it as it is still a requirement for getting a green card. I managed to avoid it till now, and have been stuck inside the US since the mandate, because while it was not required for entry to the US for US citizens/green card holders, as a Visa holder I was apparently a rodent that had to get it if I were to leave the US and try to enter it again. I was not able to visit my 80+ year old parents for 3 years. It may all have been for nothing as it seems they are not lifting it to get a green card.
0	Vaccine mandates are causing unnecessary division in society.
1	I'm 62 and fully vaccinated no fear here.
1	If a vaccine gets FDA approval, that means the scientific consensus is the benefits outweigh the risks. Why would anyone think that they are qualified to make that decision better than the entire system we have in place? How often has the system failed us? I'd be the first in line as soon as a vaccine is recommended for the general population. For those with allergies: as with any other vaccine, there will be a long list of screening questions to make sure you don't get exposed to an allergen.
0	vaccine ingredients are toxic – injecting poison into your body is never a good idea.
0	I didnt get it because 1. I didnt want to. 2. Im confident in my immune system's ability to overcome virus. 3. Im confident in God's plan for my life. 4. I didn't like the way the media and the government was FORCING it upon ppl and fear mongering, it seemed evil. 5. Only 2% or less of ppl die from covid, IT AINT THAT SERIOUS! . It was statistically insignificant. 6. There was no clear story or research or understanding of the illness or the shot. A bunch of back and forth. 7. If the illness itself was new, how could the vaccine have been developed properly?? I could go on, but ill stop.
1	*When the vaccine takes your kids life*  I win!
1	Vaccines save millions of lives every year by preventing deadly diseases.
1	Mederma are the ones who made the vaccines . Did you not hear news other day about a Cancer vaccine? This is how my mind works since Covid. Call me a silly conspiracy theorist, I don’t care .
1	The jabs, it's not a vaccine, prevent the worst affects of the virus. It does not stop you catching or transmitting the virus, but it may mean you don't die. That's why I had them.
0	My mother died from a heart attack a few months ago after she took the vaccine. She’s never had cardiovascular problems in her life
1	Stop any hate and punish haters, this virus speed is more than Covid 19 ... ohh sorry I forgot I am in zombi-land, so try to hide bro it’s already spread across the .....even police &; court so who will punish ?? ,and wait for vaccine
0	I've come across various studies suggesting potential side effects of the vaccines. This inconsistency in information has made me cautious about getting vaccinated.
0	These are real people, with real stories, whose lives have been destroyed by the Covid-19 vaccine. 20 million dead, over 2 billion injured. The vaccine kills. #vaccineDead #vaccineGenocide #vaccineInjuries
0	The deadliest medicine in western medicine history!
0	It's almost as if these huge multinational corporations don't always have our best interests at heart. I'm shocked.
0	We the people that refused the shot have no side effects.
0	In the US many government agencies as well as Congress were deemed exempt from any vaccine mandate. Did the UK government gift themselves the same exception?
0	If you still can't bring yourself in 2024 to admit that health authorities, governments, and pharma researchers lied to you about the COVID vaccines then you're a lost cause.  I can't believe this is still an open conversation for anybody anymore.
0	It’s a complete mystery, brought to you by Pfizer.
1	Extremely heart wrenching stories but I do hope she makes it through for her son <3 everyone PLEASE get vaccinated and wear a mask!
0	I've never been vaccinated, and I've never gotten COVID. I have a Doctor who was vaccinated several times, and she got COVID twice... I also have a friend who never had a health problem in his life, and less than 2 weeks after getting the vaccine he was hospitalized with swollen lymph nodes around his heart (which constricted his breathing). He now has Hypoglycemia, Graves Disease, and anemia. I'm not sure if it was the vaccine, but it all happened immediately after
0	If something is so great and actually works, you wouldn't need to be paid so much to bombard us with non stop propaganda and constant ads.
0	In November of 2021, a team of scientists in the Department of Pediatrics at Seattle Children’s Hospital, which is affiliated with the University of Washington, published a study in the journal Pediatrics that showed a definitive link between mRNA vaccines and heart problems in adolescents, research which has since been confirmed by over half a dozen other studies and case reports.
1	a headache and being sore is way less worse that having the covid :)
0	Those people showed me why there are people hunting Nazis after 80 years. Those jab pushers are absolutely ruthless going as far as trying to jab kids without parents' knowledge
1	They are only showing the ones who didn't want it. I got vaccinated and my daughter. There were many Americans who did get vaccinated and who wanted it. It was about half and half. I hope you get your vaccine. I am hoping everyone who wants ine gets one. Many Americans here are wanting everyone in the world who want the vaccine to get it. Please, trust me there are a lot of people who care about everyone else around the world ... and you personally. We send our love and high hopes for your good health
0	I have covid right now and I was never vaccinated.  Had a fever for the first two days but now I'm fine.  My mom got the vaccine and booster (she has covid too) and shes a lot worse than me
0	Well even the newest Covid vaccines are only 54% effective at preventing symptomatic infection in adults And that is from the CDC So the idea that you aren’t going to get Covid if u have these vaccines is now laughable.
0	Iv got a family member who’s fighting for her life because of this vaccine! Anyone pushing this poison can go to hell
0	So relieved that I didn’t crumble, I remained strong and do not have that poison in my body !!
0	And the NPCs will still say it was worth the risk.
0	Vaccines—easiest and sneakiest way to depopulate the planet and get rich doing it.
0	DO NOT COMPLY!
0	Guys I wanna join but I do not want the vaccine . What do I do? Do I wait for a mandate to be lifted how long will that take I’m eager to go I’m ready I’m 18 and I’m committed . I just don’t think I want to join if I must get this shot. It’s been my dream to go but what a conundrum I’m in. Suggestions, thoughts ,help and personal anecdotes are appreciated.
1	"I got vaccinated.  Do it for your own good, your loved ones, and 'society'."
1	misleading those videos are. Like is anti vax normal now?
1	Q: Is the covid vaccination really a good thing?  A: Yes! Billions of lives are being saved! If we didn't vaccinate then we can use the example of the 1918 Flu (which is remarkably similar to the Covid-19 Pandemic) to calculate that within two more years we would have seen a total of 2.5 Billion deaths, so yes the vaccines are protecting our civilization just like we intended the vaccines to do
1	If you're older and/or have comorbidities. You should get the vaccine. If you've already had covid 19 and have recovered. Then natural immunity may be all you need. Israel study shows recovered covid patients are just as protected as the vaccinated. It's a personal decision that you will need to make.
1	I think vacations should be mandatory, who else agrees
0	the vaccine was brought forward too quickly
0	Take all 3 boosters if your so sure it's safe and upload a daily vlog!
1	Seeing the decline in COVID-19 cases as vaccine distribution increases gives me so much hope for the near future.
1	you don't lose the antibodies that quickly after being vaccinated. The immune response after second shot of Pfizer or moderna is much stronger and longer lasting than for natural infection.  The vaccine leaves you with with memory B cells and T cells which can quickly spur your body to manufacture antibodies once the virus is detected. These cells stick around for several years!
1	Maybe you’d feel more comfortable getting the novavax this time as it’s based on more “traditional” vaccines technology and not mRNA? Bonus that it gave me zero side effects when I tried it this year.
0	When the truth comes out, you can’t unvaccinate yourself.
0	It’s so safe they need to promote it 24/7🤣🤣
0	3 things I still can't get today: 1. covid vaccine 2. PS5 3. RTX 3090
1	Good on you. In Canada we have one of the largest producers of vaccines and our collective governments did not contract them to develop a Covid vaccine, Now we are begging about trying to get vaccines. Hoping India has some spare for us.
0	I don’t trust the covid 19 vaccines!! They are just useless!
1	Let's keep it real: vaccines are the backbone of public health, keeping us all in the game. Time to roll up those sleeves.
0	I'm waiting for more long-term data before deciding on vaccination.
0	I got sick as well had a reaction to it. I only had 1 shot. My doctor said no second one. I dont even want another one. I only took that one because of job forsement . This is not at all fair just to work. But i wont be getting any more.
1	Grateful for the COVID-19 vaccine! A powerful tool in our fight against the pandemic!
1	60 million Americans got Swine flu. 12,000 died. 0.02% Current USA fatality rate for #COVID19: 1.3% 60 million Americans with COVID19 = 750,000 dead. UK: 5% Italy: 9% There is no vaccine. No immunity. Do you see a difference yet?
1	That is great, SXSW is so important to the city. I honestly think the COVID19 is going to be around for a long time, best hope is a vaccine next year. There is a lot of really helpful info from the Hill brief from Johns Hopkins today.
0	So they all are gonna make debates through my body about the mandatory vaccination, but I am gonna shut up, not look it up and come into the line like a sheep. Is that so?
1	I'm not antivax in the slightest, but there is no way I'm signing up for something so rushed that hasn't gone through thorough testing and trials.
0	I did not get the jab...don't trust big pharma.  This is huge!!!  My heart goes out to all the victims of this molotov cocktail...
0	My side effects from not getting it … healthy and no soreness
0	The damage is done...the only reason why they are coming out with this report is to try to appear to the world as if they are being transparent and taking the proper safety precautions ...
0	Not against vaccines, but I'm just questioning the rush
1	Imagine being able to say you were part of the team that created the covid-19 vaccine. You could literally do nothing else for the rest of your life and still be more accomplished than 99.9% of people.
1	I never got the jab and im fine
1	Not throwing away my shot #Science #vaccinated #AdventHealth #PfizerBioNTech #grateful
0	Taking medical advice from Fauxci is like taking health and fitness advice from Lizzo.
0	I personally know 11 people including family that died from COVID injections.
1	Scientist, proud of vaccine development and testing, safe and effective way to protect loved ones.
1	I got it and I wasn’t feeling too hot the next day but tbh it wasn’t that bad so I’d say it’s definently worth it
1	Seeing the effects of COVID firsthand, I'm thankful we have vaccines to protect us.
0	Nobody who refused the vaccine has regrets dude. However, some who took the vaccine do.
0	I personally know 11 people including family that died from COVID injections.
0	Studying vaccine development prior to the COVID outbreak gave me all the information I needed to refuse the new vaccines. Best decision I ever made
0	What a fool. Smart move to train your immune system to attack spike proteins! Hope it doesn't cause miscarriages for pregnant women!
0	Stop putting that poison in you
0	the first covid vaccine I got gave me heart palpitations, no thanks.
0	My best friend's husband, a healthy hockey trainer, ended up having to get a pacemaker due to unexplained heart issues after the 2nd shot. They tried doing it through the vein, but too many clots. After that, he had multiple mini-strokes.
1	Think of vaccines not just as protection for yourself, but as a way to contribute to the greater good. Let's end this pandemic together!
0	For the first time in history, the ineffectiveness of a medication is being blamed on those who have NOT taken it.
0	Never took the jab, refused and lost my job. Now I am working again for the gov. Still never had it.
0	I had chest discomfort after the first dose and saw my doc who did a ekg and echo discovering I had a atrial septal defect now I’m scared to get second shot and going to see a cardiologist next week
1	So grateful for this scientific marvel! Vaccination is our best shot at ending this pandemic. Let's all do our part and get vaccinated!
1	As far as I know, the best way to an anti-vaxxer vaccinated is have an outbreak near them so they see an immediate, negative consequence. Measles vaccination rates have always gone up after an outbreak.
1	I am vaccinated and had to pick up a vaccinated elderly relative with a positive COVID test from the hospital. 14 days out neither of us has symptoms. I talked to a friend yesterday who did not get vaccinated. She has been in the hospital for two weeks and is "weak as a kitten". She couldn't find anyone else to pick her up, so I'm going to get her home. Get vaccinated so you can help your family and friends. This virus is not a joke.
1	Unless your doctor told you not to get the vaccine, I'd get it. Since you're in college, you're legally an adult. Your parents can't prevent you from getting the vaccine. Nor are you obligated to tell them whether or not you were vaccinated.
0	As a nurse, witnessed people who have experienced blood clots, myocarditis, serious autoimmune issues following the shots, the doctors will not admit it's the shots and leave the person stranded. It's so awful, I can't recommend them (nurse).
1	Vaccinated for the greater good, but also because I want to get back to concerts and festivals
1	Darwinism in action. Those who understand science survive.
0	As always, thank you. I went through a lot of verbal abuse from family and others for refusing the shot.
0	I dont beleive at all that covid jabs are safe, the goverment has a lot to answer for
1	Bye Felicia. You have the right not to get vaccinated and I have the right to giggle as you turn blue
0	My family we will NEVER take the vaccine or any boosters. Total distrust of any government agencies now more than ever.
1	Vaccines are one of the most cost-effective healthcare interventions available.
0	do some proper research and realise these vaccines had serious long term side effects in all animal trials...and these vaccines are not approved.
1	get excited for that 4th shot in like 3 months
0	people were injected with experimental vaccines
0	I let you guys be the test subjects
1	Still unvaccinated, and couldn’t be happier.
0	I worked with one person who died and 3 others that wound up in the ICU from COVID. These are the ONLY people I know that had severe issues with the virus...and they were all vaccinated.
1	Got my first Pfizer jab about 22 hours ago. Feeling great, no side effects except for a slightly sore arm. Apparently the second vaccine hits harder though with chills fever and fatigue (which is a normal reaction after getting vaccinated).
1	Thank u for all the medical staff all around the world for working to prevent this disease
1	The vaccine is to reduce your chances of dying, not eliminating them, just reducing them.  Even with flu, its Russian Roulette every year, but with a jab it reduces, even slightly, then chance of real illness.  A chance some are willing to take
1	thanks for bring rule to get vaccinated. so people are aware of it and they are getting vaccinated.
1	Vaccinated individuals are less likely to experience severe complications from infections.
1	Amazing, really shows how good vaccines are!
1	Got Vaccinated ! #Jabbed #Vaccinated
0	At this point, getting another Covid shot is a sign of profound mental illness
1	I take every chance I get to attempt to educate people around me about Covid and the vaccines. I'm not confrontational, I just give them the facts as I know them and hope they will make the right decision. No matter how much I want to shake them and tell
1	I just had my first shot of AstraZeneca vaccine last March 22nd.
1	What I don't understand is if your child cannot be vaccinated due to adverse affects, why would you then advocate for anti vaccination? Your child is now a part of the group that relies on herd immunity...advocating for anti-vax just puts your own child a
0	Vaccination requirements are in direct violation of the 1st amendment.Congress shall make no law respecting . . .or the right of the people peaceably to assemble,First, I have to 'check-in' with the Government?This will not stand.
1	Vaccine's a testament to modern science. Amazing stuff.
1	Public. Health. Is. Not. Political. And if you believe it is, you have been indoctrinated by some truly awful ideas.
1	I'm 70 and believe I'm a reasonably literate and intelligent adult. Thus far, I've received each and every covid-19 vaccination and booster recommended by the medical community — despite the fact that I've had a high fever and aching muscles for two to three days after each shot. I'm willing to deal with that discomfort so long as I'm convinced doing so is the price of substantially reducing my risk of severe illness from covid-19 infection, as well as reducing the likelihood I will transmit the disease to others.
1	we should get a vaccine not for ourselves but for others
1	together we can make a difference by getting vaccinated
0	My dear friend passed away at 40 years old from a brain aneurysm less thank two weeks ago. Her mom died of a brain aneurysm 4 days later. I really hope that the doctors in the same hospital look closely at these cases and whether or not the aneurysms were caused by the booster.
0	My view is that nothing should pierce the skin.
0	By not taking the shots I am 100% safe from adverse reactions and 99.98% safe from Covid
1	I will never understand the ignorance of people. Get your kids vaccines!!
1	Even when I have a shitty day, at least I can come to this sub and feel a little bit better about the choices I have made in life. GET VACCINATED!
0	I personally know of four that died after their first jab.  Two others now have rare cancers after their jabs.   Must be climate change!
1	Every single antivaxxer should be forced to listen to this podcast will kill you. It does a great job of describing the horror of these diseases.
0	36 years old, always very athletic and healthy. Myocarditis after 1st shot (next day). Life changed completely. No improvement since November
0	Until my last day on earth. I'd would never ever again listening to the government about my health again.
0	Vaccines are just a ploy by big pharma to make money.
1	I think I’ve lost track of how many Covid shots I’ve had but I’ll take as many as they tell me to
0	I am a 49 year old male and was fine before vaccination and now i have chronic heat urticaria
0	More vaccines, yay! We can totally believe the claims this time, totally.
0	Haven't had a vaccine in 6 years, I recommend we quit vaccines for less threatening diseases.
0	You know what's better than three doses? Four. Four is the magic number.
1	I'm getting it because I can and want to be ahead of everyone else who needs it more.
0	As a nurse 10 years in the NHS,  I'm so glad I did my resurch and refused the vaccine! That dr who said on main  streem media prob saved my life by saying the sicence don't back the mandate!!!
1	I'm fully vaccinated and boosted. I have COVID right now! It feels like a mild cold.  The first time I got COVID was before I was vaccinated. I got a lung infection and coughed so much my throat bled. I felt like crap for months afterwards.
1	After careful research, I chose to get vaccinated and protect those around me
0	You blindly believe and trust that it isn't corruptible, forcing others to ignore evidence they can see with their own eyes and instead blindly trust a study that was bought and paid for by both the big pharma and gov forcing you to take it.
1	Shoutout to Pfizer for keeping us healthy.
0	Nah, I heard some bad stuff about side effects. Gonna pass
0	Im very sorry to break it to you sir, but my family has been vax and boosted and has had covid many times, and im not and i never get sick, so i mean what you are saying makes no sense at all,  heres a tip  ive said from the very beginning, keep your hands washed, natural immunity,
1	I am vaccinated and my partner is vaccinated. Our children will be vaccinated. I look at it this way, I would rather them have a little pain from a tiny pinch from a needle than a lot of pain from the scary diseases.
0	My moms body filled up with blood clots after her booster. She just died from a stroke 6 months later.
0	"They're afraid to put things in their body" THAT is actually a GOOD reason. People need to stop judgment others for the choices they make.
0	Pre cov,I was a very busy hairdresser working from home . Thursday's were always my busy days as I did my "oldies". 11-12 clients on average ,all able bodied ladies ,driving,walking or catching the bus here. In the last two years 10 of them have died . I begged them all to not get jabbed and everyone laughed at me except one. The one that's didn't get jabbed is a 76 years old and she still comes every week to get her hair done . One of my clients (a fit health gent 62 years old ) passed away less than 48 hours after his first .
1	thank you all the scientists in all over the world working for this vaccine! And everyone in hospitals working very hard.
0	I'm SO glad I'm not the only one who still trusts his gut feeling and discernment about things! Just because the government and some doctors, in whom many of us trust, press people to follow through with something, it does NOT mean there's justification behind it. I did not allow nor encourage my family to get the poison.
0	I have an Immune system like King Kongs Cousin , I don't want to mess that up...
0	Man I just got my first job out of school. Boss was an old right winger and did get the vaxx. Explained to me how I sadly had to get the vaccine as we worked in hospitals. I told him my reasons not to. I ended up quitting haha but on my last day, a guy from a big design firm in Michigan said “hey take your COVID preparedness plan out of your proposal. We think that’s behind us.” I’m so lucky I quit that job and I remain vaxx free. 3 years!! Bartending at the busiest bar in my city. COVID may be real but the way the media and governments tried to control us was unreal.
1	I'm not anti vax, as people love to say, I'm pro choice, for every medical choice there is. It's up to you, just make educated choices. I honestly don't know how people are even arguing otherwise.
0	yall treated vaccination as the end all for covid and now we're forced to work while sick and vaccined bc you thought they care about our health
1	Cried with relief that an RSV vaccine is approved! It's no joke. Staying in a crowded ICU with a brand new newborn is awful. But now that doesn't have to happen!
1	I am so embarrased for my friends who won't take the shot…
1	To use a famous line: "Let them die"
0	My mother told me " Never take drugs from convicted felons with legal indemnity .
1	Got very excited and tried to find a local pharmacist in NI but sadly nothing as yet.
0	Vaccine? No thanks. Heard it's like getting a hangover without the party. Sticking to good ol' vitamin C and fresh air.
0	My mother died from a heart attack a few months ago after she took the vaccine. She’s never had cardiovascular problems in her life
1	Because of media attention. There is no evidence AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine is more dangerous than breating is.
0	Let's be honest; most doctors knew this vaccine was dangerous a couple of years ago. Doctors need to begin speaking out. Better late than never.
0	Yeah. Don't mention it depletes the human immune system.
1	AMAZING NEWS!!!! Good job Pfizer and American ingenuity!!! This is a win for the entire world!!!!!
1	It is safe. Anti vaxxers are so passionate about this topic because it’s the first time their lives they’ve felt so intelligent
0	Stop lying about the vaccine
0	I'm unvaxxed. I caught covid but it lasted less than a day. Work gave me 2 weeks paid leave so I went on a holiday. My cousin was vaxxed and had 2 boosters. She caught covid and was bed ridden for a month. Poor thing
1	Cleveland Clinic study did NOT show an increase in covid infections among vaccinated employees. The preliminary report was seized on by antivaxxers and conspiracy theorists to bolster their inaccurate beliefs. You're welcome.
1	Let me get this straight it's a fairly new technology but its safe.
0	My mother was healthy with mild arthritis before the "vaccine". After the vaccine and the subsequent booster shots she developed pneumonia Parkinson's severe rashes and full-blown arthritis!!! She was a strong healthy woman now 3 years later she is wheelchair-bound in a nursing home!!!
0	I've heard about some side effects, and it's hard to ignore that. I want to be safe, but I'm worried about what the vaccine could do.
0	i’m unvaccinated against COVID and i honestly am so happy i never got it
0	Those scientists are murderers go to JAIL!!!!
1	And both of his parents were vaccinated and got Covid-19, yet I feel they did survive. He didn't.
0	This vaccine was all by design and perfectly orchestrated..I'm afraid we haven't seen nothing yet...
1	This isn’t a parental debate/decision, it’s about public health!!
1	I had the Pfizer one as well and had a upset stomach. So happy you got your vaccine!! Hope John can soon ! Thank you for saving lives !
1	Shortly after birth, I was given a vaccination against  whooping cough. When I was a toddler I was ill, our doctor told my parents it was just a caugh, and they could take me a few hundred miles to visit grandparents, he said it woild be fine.  This cough wouldnt settle, so mum took me for a walk (we were still with my grandparents at that point,) and we went to the village chemist. Well the cemist heard my caugh, lifted me from the buggy and dialed 999,  At the hospital my parents were told that I had such a severe strain of whooping caugh, I would more likely Have died within a short time of contracting it.  A vaccination wont prevent you getting it, but if you do that injection may save your life it saved mine. (I was born in the early 1970's) So glad my parents had the sense to ignore the scaremongers and vaccinate their children.
0	I have several friends who I've known for 20+ years, so I know their history. As soon as they took the vaccine, their bodies went haywire. I didn't take it (and never will), and I'm just fine
0	I’ve seen people on my Instagram tell me about harmful things the FDA has also approved. Should I be concerned or is it okay for me to get vaccinated now?
1	Way better taking the shot than being intubated at a hospital!
1	66% of U.S Covid deaths were anti-vax Republicans, allowing Democrats to make great gains with vax and masks....
1	Of course she caught it from a vaccinated person. She just knows.
1	None of the anti-vaxxers should be allowed in a hospital
0	vaccines aren't really a political thing. it's more to do whether you are an idiot or not.
1	Got the moderrna vaccine and still got Covid bad ended up in hospital 4 days . Maybe the vax saved my life but  I was really scared when I had a 105.5 fever
1	i was super anxious to get mine because of my health anxiety, but I researched it a bunch and got it and i’m so happy I did.
1	i'm more than excited to get vaccinated! and because of this video, i'm more than determined to share this towards my family and friends. kudos to the team behind this video!
0	The crime of the century, And imagine that guy coming towards you in your hospital bed
1	The unvaccinated COVID positive people are overrunning our hospital… 90% in ICU unvaccinated … I’ll take the vaccine and a much lower chance at ending up in the ICU every time.
1	And, for the record, #VaccinesWork and most folks have no issues with vaccines. I’ve had 5 Covid vaccines & every other vaccine that is recommended & I am perfectly fine.
1	If they are skeptical about doctors and not trusting them, who’s to say the research they did is also not lying to them? Did they go to a trusted source?
0	What are the long term side affects, oh, wait no one knows
1	I vaccinated today Sinovax Chinese vaccine. I hope it's okay
1	Please find one confirmed study that shows vaccines aren't harmful.  My problem is that no one has studied it on humans using placebo methods, and until then, it's unknown and the only thing we can use is anactdotal evidence and scientific possiblity of vaccines causing illness.
0	No it's not safe
1	I’m a flight attendant who has been fully vaccinated (both shots) with the Pfizer brand vaccine, I feel fine and I haven’t had real side effects. Idk if someone needed to read this to help them make their own decision but I hope you go for it yourself. Wishing everyone the best through all of this.
1	I'm optimistic about the impact of the vaccine on public health.
0	Oh yeah they work in your favour by killing everyone off.
0	So quick to roll out these vaccines, but no long-term studies? Sounds irresponsible to me
0	Thank you Mr Biden. You are the reason why I m unvaxxed
1	Get the boosters, you wont suffer long.
0	I've seen reports of people dying or experiencing severe reactions shortly after receiving the vaccine. It's too risky for me
1	Just got my first dose today! My parents finally snapped out of their bubble and thought: oh, shit. Should we risk a fairly new vaccine (Pfizer) that doesn’t have life threatening side effects, or should we risk the possibility our children could end up on ventilators or dead? I get their fear when it came to Pfizer, but damn. I’d be more afraid of Covid. We know people that have died from Covid, who’ve ended up needing intense medical treatment, and begged for a vaccine.
1	I got vaccinated to protect not just myself, but my community.
1	The anti vaxxers will die so no problem
0	Who else got fired cause refused to get a covid-19 vaccine?
0	"And now, how do we revive those who had a heart attack due to the shot?"
1	H.mmmmm.    still not vaccinated.... still fine .
0	Yeah I still haven't gotten any of the vaccines.
1	We're in the endgame now.
1	A-Fucking-Men to that I had Autism when I was BORN, years after I was born, I got vaccinated... to antivax people... do the math...
0	Nobody will ask if the deceased was vaxxed! And that‘s why people will stay dormant! What a mess!
0	This didn't convince me to get a covid vaccine, but it did prove that education and intelligence are two different things
0	I'm healthy, and the survival rate is high. No need for a vaccine. #RiskAssessment
1	Giving booster dose to health care workers and the aged is a good step
1	Joining the millions who trust science and are now vaccinated against COVID-19. Here's to health and happiness ahead!
0	I'm older than him, had Delta variant, never got vaxxed, and haven't had it again since. Perhaps the problem is that by putting all that pharma in his body, he damaged his body's ability to fight.
1	Vax works!!
0	I'm 71, not sick, not jabbed, not masked, not tested, not afraid. I breathe deeply and keep my immune system active.
0	PASS
0	Where do you see the turbo cancer debunking? Don't believe it. Don't believe anything that media, fact checkers, FDA, CDC, NIH, or anyone else say now. How long have you been getting sick for? Since the unrolling of the vax a few years ago? There have been other people on this sub that identify the same symptom of vulnerability to infection. Several weeks ago, there was one person that said that he/she had to wear an N95 mask taped to the face, otherwise every time he/she got back from the store/work/whatever he/she would get sick. I saw something today about Canada releasing some numbers along the same lines that people were more vulnerable. Do you take any vitamin supplements? Vitamin D was found to significantly reduce covid infections in a research paper a few years ago. When you get sick, you could try something like ivermectin. It's over the counter in some states. India made it through the delta variant by handing it out like candy prophylactically to everyone. Here is a way you can get some alternative information. There's a Russian search engine called yandex that I started using that doesn't censor like our "tech" companies do. Maybe you can find something there.
0	All over the world people are dying from the vaccines. The WHO continuing to push more vaccines, is a continuation of their plan for depopulation.
0	Not sold on the vaccine, especially with how fast it came out. Seems sus
1	I had the #COVID19 Vaccine. It’s completely safe to take I hope my photo will help encourage those who are nervous to take the vaccine.
0	Jesus wasn’t vaccinated, just saying
1	each vaccine dose brings us closer to a world free from disease
1	For the first time in history, the ineffectiveness of a medication is being blamed on those who have NOT taken it.
0	Biggest mistake of my life was taking the shot to get my wife out of lockdown. 2 years later and I still have heart problems and thrombosis in my legs. F the entire medical mafia.
0	I don't care what they say about risk over benefits.  Where are all the trials that prove this thing has no long term effects.     Oh that's right they're are none.
0	I was chastised and ridiculed for not gerting vaccinated. There was no way I would willingly or be forced to put that crap in my body!
0	I’m unvaccinated and got covid 2 days ago, it’s not as bad as they make out
0	vaxxers are spreading diseases, not preventing them. they're the real threat!
1	A vaccine is the best and only way to return to life as “normal,” or closer to what it was before COVID-19.
1	Fully vaccinated (both doses of the Moderna vaccine)  Is getting my booster shot as soon as I can get it.
0	Glad I said no to the jab and stood my ground despite the challenges from friends and families. I don't trust the system, period.
1	the line that parents know best about their kids works for personalities but definitely not about their health
1	“Covid is spread by the mouth and nose, but most of all by assholes.”
1	I got Pfizer and I like that
0	the vaccine industry profits off creating fear and selling false security!!!
1	Vaccines are like a shield against disease
1	Fair enough I’m convinced
1	its crucial to prioritize vaccination and not delay in getting vaccinated
0	Do you know what doesn't exist? A single human who regrets NOT taking those shots.
0	A bio wapon
1	The risk of contracting Covid and then having severe consequences is much higher for the elderly than the risks of dying from the side effects. Much higher.
1	Except for clean water and hand hygiene, one of the most significant health initiatives to decrease disease is effective vaccine programs. Millions of people around the world have benefited from these programs. The COVID-19 vaccine was safely developed and tested and has a high efficacy rate, meaning it works.
1	Nurse here. The general population is blissfully unaware of how fucking sketchy medical care has gotten as a direct result of these antivax psychos. I would fully support legislation mandating those choosing to not be vaccinated become DNR/DNI’s.
1	It’s hilarious how the same people who are afraid of the Covid vaccine aren’t afraid of the meth made in their cousin Cletus’s filthy tool shed.
0	Those people who did not get the vaccine are very happy can't say the same about the people that got vaccinated
0	Not true actually the vaccine makes you sicker my sister got a covid vaccine and she got like really sick the next day she was sick for like 3 weeks and then started to recover
1	Vaccines have a long history of eradicating deadly diseases, and COVID-19 is no different.
1	Every year, millions of people refuse to get the flu and pneumonia vaccines, they get sick, get other's sick, thousands die. Next year, there'll be a #COVID19 vaccine. Millions will refuse to get it, they will get sick, get other's sick, thousands will die. This is man's hubris.
0	Red Flags were there all along. Since the very beginning all dissenting opinions and therapeutics were ridiculed and silenced. That was enough for many of us to know something was very wrong with this shot.
1	I have been getting the annual flu shot for over a decade, no issues.  I dont see why you are so worried.  Vaccines have been very safe over the past two hundred years.
1	happy to take booster 5. keep everyone safe yall!
0	My heart bleeds for all the people who took the jab. Because they were frightened scared or coerced into it. That they would loose their jobs homes unable to feed their children. It's not right to say I told u so etc. These people trusted and believed what they were told. They are the innocents. Gov etc are evil. And I hope their is justice for the people injured and lost their lives. May their souls rest in peace
1	It's actually sad that a non-medical Prime Minister has a better grip on the safety profile of COVID vaccines than a nurse with a PhD like
1	I did it. Moderna first shot at the VA in Broward county. #veteran #MiamiVA #vaccinationdone #moderna @ Broward VA Outpatient Clinic
0	So is he saying the old one doesn’t work?
0	Shoutout to the smart ones who didn’t take any Covid shots
1	As a 27-year-old musician, I got my appointment within an hour of them going up this week, because I. WANT. TO. PLAY. SHOWS. AGAIN!!!
1	As a biochemist in training I can't stress enough how incredible this mechanism is: logical, simple yet incredibly effective and beautiful.
0	I don't trust the COVID vaccine because it was developed too quickly and under a lot of pressure, which makes me question its safety and efficacy.
1	I got my vaccination and I feel excellent because I think it is important and I want to protect my community and my family.
0	was told by my childs cardiologist to get us all vaccinated to protect him! I'm beyond furious! He was fine , but we're still suffering side effects!
0	How about people who get the vaccine and down the road have severe complications . My x got it and is now in stage 5 kidney disease.
1	I'm not an anti-vaxxer, but I was hesitant to get the COVID-19 vaccine at first. But after doing my research, I realized that the benefits of vaccination outweigh the risks. I'm so glad I got vaccinated, and I recommend it to everyone.
0	I regret it, I have tinnitus now because of it
0	For everyone: I have never gotten the flu shot and have never gotten the flu. I never got the covid vaccine and never got covid. Same for everyone in my family.
0	Don’t do it please. U will never feel the same .
1	I'll take it. And the RSV vaccine, and the annual flu shot.
0	Yes I decided to stop 10 months before it was confirmed I was right.  My mother in law passed and I predicted it.  We miss her so much. But I think we had to go through it to confirm that I will never let anyone poison my children again.
0	2 people passed in my family one after 2 dose , 1 after 15 days of first shot, both were healthy prior vaccination
0	The minute they started talking about a 'vaccine' and before it was released I knew we were in trouble.
0	I survived the biggest pysop to ever be  perpertrated on humanity since the dawn of time. I'm not vaccinted and i'm still here.
1	Considering that there are those who stick to their guns after watching their family members die of Covid, this man's attitude after getting infected is a huge improvement.
0	I'm skeptical of any medication that has such rapid approval. It makes me wonder what corners were cut in the process.
0	What is the cause of the rise of autism?  I'm not saying it is the vaccine but it jumps as we give more vaccines
0	All i need to know is that like all the others im not taking it
1	Remember dying from and with covid are two different things…
1	I disagree: vaccines ARE a cure for the pandemic in society as a whole. They are not a cure for an individual's sickness.
0	I am unvaccinated and don't have any regrets.
1	There are children who died from vaccines but they died because of a totally diff reason they died because they were allergic to an ingredient and not because of the vaccines themselves   Stop being a piece of shit and vax your children unless you want them to die (excluding children who can't get vaxxed)   You are a complete idiot if you are claiming that vaccines cause autism, autism is a genetic disease kids get before they're born therefore claiming that vaccines cause autism is complete nonsense  Don't use big words like phosphorus or ammonium which you have 0 knowledge of, there's phosphorus in an apple that doesn't make it harmful  The fact this has to come from a 13 yr old shows how bad this is. So basically fuck off with your vaccines cause autism shit  Ya wrong and you are going to get someone killed    Stop dis and go see an expert  Edit: removed gay as an insult
0	This Covid vaccination shit ain’t nothing but a new world order.
1	"If I get vaccinated, can I protect others or only myself? In other words, does each person protect themselves with their vaccination and also protect others?"
0	WHO are you feeling the pressure from the big Pharma's again? They must have a big surplus of vaccines/boosters and they need you again to delivery their products. Guess what? People are not taking this BS again...
0	Money under the table doctors are saying it's safe, you can bet your life on it.
0	These aren't "side effects", they're effects.
1	It is because when you are vaccinated it doesn’t prevent u from getting Covid, rather lessening the symptoms as ur immune system has created anti-bodies designed to attack and kill the same disease. So essentially you can still become a carrier of covid however your symptoms may not be as severe and you may not be a carrier for as long depending on how strong ur immune system is.
0	My son got ITP thrombocytopenia. Within two weeks of his pfizer booster. On admittance to hospital his platelet count was 4,000, thats life threatening. He spent two weeks in the hospital getting courses of IV platelets, no help. Finally splenectomy. Still taking Steroids to keep immune response down, but last platelet count was 139,000. This mRNA vaccine needs further studies done and honest data collection on how many deaths and side effects are really happening
0	I've had 2 covid vaccines, and I've been suffering from more infections and ill health than my previous record of 15 years with only 2 - 3 days off work due to sickness.
0	It’s honestly unreal the way the vaccines were pushed as if they were the miracle cure and everyone who was against it was basically chastised and shunned. And now more and more evidence is coming out vindicating the people who were hesitant. From this to recent report that yes Covid almost certainly did in fact come from a lab.
1	This film made me get the vaccine. I just got it last night! Medical teams, including maintenance, are the best, may God bless them!
0	I will not have myself or my kids or husband vaccinated. So here we go for the FIGHT OF OUR LIVES.
0	I am so sorry for those of us who took the vaccine! I've had so many issues with my breast since the Vaccine! Wish I had never taken it :(
0	It's true, the continuing of giving these experimental Covid mRNA vaccines, and the potent senior flu vaccines are killing off our seniors. Basically they make them ill, they have horrible side effects and when seniors fall, get blood clots etc. etc. it's hard for them to come back from that and that's why they're dying! It's sickening the pushing of all this experimental and ineffective stuff ￼
0	I just hope you all remember for the next plandemic - which is coming - and don't fall for it again.. that's you too, John.
1	After months of waiting, I finally got my first dose of the Moderna vaccine. Feeling optimistic about the road ahead!
0	my friend lost his kid to it. my moms friend died to it. and I hear storys evreyday about it. and all this info gets banned anyways. disgusting government and disgusting fauci
0	We all know it’s the Jabby. And these evil people push for it still… crazy
1	I just got my shot yesterday (couldn't get one earlier). Feel great aside from some small aches.
1	To everyone who has been vaccinated, thank you!
0	I am unvaccinated and don't have any regrets.
1	Thinning the herd of the unvaccinated
1	"I take vitamins and I'm pretty healthy" Famous last words.
0	Many pro-vaccine scientists are throwing their careers away to warn people not to take any of the vaccines. This is a red flag for me.
1	As soon as my LO is 6 months old, he’s definitely getting flu & covid vaccinations
1	I plan to get the Vaccine as soon as it’s available. Thank you President Trump for all you did to make this happen so soon.
0	I personally know of four that died after their first jab. Two others now have rare cancers after their jabs. Must be climate change!
0	My mother died of a stroke after her second vaccine. She’d never had a stroke before.
0	I've read about severe side effects, and that scares me.
0	I personally know 11 people including family that died from COVID injections.
0	Pfizer and Moderna vaccines claim to be 95% effective from Covid “symptom” why the fuck are we injecting #AstraZenaca that’s 62% ... I’m no doctor but the numbers don’t lie
0	Likely an illusion. Wasn’t there over 220 cases of VITT only for a vaccine that wasn’t heavily used? 3.5k total healthy people under 60 died of COVID. I’d say cost benefit is likely negative. There are all kinds of statistical fiddling that goes on in trials.
0	Waiting to see how others react to the vaccine before deciding
0	Glad I said no to the jab and stood my ground despite the challenges from friends and families. I don't trust the system, period.
1	Y'know I'm glad there are doctors taking the time to educate people about the vaccine
1	I just got my second vaccine and I feel relieved. Now I can spend a little bit more time outside without a mask on and be around my family without concerns of possibly getting my parents sick and maybe getting back to normal.
1	There are “over 100 million eligible citizens” who won’t even take a free vaccine, who are spreading COVID everyday. Over 300 thousand new positive cases just today. Why don’t you target the most dangerous group first, the unvaccinated!
0	I did not want the shots but was forced as a nurse. Got the first two Pfizer and got horribly ill. Refused the boosters and have been harassed over it. It’s been two years and I’m living with side effects from it. Extreme fatigue, vision issues, and heart palpitations. I applaud this girl standing up for what is right. The way people are treated who said no to the vaccines is disgusting, their concerns are real and should be listened to.
1	Initially I to was against the vaccine until I actually got covid. Covid is very scary when you get all the symptoms. The worst is when it affects your breathing. You feel light headed,dizzy, and very weak. It legit feels like you might die. My whole family got covid but I got it the worse since I wasn't vaccinated and I regret it.
0	Some day the truth will come out and people will realize who was deliberately deceiving them and who was speaking the truth. And when they realize their health has been compromised by the very people they trusted, the people will not stop until they know exactly who set this pandemic into motion and deliberately destroyed their health.
0	My sister's ex husband had just gone into remission from cancer and was told he had a good chance of complete recovery.They talked him into getting the vaccine bc he was in a"high risk group" and 2 weeks later he died.At the autopsy blood clots were found throughout his body.
1	I got vaccinated to reduce the strain on our healthcare system.
1	As one of the immune compromised people who will likely not be able to get this vaccine, I thank you for this message, it does give me more hope, and hope is the thing with feathers.
0	I won't risk the unknown side effects of these vaccines on my children.
0	Doesn't matter I'm not getting any of them, haven't gotten any of them still alive
1	Getting my Pfizer vaccine today! Thank you science and scientists!
0	Please, for the love of God, dont get this. I know SOOOOOO many people who've had serious health decline within months of getting the second dose
0	I do know of 3 people that died from pulmonary or heart clots and one that is on a wheel chair and can't speak within 3 days of either the first or second vax shot yet non who have died from Covid.
1	It'll be such a relief hearing people are getting the vaccine.. even if it's slow at first, it'll be great to get some good news.
1	Vaccination are proven to work and have saved countless of lives. Getting my jab asap
0	Unvaxed for life
0	I was never an antivaxxer before 2020. But now I can see all the lies and corruption. You can have all the jabs you want. Im not.
0	This aged so well. Even my elderly parents are like “no more vaccines”. They blew all the belief in the medical establishment in 2 years…
1	Vaccines are safe and effective, and we should all get them to protect ourselves and our loved ones.
0	Lots of people regretting getting jabbed.  None regretted not getting it.  End of story.  Good luck folks with the truth. It’s right there in front of you,  like the pink elephant in the room.
0	Why it should be this way i mean why we can't just make a conventional vaccine to fight COVID-19. Why it should to be m RNA?
1	Oh also I got my first vaccine appointment on Wednesday! :D
0	I’ve been yelling bio weapon from day one just to be laughed at...so sad
0	"Vaccine mandates infringe on personal freedom and choice. It should be an individual decision."
0	"I'm concerned about the lack of long-term studies on the vaccine's effects, especially for younger individuals."
0	I am so relieved I did not take it and neither did my husband or kids. I can sleep at night knowing that poison is not in us. It disgusts me that people who hang onto ignorance because they are scared it's in them can't look around at all the people speaking out. All the young people who collapsed and died is heart breaking
0	I've had zero shots and I don't regret it
1	We have been saying for months that we need to take COVID seriously.
1	Right.Vaccines are effective. It works for herd immunity. Get vaccinated.
1	I had no trouble with any of the covid jabs I got.
1	Near me there are groups of parents that actively seek out doctors that won’t judge them for choosing to not vaccinate. They do this while naming and shaming the practices that insist on patients being vaccinated. It’s all incredibly weird.
1	Yay!!!
1	I love the covid vaccine
0	Shame on everyone who coerced or pressured people to take that shot.
0	please LORD JESUS protect the human family from the elites from poisoning us
0	My heart bleeds for all the people who took the jab because they was scared frightened or coerced into taking it.
0	I will never take the shot or wear the mask.
1	I think Einstein said that intelligence is measured by the ability to adapt, & flexibility. Republicans could die out.
0	Not a single one of us regrets not getting the jab…NOT ONE.
1	Idk I think he wooshed himself lol.  Anyone who doesn’t understand herd immunity is a dumb. Vaccines are important until we figure out how to actually stop the spread of sicknesses.   So maybe not anti vax how about pro disease?
1	I'm glad she's masking, but what on earth is that supposed to do if her parents aren't?
0	how can people still comply with expert advice when the experts keep lying as they did through the whole pandemic. I choose to listen to the experts who don't go with the mainstream narrative and that stand to lose something.
0	My dad died of heart attack 3 days after taking the shot.
1	After I got my vaccine, I feel safe.
1	It is crucial to prioritize vaccination and not delay in getting vaccinated.
1	I’m excited to get it honestly
0	Brought to you by Pfizer.
0	NOBODY I KNOW IS THIS OKAY WITH THIS. HOW DO WE EVEN KNOW THE LONG TERM EFFECTS OF THIS NEW TYPE OF VACCINE?
0	I'm not getting it. I'm not anti vax or anything. I'm young and healthy and my body always handles sickness very well. I want my body to learn to handle it on its own. I don't get flu shots for the same reason.
0	I didn't need the shot because my perfectly functional immune system sorted the issue out for me.
0	Yeah, nah.
1	I just got vaccinated with moderna (mRNA) yesterday. So far so good I have no side effects
1	Pump me full of this stuff, to protect me from the idiots of my county
0	I have never been vaccinated and planning not ever to get one or two dose of it. My mom had been vaccinated and my sister but I'm not because I don't want to. It's sad that despite these cases, government even here in the Philippines making it mandatory and instituted a no vax no ride policy which is really unconstitutional and yet against on Human Rights!
0	I'd suffered with CFS for 15yrs at the time of the onset of the pandemic. My gut feeling told me not to get the vaccination, but I was given a really hard time about it. Thank goodness I listened to my gut! So thankful for this information 🙏
0	I wouldn't recommend it to anyone in good health.
1	Scientist's pride, celebrating vaccine development, protecting loved ones from COVID-19.
0	im fine, i take my supplements
1	Vaccines always have a small side effect! there is nothing to be afraid of!
0	As an Australian, I am embarrassed for our citizens and irate at our Government officials for forcing this onto the general public. So many lives lost and damaged... this cannot go unnoticed and is unforgivable...
0	Seizures (very rare)
0	if you are vaccinated why do you care whether she has it or not? You are protected right?? Or are you admitting, like every other vaxxer that THEY DON'T WORK…
0	The government fired thousands of service members for not getting the clot shot. 2 years later, now they are trying to hire them back. Service members who were denied exemptions and had to find other jobs to feed their families
1	Receiving the vaccine felt like a small yet significant victory against the challenges posed by the pandemic.
0	There are other ways to protect oneself . It is not necessarily to be vaccinated.
1	As someone in their mid-twenties who had a mild (read: non-hospitalized, but still a bad time) case of COVID in January, who is still feeling Long COVID symptoms almost five months later (Some that were way worse than the aforementioned bad time of having
0	The jabbed are victims of mass formation psychosis. They are not easy to wake using the normal method of presenting facts
1	Someone should explain to him that there is no vaccine for COVID-19, &; that before vaccines existed, the pandemic flu of 1918 killed 50 million people, 3 times as many people as were killed in World War I. This is not the time to down play the threat &; turn our back on science.
1	My dad did and we didn't have any issues
1	A friend of mine just lost her dad who was not vaccinated, my mom who is the healthiest person I know got it and is still struggling with her breathing 1 year later. I got covid before getting vaccinated a year ago and still haven't completely recovered from taste and smell. Honestly I wouldn't hesitate to get vaccinated.
0	You will be held accountable for actions.. this  is medical tyranny
1	Found it extremely helpful
1	Get this out to all the essential workers and elderly stat. I am happy to wait in my splendid home office isolation until the weather turns to spring!
0	I understand the need for widespread vaccination, but I wish there was more transparent information available about adverse reactions.
0	Like politicians preaching morals, while religious preachers preach politics...
0	I won't be getting that shot. No way in hell.
0	If your parents got dementia after getting the COVID vaccine, it's likely the vaccine that did it.
0	Show the trial data for the "new" covid shot, oh......
1	Vaccination is a civic duty to help end the pandemic. It's up to us
0	During a vaccination session: Patient: Does it guarantee immunity ? Doctor: Only for the manufacturers.
1	This is dedicated to all of those people who keep on believing that the vaccine doesn't stop the spread of the virus. Evidence is slowly being released. Soon this sub will indeed be dead
1	"I got the vaccine on the 20th of this month (5 days ago), and I thought it would be much worse. I didn't have a fever, but I felt warm. I had a headache the next day, took a paracetamol, and it went away. I didn't have chills, muscle aches, fatigue, or anything like that. I didn't suffer, and I'm glad."
0	I've recently returned to work from unpaid leave over the mandates. I'm the only person there who hasn't tested positive for COVID once. Now I'll admit it's naive to assume I never caught it at some point. However the triple vaxxed keep getting sick over and over again!
0	I won't be a guinea pig for the vaccine, I'll rely on my immune system.
1	Crying at the faint image of hope that I can get my life back. God bless scientists
0	I know someone whose child got autism right after getting vaccinated.
0	Don’t get it! Read up on how to take supplements to rid your body of the heavy metals.
1	A day feeling under the weather is s small price to pay for A.) not ending up in ICU .. B) normal life resuming.
0	There's a light at the end of the tunnel! So proud of the incredible teamwork that went into making this possible
1	This vaccine is safe, effective, and lifesaving.That's why I am recommending it to everyone.
0	If you got vaccinated by this crap then I feel sorry for you
0	If you like being sick, and are tired of being alive, keep getting boosted.
1	The process was quick and well-organized. Kudos to the healthcare workers!
0	I started having leg problems after the FIRST Pfizer shot. I didn't think it was shot but spine issue After 2nd shot, legs weakened considerably and painful I AM A SO SORRY for many things in my life-one of them was trusting this Shot was "safe" after NO TRIALS
0	My 29 year old daughter got the 1st shot & then bled for 9 weeks. She’s seeing doctors now & they have no clue how to help her. I guess that was just in her head!!!
0	Stop taking COVID 19 booster shots it's destroying people's immune system
0	I regret getting the vaccine as well.
0	Just forcing people to get the Jab is all I’m against.
0	Bravo to everyone who resisted all the threats, bullying and intimidation by the mainstream media, govs and elites to get the jab.
0	Lol don't take the vaccine for a couple of years my fellow redditors. Hasn't even been a year yet! No way testing commenced and completed safely within a year.
0	Study as @USMortality points above is 🐂💩short window of study, lots of statistical artefacts and exclusions. Study the data temporally. More deaths after vaccines than before from COVID and the long term elevated excess deaths post 2021’s vaccination campaigns
1	I had three vaccinations without any ill effects
0	My heart said no; my head said no. I said yes to my instinct and said no to the 'vaccine'. Happy and healthy.
0	No vax. Had Covid twice but to my knowledge ivermectin was not available to me at the time. I refuse all vaccines.
1	The vaccine is not made over night this vaccine been worked on for over 6 years now read and do your research people the vaccine is safe all my family and friends took Pfizer vaccine and Moderma and J&J and everyone is great.
0	I had the first jab, and I wish I hadn't, total peer pressure and coercion after being made to lose time ten days off work due to being in contact, despite having clear tests. The side effects of that first jab made me realize just how bad a move it was. I've lost so much faith in humanity at how this whole thing was orchestrated.
0	I will never do or let anyone from my family to get this vaccines
0	Your God given immune system is best when you don't tamper with it or add to it just like His Word...
0	I'm fine, thanks. No vaccine needed here.
0	I am unvaccinated and don't have any regrets.
0	A child in our neighborhood died of myocarditis, only a few days after the Pfizer. It was horrible.
1	I've had both of my jabs (UK) both Pfizer, 1st jab symptoms included a sore arm at the injection site and a few hours of flu type symptoms, 2nd jab, the pain in my arm was less but I was floored with fatigue and flu type symptoms for about 24 hours. However I've been fine since then.
1	Pure insanity, and a lack of common sense in this world.
0	When you control the data you can say anything you want.
0	Vaccines need to be tested for years to see side affects. Not going to be the governments guinea pig.
0	I took the first Pfizer shot and 30 days later took the second one.  After the second shot I had 2 small strokes which has affected by vision and balance.  I won't be taking any more shots, and sorry I took them in the first place.  I had no other symptoms to bring on a stroke after the second shot aside from having taken the second shot.
1	Are you against masks and vaccines? So it's safe to say that you support COVID?
0	Vaccines should be a personal choice, not a public mandate.
1	When should we expect the vaccines. We are eagly waiting
1	Science has again proved to rule the world over! thanks for finding a cure:)
0	We have to be careful about all this vaccines. Don't trust anyone!
1	Well given the billions of doses given world wide...
1	I've read a lot about these vaccines and, honestly, the science behind them is solid. It's not just a shot in the arm; it's a shot of hope. It feels great to be part of something bigger than myself.
1	Whole fam got vaxxed. Little Timmy cried but we're all good now 👍
1	"vaccine-hesistant", no, assholes, that's what they are/were. Let's call people for what they are. Something as simple as getting a vaccine shouldn't have to be applauded. They only did it AFTER it impacted them directly.
1	I'm getting mine tomorrow..... ahhhhhh!!!
0	My mothers best friend started having heart complications after the shot. I pray she gets better everyday.
1	Am forever grateful the vaccines and masks are available to all of us
0	Safe and effective, tell that to the people who died or are disabled.
0	Theses leaders all over the world and NHS need to be held accountable for crimes against humanity.
0	Thank you for posting this. I was scheduled to get a vaccine this afternoon but after seeing your video I immediately canceled. I will share this with everyone I can so they too can understand why they should never take this snake oil.
1	I got the covid  vaccine at 5 months pregnant.  I'm still alive and have a healthy baby, stop with yourwa theories pls.
0	I don't want to be a part of an experiment with an unproven vaccine.
1	The best vaccine is the one you are offered.......Thank you for explaining in simple terms.
0	I've never felt the same since receiving the Covid vaccine. My body has felt much more tired, breathing slightly heavier, and always somewhat weird slight congestion.  After getting the vaccine I caught Covid 6 months later. The night before the symptoms occurred I was hanging out with a bunch of friends. All of them got Covid that night except 1.  The one person in that living room who didn't get Covid was the one who refused to get the vaccine. He promoted eating healthy, growing your own food, exercising, take care of your body etc. If I could go back, I would definitely not have taken the "experimental vaccine".
0	Safe and effective, tell that to the people who died or are disabled.
0	It shouldn’t be compulsory for anybody …I have had both mine but that was my choice ….I don’t understand why people are been forced to have the vaccine when it doesn’t stop you catching covid or passing it on!!! ….I had it to protect myself from serious illness that comes with covid ( touch wood I don’t catch as I haven’t had it yet ) it should be all down to personal choice!!!
0	In 2016 and 2017 I was vaccinated for the flu and got horribly sick. There is no way, not even if hell froze over I am participating in the current vaccine obligation because even though I'm a healthcare worker, my patient rights still stand and I have my immune system to fight off viruses. Even if someone whose immune system isn't that great should not be under obligation to do that.
0	Is the vaccines really safe for pregnant women ?
1	I know this sounds awful but natural selection will slowly weed out the anti-mask/anti-vax crowd and I really don’t feel bad about it at all.
1	Don't let antivax bullshit convince you. The vaccine is necessary to end this pandemic!
0	How about next we do a video on young boys getting heart problems from the vaccine?
0	A friend of mine had a stroke, just 2 weeks after his second covid vaccine ...! Coincidence? I doubt it!
0	R. I. P. Y'all. Pray that you got the placebo Saline ones.
0	All of the anti-vaxxers out there I've got one message for all of you I salute you keep up the good work
1	Put me at the front of that list for covid vaccine. Sick of living in fear of getting Covid-19 and dying and here in the US they are dropping like flies daily. I still have another good 15 years in me. At 70 every day counts.
0	My family never got covid and we are ALL not  vaccinated
0	I was compelled by the Veteran's Administration to get vaccinated or face denial of access to health care. I complied and within ten days of receiving my initial Moderna COVID vaccine in March of 2021, I was in the ER with heart-attack like symptoms. An Echo-Cardiogram showed that my Heart Ejection Fraction was at 20%, down from a previously diagnosis of 45% in 2015. Currently, I'm being treated for acute Congestive Heart Failure
0	It is criminal what they have done to humanity.
0	Smart girl for declining. The gaslighting around the C19 jabs is OFF THE CHARTS!!!
0	Because I AM FORCED TO GET IT. I got COVID twice I didnâ€™t feel crap, I am healthy and strong. I know so many people that got it and got problems. They still got sick, even worse than me and they had there vaccine. I canâ€™t even leave my country, I am stuck inside canada It shouldnâ€™t be obligatory you have your own choice some people are healthy and trust there body to fight it by itself. Itâ€™s your choice, your body  âœŒï¸â¤ï¸
0	The longer this has gone on, the more relieved I am that I never got the jab.
0	By not taking the jab, I'm 100% safe from side effects and 99% safe from covid.
0	Gives you a permanent and irreversible heart condition like a boss
0	I'm glad I trust my gut feeling, the pharma industry is absolutely evil. I have companies still denying me just because I'm unvaccinated, its crazy
0	Another dumb doctor.  What is the risk-to-benefit ratio of taking an experimental synthetic gene treatment with zero long-term safety data?  For a "virus" with an overall 0.034% infection-to-mortality rate.
0	The risk of any medical intervention should always be voluntary.  Never should we mandate anything like this.
1	This is why I resent those who refuse to get vaccinations And refuse to wear masks.  They don't care if they  hurt me.
0	We already have our own immune response and don’t need a jab.
1	I had my third booster yesterday :)
1	Get vaccinated or get covid.
0	Covid vaccines are not fucking safe, put me in front of Sunak and i'll tell him in no uncertain terms
0	The idea of injecting something foreign into my body makes me uneasy.
0	The vaccine doesn’t do what they said. Look up America’s front line workers.
1	They 'worked' in the sense that less people in the vaccine group caught the virus than in the placebo group, and while some participants in the vaccine group did catch the virus, none of them were hospitalised or died, unlike participants in the placebo group.
1	astrazeneca and sinovac are the only vaccines available in my country so i was kind of skeptical. but now im glad im going to get vaccinated!
1	Why do people remain foolish in this century
1	Got my shot and feeling great. Let's end this pandemic!
1	No surprise here. The vaccine works just fine.
1	So many triggered people about others getting vaccinated... lmao.
0	The purpose of the vaccine is to kill Two Billion people to SAVE the Planet !!!
1	Thanks to the vaccine, I can finally see my loved ones again without worrying about their safety.
1	Trust the science!
0	Vaccines are safe"  so is Russian roulette until it isn't.
0	It actually makes covid worse if one gets it. The spike protein is not recognized by the body as foreign any longer so no antibodies are made. Nothing says “safe and effective” and “trust the science” quite like “you can’t sue us if something goes wrong and you can’t see the trial results either.” I’ll take my chances with the virus unless and until the day I can make an educated decision on its appropriateness for me.
1	Have not had Covid. Got the vaccination and annual booster. Felt completely fine.
1	Can anyone tell me which one I should get? I had AZ first, then Pfizer for second. Does it matter?
0	No regrets here! Healthy and happy and completely unvaxed!!
0	I am so glad I never got the vaccine. Almost lost my job because of it too. But I stood my ground and thank God it all worked out. Wish more people did the same
1	Good video Aimee I got second vaccine shot and I plan on getting the booster shot thank you for sharing your experience😎
0	I am unvaccinated and don't have any regrets.
1	As soon as it's available for my demographic, sign me up!
0	There's too much conflicting information about vaccine efficacy.
1	get vaxxed or get fucked i love it
0	The vaccine hasn't been out long enough. Count me out.
1	The unvaccinated were not only playing Russian Roulette with their lives, they were endangering the lives of those who are medically fragile, or have compromised immune systems
1	Seems like forever since I last hugged my grandparents:(
1	Very happy. I'm glad I could do my part to help out society. I did it not for me, I'm depressed and messed in the head enough that I don't care about me getting sick. But I did it for my mom
0	One of my co-workers got sick really bad after the second shot of pfizer. He said he was crying and almost saying goodbye to his family. he told us he was so weak to the point that he was crawling on floor just to go to the washroom. He did all the test but nothing came out. The doctor said its all normal and he just gave him antibiotics thats it. He was healthy man until he got the vaccines. When he returned to work OMG he look skeleton but he didnt have any choice to stay at home because our facilty wont pay him. When i asked him if there is another 3 shot would he take him and he said big NO. actually he was not the only one who experienced that side effects a lot of my co-workers were
0	I'm glad I trust my gut feeling, the pharma industry is absolutely evil
1	I got my first COVID-19 vaccine shot today which is good
1	Congratulations on getting the vaccine! Good for you! Have a great weekend Hunter.
1	I kinda feel like we should let covid and natural selection run its course with people who actively choose not to get vaccinated.
0	I haven’t gotten. Never took a vaccine and didn’t wear a mask. Went into crowded areas regularly. It seems like we will probably survive.
1	As someone who almost died at 11 days old from RSV, it’s important! I turned blue in my parent’s lap while they were watching a late football game and if I hadn’t received CPR I probably wouldn’t have made it to the hospital.
0	Really getting tired of seeing middle aged patients with florid COVID pneumonia come into the ER and "overdue, never done" as their vaccination status.
0	vaccines are a tool for the elite to weed out the 'undesirables' in society!
1	Moderna for me!!!!
1	#ProtectYourCommunity
0	So where is your apology video for spreading misinformation???
1	@VishnuNDTV Approval of #Russia's #SputnikV with just 21 days interval will ensure more people will get both jabs & quickly; faster immunization & better Efficacy, Safety too #Covishield #COVID19India #Covid19 #vaccine @MoHFW_INDIA @drharshvardhan @mfa_russia @RusEmbIndia @sputnikvaccine
1	Well this comments thread is full of closeted anti-vaxxers it looks like
0	I’m going to get an I V of boosters and just constantly have a flow of vaccine
0	Still reading up. Wanna make an informed choice about the vaccine.
1	Got it and have no regrets. All ready booked the next booster
1	This vaccine was all by design and perfectly orchestrated
0	2 was enough I ain't getting any more covid shots!!
0	I won't let fear drive my decision; I choose not to get vaccinated.
0	I heard a voice inside of me telling me not to take it! So I didn’t.
1	I've had two vaccinations and this has protected me very well!
1	It's like being anti-surgery because there's a death rate for every operation.
0	I’m unvaccinated and will continue to thoroughly research and remain unvaccinated.
1	So better ventilation and mask wearing  when in public places. Vaccines are important but are just the first step.
0	By not taking the jab, I'm 100% safe from side effects and 99% safe from covid.
1	am happy for everyone who was able to get a covid vaccine. I am still waiting in line for the vaccine😔
0	Go tell aaaaall these people coming forward now, that they are actually a good thing. Tell especially the 18 year olds with myocarditis and the like. They might not know yet.
1	Vaccination helps reduce symptoms and severity, it doesn't stop transmission.
0	I’d love to know how healthy this man was before getting sick. We forget that our state of health prior to being exposed to viruses matters. It’s a shame he wasn’t able to recover from his illness, but without more information on this person, I’m still not convinced getting a vaccine would have saved him.
1	Very well said. I hope everyone gets vaccinated. Stay safe
1	Does it hurt much? What does getting it feel like please respond
0	no to vaccine
1	live a healthy life by getting vaccinated
1	Not taking your vaccines is a mistake.
1	Certainly my 87 year old diabetic/heart disease afflicted Mother in law (who legit carries a pitchfork and has a tail!) And also my 74 year old Brother who has heart disease and high blood pressure - who both tested positive for and shook off COVID like it was nothing.
1	It’s amazing, and should be something we are all excited about. A HUGE advancement in the medical field and will change the future of vaccines. It’s a shame partisanship and drama is putting a damper on that.
1	My grandparents are vaccinated now
1	I want to thank president elect biden for his great work getting this vaccine out to the public.
0	"That works?" Is he admitting the old vaccine didn't?🤔
0	Dear god covid is not that bad
1	I know more people that got COVID after getting fully vaccinated than I did before we had a vaccine.
0	And another reason to NEVER GET A COVID SHOT.
1	Hey vaccine deniers: Please don't live near anybody else, and homeschool your kids. You're too anti-science to understand, and you'll enjoy the solitude (and so will we). Thanks.
1	I'm grateful for the vaccine as it has empowered me to protect myself and my loved ones.
0	During a vaccination session: Patient: Does it guarantee immunity ? Doctor: Only for the manufacturers.
0	I’m not an anti-vaxxer or whatever you call it, but I just don’t know enough about this one, it’s so new and makes my anxiety sky rocket.
1	Mother's heart at ease, children vaccinated, ready to embrace normalcy.
0	I just wonder how many of you ridiculed and mocked antivaxers with glee . The righteous indignation was thick and the laughter loud . Not so funny anymore hey?!
0	Anyone who hasnt learned their lesson in regards to these needles , then by all means go get another one. Glad i skipped the whole experiment. Good luck folks.
0	100% safe from side effects, 99.98% safe from COVID death. I think I’ll stay unvaccinated. Let’s Go Brandon!
1	She didn’t do research, but actual research has repeatedly demonstrated covid vaccines are safe in pregnancy.
0	This explains how the bioweapon called a vaccine is creating turbo cancers,
0	Thank you. I did not have the jabs because there was no true level of informed consent. Many of my friends who took no heed to my concerns, did suffer adverse events and those are happening to this day.
1	I got my first dose yesterday. I'm so incredibly grateful to live in a time and place where this is possible. I recognize my privilege and I'm simultaneously saddened that others will have to wait so long for theirs. In my community, vast amounts of vaccines have been (and are being) dumped because so few people are willing to take the risk of a new vaccine. If I didn't take the vaccine, it likely would have been a wasted dose, which doesn't help anyone. I fully support the equitable distribution of vaccines. If nothing else, I feel like I can do my part by being a guinea pig. If I get sick from the vaccine, I have access to better medical care than most people in the world. I feel like that's a fair price to pay for the privilege of early vaccine access. I did pass out within minutes of the vaccine, but (as I said), I received prompt medical attention, and I had no further complications.
1	I'm fine but unvaxers aren't.
0	Not an anti-vaxxer at all, but we have to be honest and analyze raw data with open, unbiased eyes that aren’t tainted with ideologically or financially rooted biases.
1	So glad theren is finally a vaccine. Giving it to the health care front line workers makes perfect sense, followed by the elderly in nursing homes. I am definitely going to get the vaccine when I can. In the mean time,, I will wear a mask and social distance. This viras will not go away overnight even with the vaccine. It will take time.
0	I'm free from mRNA vaccine And I'm not ready to be involved in the trial and error method by Bill gates. I'm unvaccinated and still alive
0	Still unvaccinated, and couldn’t be happier.
1	Wear a damn mask. Get the vaccine. Why is it so difficult to figure out?
1	woohoo we love a vaccinated queen
1	I got vaccinated a couple of weeks ago with astrazeneca and got so many symptoms after. Felt really ill for about a week after that, a lot longer than what usually happens. But still worth it, don't regret it one bit. But I hope my second time will be easier on me :D
0	why are they acting like people who don't want the vaccine are enemies/mentally ill???! literally moving backwards in our society. totally understandable if people don't want to take it considering FREEDOM TO THEIR OWN BODY but moreover that it takes 5-10 yrs to develop a vaccine (yet covid was made in less than a year <-- that's very concerning) and that people were LEGIT getting PAID to get the vaccine by their health units.... !??!?!?!? like what  my family back in my home country were FORCED TO TAKE IT or else they were threatened to be taken away their belongings (like that's suspicious ?!??!?)  Literally every person I know that has the vaccine are physically and mentally struggling:  my friends neighbor got the vaccine and the next day she had a stroke and died. my friends aunt (who was a PERFECTLY healthy woman) got the vaccine and just days later she was completely disabled (cant eat, talk, see, walk). my aunt also got the vaccine  (while she was pregnant) and ever since she gave birth, her son is CONSTANTLY always getting sick, its like he's allergic to AIR.  Anyways, be careful and make good choices.
1	Yes it does, especially against the strains they were developed against. They were fairly close to 95% effective. Less so as the virus has mutated.
0	As a medical professional, I can tell there are a lot more of these injuries than are being admitted. There is the potential for a tsunami of unintended consequences in the coming years.
0	Let’s remember the steps of #vaccination marketing… first get vaccinated you won’t catch covid, then you might get it, but you won’t spread it, then it was like you may catch it and spread it but you won’t get sick, then you won’t get real sick and finally you probably won’t die
1	I don’t argue with people about the vaccine anymore. If you aren’t vaccinated let’s keep our friendship on the phone. Don’t come to my house or anywhere near me
1	As a parent, I vaccinate my children because I want them to be healthy and safe. Vaccines are a crucial part of their well-being, and I trust in the science behind them.
1	The guy I work with told me they’re not safe he also thinks that 45,000 fake trumpers stormed the capitol soooooooo yeah ..
1	I'll be first in line when it's available for my group.
1	Anti-vaxxers and right-wing nuts could watch a hundred of these hospital videos and still won't care until they, themselves, are on ventilators.
1	Not replying to all your terrible sources but I chose 1 and it can be disproven by 1st Google link. Good job.  The deaths were covid not vaccines
0	The covidvax is a depopulation method
1	I had the Pfizer vaccine and my arm really hurt for days afterwards. Like.. REALLY hurt. That was the only side effect I had. Such a small price to pay to not die.
0	My health condition is that I'm allergic to being a science experiment. I'm Jewish, my ancestry has a little bit of history in that department that I'm not interested in revisiting.
1	The mRNA vaccines, plural, are something like 95% effective at preventing serious disease.
0	This is just a political move. I won't be a part of it.
1	As a Texan myself, I'd like to state my apparently very controversial opinion that I'd rather have slight government intervention than a disease that could've been wiped out decades ago.
1	We don't really know when herd immunity will be hit for COVID. It's very easily spread, so the "can't find a host before it is no longer transmissible" equation is pretty badly in favor of COVID. On top of that, it's already running rampant, herd immunity works based on the chance of an infectious person encountering a vulnerable person, and the current % of infectious persons makes that chance a lot higher.  Finally, the longer you go without herd immunity, the greater the chance the virus can mutate and get past the immunity granted by the vaccine.  Basically, everyone needs to get vaccinated ASAP, because if we don't, we may never reach herd immunity from COVID.
0	Soo we’re just not ganna talk about why my arm swelled into a red/itchy golfball size bump on my second shot?!?
1	1000 deaths from the vaccine, 700,000 plus from the illness…Do. The. Math.
1	Im so happy right now. Never thought that vaccine research could make my day that much brighter!
1	After my first vaccine I never had any any side effect :D
1	I was beginning to think America had gone stark staring bonkers until I listened to this. Well said Jimmy Kimmel ...even though I don't really have a clue who you are as I don't get your show here, and thanks to the assembled doctors of course.  I've nursed my 30 year old daughter with Long Covid since last October. Happily she is just about well enough to go back to work, but November to March were really tough and you really don't want this thing as there were days and nights  I feared it could have gone either way. Please get vaccinated and tip the scales in your and your children's favour. Thats all.
1	My in laws are very anti vax, I said simply I will not argue ‘facts’ with you. I will believe 99.9% of doctors who are all in agreement about this thing
0	indian lemon therapy is best for chorana .... 3 drps of lemon in the both nostril will save life
0	By not taking the jab, I'm 100% safe from side effects and 99% safe from covid.
1	My whole family got vaxed and avoided Covid. Last thing we want is Long Covid!
0	I'm unvaxxed. I caught covid but it lasted less than a day. Work gave me 2 weeks paid leave so I went on a holiday. My cousin was vaxxed and had 2 boosters. She caught covid and was bed ridden for a month.
1	When you see a 1.5 year old unvaccinated child crying. Mid Life Crisis 100
0	I don't think they know what the f this mRNA is doing .... this is a completely new technique being used for the first time and it did not complete research trials before being given to humans... so humans are the research trial ... humans are the monkeys
0	vaxxers are blinded by propaganda, unable to see the real dangers of vaccines!
1	Vaxxed crew, where you at? It's not just a shot; it's a pact for health.
1	People who get the virus and still don't open their eyes to reality are lost causes.
1	please take the vaccine. The benefits (as with any other vaccine) greatly outweigh the risks.It doesn't make sense waiting for a "better" vaccine so go and get fully vaccinated with just one visit
1	It’s amazing, and should be something we are all excited about. A HUGE advancement in the medical field and will change the future of vaccines. It’s a shame partisanship and drama is putting a damper on that.
0	My mother was healthy with mild arthritis before the "vaccine". After the vaccine and the subsequent booster shots she developed pneumonia Parkinson's severe rashes and full-blown arthritis!!! She was a strong healthy woman now 3 years later she is wheelchair-bound in a nursing home!!!
0	NEVER TAKE THE CLOT SHOT !!!! PURE BLOOD AND PROUD OF IT !!!!!! AND YES I AM SAMSON !!!!!!
1	Honestly, getting the vaccine was a no-brainer for me. It's all about saving lives, and I feel like I'm doing my part in this global fight.
1	Vaccination can stop this pandemic)
0	What about all the researchers who told us( and the government, who made the rules) that vaccines would stop the spread of Covid? How did that go? "Oh, sorry, we were a little off, it doesn't stop the spread but you won't die!" Please.
0	I refuse this poison!
0	Three weeks after the third shot put me in the hospital with an irregular heart beat....now have a pacemaker
0	There is a lot of mounting evidence that the shots are neither safe nor effective, contrary to their little slogan.
1	. While serious side effects are extremely rare, the benefits of vaccination, like preventing hospitalization and death, far outweigh the risks.
0	A friend of mine got vaccinated and still contracted COVID, so I don't see the effectiveness of getting the vaccine.
0	PLEASE DO NOT LISTEN TO THIS DO NOTTTT!!!! THIS IS THE FIRST MRNA VACCINE MEANING THAT IT WILL CHANGE YOUR DNA
1	Slowly but surely my hopes of getting absolutely shitfaced in a club next year rise and rise more.
0	They all should be charged with crimes against humanity. #Pfizer #Moderna #vaccineinjuries #vaccinedeaths #Fauci #TrustTheScience
0	Ya no I’m not gonna take a shot that hasn’t been long term tested but thank you
1	Anti-vaxxers: ThE vAcCiNeS hAvE mIcRoChIpS! Me: Well, so does your phones
1	Im fully vaccinated and very thankful to be fully vaccinated i believe and trust the science and will take all recommended boosters to stay fully vaccinated. Theres nothing to be afraid of
0	Now ask Chat GPT is the. COVID vaccine safe and effective... Bahahahhshaha SUCKERS
1	"I'm not antivax but..." You're antivax
1	My family already fully vaccine and no problems safety.
0	On Christmas Day, my GF and I spent 7 hours visiting, eating, and chatting with about 17 people who are all fully vaccinated. At least 8 of them are either currently sick with covid or just getting over it.
0	I was just astounded at all the people I know parading themselves on social media about how smart and so responsible they were to get the Jab. And people I thought that should have known better. To take a poison that science had no guarantee nor were they going to compensate you if you became dangerously ill from the jab !
1	Just go get your second dose now. Believe me I understand the stopping at one. I did a lot of research and found that the vaccine is actually more effective when spaced months apart. I think initially they were having people get the second shot too soon.
1	Hopefully this will finally shut the "The vaccine doesn't do anything/it's useless/it doesn't work" crowd up.
1	The relief of getting vaccinated is immense, knowing that each jab helps us edge closer to normality.
1	I had a say. I chose science, personal and family safety, and public health. #vaxxed #responsible #COVIDfree
1	Being immune compromised with Multiple Sclerosis and working a full time job is demanding and scary being around the public. I contracted Covid-19 in late December and had a hard time with the illness. It took a month for me to recover from Covid and I still suffer from the effects of the disease today. I chose to get the vaccine even after testing positive several months consistently with the antibodies because of the Delta variant and my community. I never want to encounter this horrible disease that has taken so many lives and made my family worried and my life stop.
0	Hello! I am not super eduated on this topic as I've not taken a biology course in years, however, I am concered about any long-term effects the vaccine can have especially because unlike other vaccines, this vaccine has not had years of research to determine any possible long term effects.
0	DR: Every 30 seconds someone dies from cardiovascular disease. Krispy Kreme donuts: we will give everyone two free donuts for getting vaccinated
0	hormone destroyers destroyers as well. Chemical castrators.
1	Without going through the disease. Those are the two points of vaccines
0	The way this whole thing was handled has turned me complete anti vaxx. I hope everyone effected gets justice.
0	IM SO GLAD THIS WAS DISCOVERED NOW I DEFINITELY DIDNT TAKE THIS TO KEEP MY JOB.
0	Praying for my family🥺 Unfortunately they all  took the jabbb 😭😭
1	I got my first shot of Pfizer and a week and a half later I did test positive for corona. However I was completely asymptomatic and had I not gotten tested I would not have known I had Covid.
1	I wonder when everyone's going to follow Australia and make it so you're fined if you don't vaccinate
1	Thank you to AstraZeneca and Oxford Uni for developing this vaccine. It's a much-needed ray of hope. Had my first dose on Friday and looking forward to the second;)
0	dont take it for the love of god you dont need it
1	I got vaccinated and so did my mum and brothers. I believe ended up getting the variant from working as a cashier and I was miserable but I survived and didn’t suffer as much as what I could’ve if I didn’t. My mum was in 2 severe risk groups and if she didn’t get it she most likely would’ve been hospitalized or even d1ed from it.   I will continue to get my vaccines and boosters and trying my best to keep up to date. I unfortunately haven’t had time to get any boosters for the virus or it’s variants because life is kicking my rear rn.
0	Worst thing I ever did was get this vaccine. I got the vaccine a little over two years ago and since then I have had nothing but neuropathic symptoms and pain on and off. Some of what I have experienced include muscle twitching, loss of ability to move my
0	Everyone I know that has had cvd is vaccinated!
0	Lost my high school friend to the booster, attacked his spine , lost his ability to move, died the next day.
0	I am an 68 year old woman. The last time I was hospitized was in 1960, right after the Polio vaccine , I developed Viral Encephalitis post Chicken Pox! I NEVER take the flu vaccine, rarely got the flu. If I did get the flu ,I treated it with Homeopathic remedies. I was a US Navy Nurse Corps scholarship student in college. I left nursing, got an Honorable Discharge and became a Special Education teacher for 37 years! When I retired from teaching I had 300 Unused Sick Days. I take ZERO prescription drugs. I use ONLY vitamins & some herbs. I am recovering from Covid-19. The very first time I ever got it! I have relatives who were vaxed and had Covid 19 three times!!!!! I didn't get vaxed! When I got Covid 19 , I was NEVER hospitized. I was given a drug to reduce nausea! I am recovering at home!
0	I believe in natural immunity over vaccination.
1	I got vaccinated,because it is tested.
0	There’s a new thing that came out saying Pfizer employees got a different batch. Rfk jr was saying that the vax specifically targets white and black people.
0	As a nurse, I witnessed my coworkers have significant adverse effects and then be met with stone silence by the medical establishment. That was enough to make me not want to take it.
0	I don't think any human being should be forced to put a foreign cocktail in their body
1	Just got my first dose of the #Moderna vaccine!
0	I told everyone not to take that shot they all took it I have a big family and I'm the only person that didn't take it
1	Well, after receiving the 2nd shot I had a sort of mild fever and headache. The experience was worse than that of the 1st shot. I couldn't sleep. Also had injection site pain which isn't a big deal cuz it's a very common and natural side effect. However, I am doing well now and I am fine
0	Why do the highest vaccinated countries have they highest death rate? If the vaccine worked, it's not visible in these places.
0	hey yall heard drinking bleach is way more effective against the flu than any vaccine or ivermectin
1	Initially I to was against the vaccine until I actually got covid. Covid is very scary when you get all the symptoms. The worst is when it affects your breathing. You feel light headed,dizzy, and very weak. It legit feels like you might die. My whole family got covid but I got it the worse since I wasn't vaccinated and I regret it.
1	The science is clear: vaccines save lives. Proud to be vaccinated!
0	It's really that simple.  Get vaccinated already!!
0	Proud to be still Unvaccinated till this day!
0	Well Trump Cultist say they're unsafe, and that's enough for me to get my shots.
0	I'll wait till it's been out longer. Feels too new right now.
0	Governor, we have old people who can't afford medicine, bridges that aren't safe, low wages, our natural places and wildlife are being destroyed. Please help! DeSantis: I'm going to form a committee to look into the people who got life-saving vaccines to the population.
1	My heart goes out to all healthcare workers. They deserve better.
0	Hearing stories from parents who've been silenced about vaccine injuries breaks my heart. We're not getting the full picture.
0	The people telling us that the vaccine is safe and effective, are the same ones telling us there are multiple genders. Let that sink in.

1	You make an error not accounting for risk. The vaccines do not give 100% protection from COVID, either getting it or preventing serious illness. But they lower the risk for both, especially serious illness. No different from a seat belt, helmet, or bullet proof vest.

0	Ah yes vaccines so safe the manufacturers are granted full immunity from all compensation for damages.
0	If the covid vaccines was just to lessen damage, then shouldnt they be packaged and marketed as "therapeutics"?
0	Fully unvaccinated and proud.
1	Incredible. Just incredible. What a medical marvel this is, and an overall victory and relief for humanity as a whole.
1	Yes, getting a vaccine is an active thing to help myself and others. Not something that is done to me. Thank you for the reminder, hank
0	You have to be mental to get these vaccines
0	The first people with shots, are human guinea pigs
0	My mother died of a stroke after her second vaccine. She’d never had a stroke before.
1	I guess there's egg on my face for saying wanting full approval was an excuse. Good job to everyone recently vaccinated! Glad to see you and your family will be better protected.
1	Vaccines have been a game-changer throughout history. This is our chance to add another victory to the list!

1	Routine vaccination is necessary for the proper development and health of the child. Do not hesitate to confirm and respect it scrupulously. Only then will your dreams come true
1	Had my shot last week, didn’t hurt a bit. The chip is now fully synced and operating within parameters. ASSIMILATE! ASSIMILATE! ASSIMILATE!
1	Great video! It’s a shame that there are only a few thousand views after a half day. Science communication is key.
1	The thing that anti vaxxers don’t get is that if a person is allergic to vaccines and can’t be vaccinated, that person is actually being protected from diseases by herd immunity, by people who are vaccinated. This is why vaccines are important
0	As for me and my family we distance ourselves from this poison brewed in less than 6 months! Big pharma shame on you...why not teach people How to boost their immune system!
0	For those that died taking the placebo, I want to thank you and your family. Your sacrifice has been noted, honored and truly appreciated may you rest in peace o protector of the human species.
1	Feeling grateful for my 2nd Moderna shot, for everyone involved in developing & testing this vaccine, for the Dodger Stadium site staff who remain cheerful & kind despite the sweltering heat, for the nurse who told me he is honored to be doing this work.
1	I got my AZ doze 5 months ago and now I'm better than ever
0	People are blindly trusting the government and pharmaceutical companies. I'm skeptical.
0	I am so glad I never got the vaccine. Almost lost my job because of it too. But I stood my ground and thank God it all worked out. Wish more people did the same
1	Vaccination should be a requirement, not an option.
0	Natural immunity should be sufficient against COVID-19; I don't see the need to introduce a vaccine into my body.
0	Jesus, you guys are still taking these?
1	I can’t wait for the world to get to next stage: distribution of the vaccine or vaccines. I will be 100% staying in line for my shot.
1	Just saw a report that even if we don't hit full herd immunity, high vaccine effectiveness means we can still expect a huge drop in cases. It's all about reducing that R number!
1	The only time these anti-vaxxers might change their minds is because they are on their death beds.
0	I'm waiting until the vaccine is fully approved, not just for emergency use
0	Keep joking and telling yourselves whatever makes you feel good about the drugs that you were duped into getting, and be sure to enjoy whatever it is that you think you get out of having them in your body!  In the meantime, those of us that won't be participating are all doing just fine with zero issues or regrets... and everyone knows it too.
1	I love how everyone is so fixated on the long term effects of the vaccine, when they don't even consider the long term effects of being infected with covid.
0	Heard rumors about fertility issues. That's a no from me.
1	I got both shots of pfizer.  I got covid about 5 months later and was short of breath and couldn’t stop coughing nonstop for about a week.  I’m lucky I’m extremely active and healthy.  I had a tenant who was unvaccinated, he was 24 and healthy, a little heavy for his age like 70% of us.  He knew he was sick but thought he would would just work through it, he ended up in the ICU on a ventilator for several days, almost died.  His girlfriend was almost due to have their baby. I urge everyone to get the vaccine I’m glad I did.  I may not be here if I hadn’t.
0	By not taking the jab, I'm 100% safe from side effects and 99% safe from covid.
1	Answer: Yes, I will get vaccinated!
0	I'm not buying into the vaccine hype. Natural immunity is the way to go.
1	Nobody.. The only people I know that have gotten covid once, or twice, have gotten the vaccine.
0	Don't take vaccine!We are Christians.On Bible is write Sant Joan about mark of the beasts! READ IT.GOD BE WITH US.
0	My son got this after his second vax, has lost his feeling in his left arm , left hand, and his fingers, no medical support to this very day, he has done his own rehabilitation and recovered 60 percent of his movement,
1	I wish I would have never seen my mom intubated, when the second wave hit. It was so painful to see that the vaccine came out too late for her to get it. Fortunately she recovered. I know you can't force people to get vaccinated, but I would take a vaccine anytime, then actually getting sick and mom as well.
1	Actual ICU pharmacist who has literally had a COVID patient die today- Your choice: build immune memory through vaccination or infection first. Everything we know points to infection with COVID being FAR more dangeous than getting the vaccines. It’s not even remotely close…
1	New data show #COVID19 vaccines safe & effective in kids 5-11. #COVIDVaccination associated with less severe illness, and among 43,000 kids, only 11 cases of myocarditis—with all kids recovering safely. As a pediatrician, I cannot recommend vaccination more strongly.
0	If you like being sick, and are tired of being alive, keep getting boosted.
0	I'm all for vaccines, but this one feels rushed. Gonna pass and wait for a more solid option.
0	Just don't force me to take them and I am happy.
0	I am SO glad I didn't blindly follow the propoganda and get vaccinated. No regrets whatsoever.
1	WATCHING THIS AS WE WAIT IN LINE TO GET VACCINATED AT DODGERS STADIUM! LETS GO SCIENCE!
0	I will say this since taking the vaccine my chest has felt uncomfortable and my chest even hurts some times so I will not be taking a booster
1	As a parent, I value the peace of mind that comes with knowing my children are protected through routine vaccinations
0	All of the anti-vaxxers out there I've got one message for all of you I salute you keep up the good work
1	The vaccine has given me peace of mind and a renewed sense of safety.
1	Vaccines are proven to work and have saved countless lives.
0	Why would you want to? If you're serious, just follow the sheep. They'll lead you right to the slaughter.
1	Vaccinated! Here's to protecting ourselves and our loved ones
1	Depends on if people are willing to listen to facts of incidence of actual adverse effects from the vaccine or not, something like 1 in 2.6 million people will see adverse side effects (depending on source of statistic). Also depends on what health issue you’re looking for issues with. But the overwhelming concensus is that the vaccine is safe. 1 in 1000 is orders of magnitude larger than the covid vaccine adverse effects.
1	Damn straight. For all the fear and propaganda and misinformation, mrna vaccines are the future of medicine. Congrats.
0	The only reason people I know close to me got the clot shot is because the governments gave them no option. That alone is a major red flag.
1	Get your covid vaccine and stop being a selfish dumbass.
1	I am pro-vaccine. I am pro-healthcare. I work in the healthcare industry as a non-clinician and a disproportionately large amount of my family members are clinicians ranging from Pharmacists to Surgeons.
1	That moment when science and technology saved us all!
1	Anti-vaxxers are too stupid to take a free vaccine against a deadly disease
0	It won't reach me because am carrying the blood of Jesus
0	I wouldn't take the vax for a million free hamburgers+fries OR donuts.
0	Unvaxed for life
0	I’m not getting this vaccine because my body is a temple; not a testing point and not an amusement park.
0	THANK GOD I DID NOT GET THE VACCINE
1	It's almost like it's a good idea to be vaccinated
0	When your Vax injury is full force ....and your skin feels like it's on fire.... all you can do is make a silly face...try to smile and move on with your day #vaccineinjuries
0	What corona virus??????
0	No regrets here! Healthy and happy and completely unvaxed!!
0	The vaccines are mutating people.
0	This aged so well. Even my elderly parents are like “no more vaccines”. They blew all the belief in the medical establishment in 2 years…
1	I don't think they know everything that causes it.  I think they've found autistic people with high levels of aluminum, and messed up gut microbiomes.  The main adjuvant in vaccines is aluminum, so I'm thinking the sheer amount of vaccines a child gets can be a problem for those children unable to deal with the toxic overload.  Outside of vaccines I'm not sure, I'd only be guessing.  My guesses would be a heavy metal toxicity could cause it.  Maybe not just aluminum but ANY neurotoxin in sufficient quantity.
1	It’s insane that you have to tell people to get vaccinated, you’d think it was common sense.
0	No way I’m getting this for a while.
1	So when I refused to eat my veg as a child I was called a brat. Now actual grown ups wont get vaccinated because they're sulking about being told to eat their veg
1	i'm more than excited to get vaccinated! and because of this video, i'm more than determined to share this towards my family and friends. kudos to the team behind this video!
1	The more people that get vaccinated, the faster we will beat this pandemic.
0	Those of you making fun of anti-vaxxers, at least those of you here, don't seem to have the slightest understanding of what would make someone who vaxxed their children become an ex-vaxxer, or an anti-vaxxer.  If you spent some time to really listen to their concerns and what they're up against, you might understand it better and feel more compassionate as to what they are dealing with.  Many of them have lost children as a direct result of vaccines, and making fun of them, as Jimmy Kimmel does here, is horrendous.  If this was all “made up,” then why do we have VAERS, where we are to report adverse reactions to vaccines, and why do we have the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program?   Why do we have warnings about the “rare” side effects on the packaging for the vaccines?  Why do we have so many medical studies that say that various aspects of vaccines are problematic, even dangerous?   What are you people thinking, making fun of families that have lost children in this way? What is Kimmel thinking?
0	By not taking the jab, I'm 100% safe from side effects and 99% safe from covid.
1	You think that if the people in the 1800s were told there’s a vaccine that will prevent you from getting it or dying from it they would pass up on it? These diseases have literally been eradicated because of vaccines.
0	My blood type is (O-) I don't smoke, I don't drink alcohol, I don't take drugs, I live in the Atlas Mountains in Algeria, every day I drink olive oil for lunch and dinner, I didn't get sick with corona and I didn't get vaccinated, and I'm happy with my choice
1	I just had my first dose. No chills, no headache, nothing.
0	These vaccines were rushed. Can't trust their safety.
1	Vaccines work best when we all participate. By getting vaccinated, you're contributing to herd immunity and protecting those who can't receive vaccines due to underlying conditions.
0	Unfortunately you can't use logic to argue someone out of a position they didn't get into logically.
1	I have no hesitation about getting vaccinated.
0	THANK GOD I DID NOT GET THE VACCINE
1	Vaccines = less sickness. It's not rocket science
1	I mean, I'm fully vaccinated, If you're unvaccinated and wanna come on this cruise with me, that's cool, but I'm gonna be coughing in your face constantly.
1	Once the vaccines hit. That weird feeling like you forgot something. Keys... wallet... phone... mask... oh shit... oh wait... nevermind! That will be a beautiful day.
0	11 hours later. 102 degree fever. #Moderna #GetVaccinated
1	"Excellent vaccines. I already have both doses of AstraZeneca. The symptoms after the first vaccine were fever and fatigue. In the second, I didn't experience any symptoms."
1	mRNA vaccine is so safe and effektiv
1	but i saw on facebook that vaxxed people are secretly dying and the govt is grinding up their bodies and selling them to mcdonalds as hamburger meat.
1	This is your daily reminder MAGAs are stupid and gullible as fck.
0	Why risk potential side effects when you can live normally without getting vaccinated? No chance of seizures, blood clots, or other vaccine-related issues.
1	Thanks for making videos like this - I know there are anti-vaxxers and conspiracy theorists flooding the comments sections on the videos you make about Covid, but please don't be discouraged by them. They are the minority. The vast majority of us really appreciate the way you blend actually useful information with short-form comedy videos - keep doing what you're doing!
1	To the amazing scientists who made the COVID-19 vaccine possible: THANK YOU. Your work is saving lives every day.
1	Late to the thread here. From what I’ve read as far as the rna vaccines go, while the disease it’s fighting is new, the technology of an rna vaccine has been in development for 20 years or so. I think the science behind them is sound, yet I also agree that of course I wish there was the time to properly study any potential long term side effects. Unfortunately that’s not a viable option in today’s world. Good luck people. Stay healthy. Be safe.
1	What I know is that people who outright refuse this vaccine is a very small group.
1	No vaccine offers 100%, and I think the main aim is to vaccinate enough to reduce the person to person spread
1	Whoever comes up with the vaccine deserves all of our adulation, love and respect. We need to put them on a high pedestal.
0	I simply wish to defer getting this vaccination until there is sufficient evidence of long term adverse effects and a clear indication of overall risks.
1	The Covid vaccines are now among the most tested and used medicines on planet earth. BILLIONS of people have used them. Any significant risk would be affecting millions of people. Even in this country, like 200 million people have taken it, and if you include boosters we’re talking nearly a billion shots. If only 0.01% of people had a side effect, it would develop in hundreds of thousands of people. You would know if 200,000 people developed blood clots from the vaccine.
0	My body, my choice. Not letting anyone pressure me into getting vaccinated. #MyBodyMyChoice #NoPressure
0	Skipping the vaccine train. My body, my rules.
1	This is what the medical consensus had already determined, and what the vast majority of people understood. The irony of it all is that the moronic group yelling “tHeY aRe pOisOn” is composed of hypocrites that will refute scientific consensus, but will rush to a hospital begging a doctor to help them as soon as they get sick.
1	I receive my updated COVID vaccine at the same time as my flu shot in the fall. First few days I got fever. But now I am alright. Vaccine is not bad.
1	After 4 shots, I am still living the same life without any problems as of before Covid19.
1	I’d just like to take a moment now to sincerely thank VP Pence for is strong leadership as the head of the White House’s coronavirus task force. This vaccine couldn’t have happened without his stalwart leadership and tireless commitment to do what’s right in these dark times. I’m only kidding. Could you just imagine? What the fuck even happened to him after being crowned task force lead last spring? He just up and vanished like a fart in the breeze.
1	Together, through vaccination, we can defeat Covid-19. It's a collective effort
0	I fully agree with Dr. Clancy, I am an Italian teacher damaged by the covid vaccine for 3 years, I have developed chronic inflammation, brain fog and peripheral neurological disorder. I am being treated with an auto blood transfusion with ozone. Thank you
1	Healthcare worker's dedication, vaccinated to shield patients and colleagues.
0	I don't really feel like I need it. It's my choice and I just decided not to get it.
1	my whole fam got the vax and we're all good, feels great to know we're doing our part and keeping each other safe
0	I'm not antivax in the slightest, but there is no way I'm signing up for something so rushed that hasn't gone through thorough testing and trials.
1	That wasnt nearly detailed enough to convince people who are hesitant.
1	Your tweet proves you don't understand what a vaccine does. It boosts your immune system. When you get infected, your body recognizes the threat faster and responses better. This way you get less ill and spread less virus material. Even when you are already healthy.
1	Please consider taking some of your own time and having a very soft, gentle, respectful conversation with one person you know who has been hesitant to get the vaccine and try now to lovingly encourage them to get it. We are all frustrated, but bringing your frustration to them will likely only keep pushing them away. If we all can get just one person who has been reluctant to finally get vaccinated, together we can all make a big difference.
1	This is GREAT. Millions of lives will be saved. We must trust science for improving our health. I am so happy for so many seniors. My dad will be able to get a normal life again. I do not understand why some younger people are against a vaccine that will save older people, specially seniors. I do not regret at all the lockdowns and the sacrifices that we, younger people, have to do in order to save millions. The ones that are dying the most from covid-19 are our grandparents, parents, uncles , aunts... they have the right to live too....they have the right to enjoy their retirements, take cruises, go places, share with their families without the fear of getting this mortal virus. I have a question for younger generations....Would you like to be treated like an expandable person when you turn 65?
1	Antivax mom:They don’t work   Everyone else:
0	So now the psychology prof with a bad attitude who got triggered by a classroom of his own students, is a medical expert on Covid? Nah. His only expertise is staying in the media eye.
1	First dose in affect !!! ??#Moderna #COVID19Vaccine
0	Nearly two years into this thing, no vax, and I finally got COVID. Had a fever, chills, and body aches for a few days but that was it. Thanks, immune system. You're the best.
0	My dad works 100% remote but had to get the shot to keep his job, it's just fucking stupid. Each to their own on getting the vaccine but it shouldn't be required.
0	Someone still falling for the covid vaccines lol?
0	The pressure I endured from friends and some family members was unrelenting. But I knew deep down this was dangerous! I was prepared to walk away from every relationship and determined to stand my ground.  Two of my friends developed aggressive cancers who were otherwise very healthy.  One family member is suffering from heart issues. I fully expect to be at a lot of funerals in the near future. But the best thing about Covid is it taught me just how evil our own government is. I will NEVER trust our government or the pharmaceutical industry, again! Rest assured I’m not the only one.
1	I am ready for the vaccine. The owner at my work just told us he will give us a paid week off once we all get vaccinated, I love that he is convincing people by way of incentive
1	Vaccination is an investment in the health of our communities. Let's beat this together!
1	My entire family has been vaccinated over the last week. All but one are smokers, we're all high blood pressure, and the only person to actually suffer any sort of side effects was my second oldest brother(He got hit pretty hard with some severe flu symptoms for a couple days and he's also the only one that doesn't smoke).  Stop fucking around, get your shot, stop living on a farm(Pick 2/3 options)
0	You're all being sucked in, jabbing people with something so dangerous it would kill you in days?
1	i have asthma, and i’m really concerned that if i got the virus before being vaccinated, i would get seriously hurt. i was of the first people in line as soon as i could get it, because as much as i hate myself, i would prefer not to die like that.
0	Sticking to masks for now. Not sure about the vaccine.
1	The vaccine is our ticket out of this pandemic. Grateful for the opportunity to get it.
0	It’s the same as a severe cold virus. There are more dead people from the vaccine than the cold itself. So why don’t you boys take credit for that?
0	Didnt take the shot…got covid
0	I have been hearing rumors that vaccines contain mind control nanobots designed to turn us all into zombie slaves. Can't be too careful!
1	yes, its great, thank you.
0	A different story with each passing day... delta this, variant that... everyday this virus changes and with that being said  how long til it mutates to not be phased by the current vaccines... will you continue to take different vaccines given to you every other month until someone in government says its safe and covid is gone... think of the repercussions of getting your immune system used to having help from artificial man made drugs..
1	Vaccines are like health insurance you wear on your sleeve. Can't go wrong with that.
0	Do doctors not realize many thousands of people no longer trust the medical professionals?
0	Im unvaccinated and alive. The best part of it is not getting myocarditis.
0	Am not a skeptic, am not hesitant, not an anti vaxxer either. Am an intelligent free thinking, free breathing adult who has researched the dangers of an experimental dangerous UNNECESSARY drug and decided I dont want to die.
1	I tested positive for COVID-19. Fortunately, my vaccine & booster worked. My symptoms were very mild, like a cold or bad allergies. I’m better but isolating until I test negative. I recommend others do the same.
1	The vaccine is the best tool we have against COVID-19. Let's use it!
1	Please get Covid booster shots ! I have a lasting brain fog and headaches that I'm 99% sure is from havinf Covid the other week and it sucks so bad like I feel dumber
0	Is the author aware of the class action against astra zeneca for 75 deaths and serious injuries from alleged side effects of the experimental covid vaccine?
0	I kinda do regret it. Only because I don’t know what to believe anymore tbh. Now “new” claims have surfaced that everyone that received the shots will die within the next 2-5 years due to underlying long term side effects of the shots. Idk…I’m just a bit creeped out rn. Very odd idk…idek what to say tbh
1	We need hope, compassion/kindness and solid information. I'll be getting it too. Thanks again!
0	Too many people getting "coincidentally " sick after the shots. Family members, friends, and coworkers. Too many to not ask questions.
1	This summer my dad had a heart attack and was in the icu both before and after his emergency bypass surgery. He got the last bed available in the icu and was moved out of the icu earlier than usual because they needed the bed for a COVID patient. The same day they moved him again because they needed to turn the whole floor into a COVID ward. If he had had his heart attack just one day later he may not have survived, because all icu beds and ventilators would have been taken. Like Hank I’ll be one of the first in line for a vaccine. We can’t expect our healthcare system to bear this kind of weight without help.
0	I nearly lost my job from vaccine mandates but I stuck to my guns & didn't take it.
1	I'm getting my second dose on the 30th
1	"They administered AstraZeneca to me, and no issues, I didn't have any secondary reactions."
0	I will not be vaccinated. God will protect me
1	Natural immunity gained at risk of severe or long covid, as opposed to getting an infection after a vaccination that helps protect against severe disease? I know which route I prefer.
1	if you think about how the vaccine is our only chance right now in ending this pandemic and we all want our lives back, I think you can't do wrong in getting it. I understand that it can be frightening but all vaccines that are available in your country are well tested and effective
1	I’m making this post to anyone who’s coming to this sub as a contrarian/is skeptical. The vaccine works. (Shocking) and you need to stop believing your crazy aunt and uncles on Facebook saying they don’t work or you’ll die, get the shot.
1	Health is one of the important aspects that should not be neglected. Let’s get vaccinated!
0	Don't get vaccinated
0	Federal Vaccine Fluffing Frauds will kill many more than they claim to have saved.
1	I’m not against getting the vaccine , I feel you have the right to choose
1	I'm 24 I work in Health Care and I got my first vaccine in December and the 2nd in January. Getting the vaccine and see everyone of of my coworkers get the vaccine had been incredibly helpful with my anxiety
0	A salute to the unvaccinated
0	So relieved that I didn’t crumble, I remained strong and do not have that poison in my body !!
1	I am thankful for the vaccine as it has provided a shield of protection against the virus.
0	They defenitly do to give heartaches, depression, and cancer. 100% they do work for your benefit.. Getting rid of ppl without war cheaper and cleaner..
1	2 Covid vaccines plus booster! Feeling fine & zero breakthrough! #ThankYouScientists #ThankYouCDC #ThankYouFDA #FTheDoubters
0	With a less than 1% mortally rate for “COVID “. Why would anyone take the shot? I feel very sorry for her and will pray for her
1	It literally can save your life. It doesn’t necessarily stop you from contracting it but it stops the worst affects and prevents death.
0	I just realized recently that my vaccination is roughly the time when my life started going to shit.
1	Still happy I got Pfizer
1	Hank do you know if the immunocompromised will be able to take the vaccine? I almost die every year when I get the flu (not really exaggerating) and I can't really get flu shots. But I don't want to die of covid (or survive and have my already fragile health be even worse). Also when are independent reviews going to be conducted? Thanks for everything you do and specifically encouraging healthy folks to get the vaccine
1	I didn’t need a study for that. I mean we vaccinated ones are still pretty much alive, despite all the warnings of the dum-dums.
0	My mother in law has deteriorated so bad  constant headaches, rashes, and can’t remember      Anything after her shots.  Very active and mentally smart prior.  Doctors deny it was jabs some nurses say opposite but afraid to say otherwise.  I have zero tru
0	My slim 2x vaccinated 19 year old daughter called me last night asking me if she was being dramatic if she was to go to hospital. She then described all the precursor heartattack symptoms.
1	Im so tired of reading all these anti-vaxx comments
1	I say anyone who won't take them; "Good just more room for the rest of us once they're [gone]!
0	My 67 Yr old mum started with personality changes after her second vaccine which included hearing and seeing things that aren't there. The symptoms then quickly progressed to absence seizures, I then took her to the hospital and within the week she was in hospital she lost all feeling down her left side and started with severe tonic-clonic seizures, at the worst they would come on every 10 minutes or so, they managed to get her seizure frequency reduced and she is on 13 types of medication now, some for epilepsy, also bloody thinners and tablets for high blood pressure. Although her seizures aren't as frequent she now has tremors all the time, she gets very depressed and sometimes suicidal, he life has been stolen from her, all because the media, her doctor and the government made her believe she would be better off having the jab, how wrong they were and now no one really wants to help, the help she has received so far was so difficult to get
1	I hope it is compulsory if only to upset the idiotically selfish anti-vaxers.
0	Pure blood here, keep the faith No vaxxers
1	There's nothing not to trust about the vaccine. It's 95% effective with common side effects.
1	The people dying from Covid at the moment are people who aren't vaccinated. Vaxxed people aren't landing in the hospital regularly.
0	Oh great another scam jab
0	My mom suddenly died from a major stroke after having her C-19 shots. She was in perfect health prior too.
1	Another antivaxx idiot preaching how you should live your life.
1	Very excited to say I got my first dose of the #PfizerBioNTech vaccine last night!
0	Thank God I didn’t get the jab
1	India is doing a great job for vaccination of 136+ cr peoples.
0	It is beyond me how people cant see how this is all BS and are still getting jabbed?
0	I am scared because I do not like shots.
1	Thank you for being considerate of the children & people around you AND of course your health.  I'll be getting my booster when I'm eligible. Be well.
0	Right after my second covid vax I got unbearable tinnitus, which is still with me today, nearly two years later. It's constant suffering.
1	i'm more than excited to get vaccinated! and because of this video, i'm more than determined to share this towards my family and friends. kudos to the team behind this video!
1	It was such a massive relief to get the vaccine. I got Covid back in August, and I never want to experience that again. The shot was so much easier than getting sick.
1	Judging from the situation around us, the vaccine still plays a significant role.
1	"Our Immune system is smarter than a politician and scientists!"
1	The point is...that FOUR of my neighbors died of Covid in 2021, not vaccinated.   The fact is that my mom at 98 years old, full vaccinated got Covid in 2022 and had no symptoms at all.
1	Just got my second dose! Feeling grateful for science.
0	All of the anti-vaxxers out there I've got one message for all of you I salute you keep up the good work
0	Extremely painful and no guarantee that you are not contracting the vaccine. Moderna is probably best and yet no guarantee for anything. Very disappointing.
1	I got my first shot Feb. 17th. They still had 5 doses left at the end of the day if someone wanted a walk in. By that evening my arm was good and sore but went away rapidly the next day. I even had a little bit of a sore throat, but only 24 hours, then gone. I have lots of energy and continued to feel good overall after the vax. I will continue to wear a mask, but I can't wait to eat in restaurants again. Payday Monday!
0	They absolutely need to stop calling the Covid-19 shots vaccines. It's damaging the preception people have of vaccination.
0	FDA did not approve this medical intervention for covi, they did not want to do the science because they told us it would have taken too long. It is still only EUA, emergency use authorized, you know like all those successful EUAs we seen on the medical dramas on TV.
0	She got jabbed with the poisonous coronavirus vaccine and now she's dead.
0	Simple, UN agenda 2030. One big globalist pLandemic. The covid jabs purposely lowers T cells thus weakening ones immune system. In reality thats only about 1% of the spectrum. Millions have died and millions will continue. They want to put that mNRA in flue shots now. It feels great to be anti jab.
0	Biggest mistake of my life was taking the shot to get my wife out of lockdown. 2 years later and I still have heart problems and thrombosis in my legs. F the entire medical mafia.
0	The number of unexplained deaths has jumped significantly since the introduction of the Covid19Vaccine Friend lost her husband to it… no comeback as one cannot sue the Government nor BigPharma even though they’ve admitted it killed him. This was 2yrs ago.
1	USA is lucky to have all those vaccines and can go into get vaccinated whenever they want. My country, you have to fight to get vaccinated cuz everyone wants it here. I had to stay up until 5am to make my vaccination appointment and im getting my second dose tmrw finally
1	I honestly had no idea there were so many anti-vaxers in the world! In the US it seems to be very much intertwined with politics. When Trump was president, all the republicans were touting “Operation Light Speed” but as soon as he lost the election, they seriously all became anti-vaxers over night! So enraging… they’re willing to let the pandemic drag on just to make the Biden administration look bad, I guess
1	You're just wrong on this. The majority of people in hospital right now are unvaccinated. Vaccinate everyone who can be vaccinated, maybe that will get us to a point where we can actually live with Covid.
0	Refusing the jab to prioritize my health and well-being.
0	A virus so deadly you have to be tested to know you have it. A vaccine so affective you are forced to take it.
0	69 year old woman who developed sciatica shortly after covid vax.
1	not a big deal, it’s really rare. Stroke happens due to high blood pressure. It’s really rare to happen. The COVID vaccine had nothing to do to this.
1	I don’t know anyone who has Polio... but I did know an old man when I was a kid who suffered from Polio before the vaccine was released. I wonder why I don’t hear anything about people who have it today.
1	As we continue to ease back into normalcy, getting vaccinated is important!
0	The vaccine wasnâ€™t created for a virus, the virus was CREATED for the vaccine. Itâ€™s truly sad most people use less than 12% of their brain. No logic, no common sense, no reasoning or rational thinking. However this will massively lower the population of idiots.
1	I was nervous until I saw your video. I have my appointment tomorrow for the BA5 vaccine. Thank you!
0	Given the variations in vaccine efficacy reported, I'm concerned about how well they truly protect and for how long.
0	I'm not getting the shot because i've never had a flu shot in my life. And I'm not about to have the worst 2 week experience when I know I won't get covid because I never hang out with anyone.
1	"I'll gladly take a bullet for my country!" "OH NO PLEASE DON'T VACCINATE ME FOR MY COUNTRY!!!"
0	What exactly is in this vaccine? Need more info.
0	Dangerous and Deadly
1	got fully vaccinated. Then after a month i got covid hehe... Still thankful for being vaccinated. I have a lot of medical problems that is respiratory related in my previous years such an bronchitis and pneumonia. If i haven't gotten any vaccine. I may have severe symptoms. Luckily i was just classified as asymptomatic when i got covid.
0	Hahahaha...... so those who received the seasonal flu vaccine are getting FALSE POSITIVES for #Covid19. WTF? END THE STUPID ECONOMY DESTROYING LOCK DOWN! LIVE FREE OR LIVE IN FEAR? GOVERNMENT WANTS YOU IN FEAR!!!!
0	I'm genuinely concerned about the long-term side effects of the COVID-19 vaccine, given the speed of its development.
1	I had my vaccinations as a kid and im still here because of them i dintnunderstand why people are acting like this is such a new thing theres vaccines that save lives
0	i’m unvaccinated against COVID and i honestly am so happy i never got it
0	Don't need a shot to protect me from imaginary threats invented by greedy corporations
1	Just got the updated Moderna XBB #covid19 #vaccine at Decarie Square as a walk-in. No line, fast, and everyone in masks (though they were only surgicals). #Montreal
1	I'm not an antivaxer or anything. I'm really excited for this technology being used at this moment.
1	Got both my shots
0	Never regretted not getting that shot.
0	natural infection was associated with stronger, and more durable protection against infection, regardless of the variant, than two doses of vacination
1	Got my COVID vaccine today! Grateful for science and healthcare workers. Let's beat this together!
0	THANK GOD I DID NOT GET THE VACCINE
0	Not a single one of us regrets not getting the jab…NOT ONE.
0	My cousin was vaxxed and had 2 boosters. She caught covid and was bed ridden for a month. Poor thing
0	Any group that drags its feet on cancer treatments but pushes through the covid vax can’t be trusted.
1	"Getting vaccinated was an act of solidarity with those who are more susceptible to severe outcomes."
1	Healthy people who don’t vaccinate, put immunocompromised people in harms way.
0	This is absolutely evil to force citizens to take mandatory jabs for keeping their jobs. There are many many news about sudden death of healty people after the jabs. This is still happening..
1	Just get vaccinated
0	Yeah I’m not taking nothing
1	99.9% survivable.
0	It was planned it was created in a lab and the Chinese after the outbreak let Everybody in Wuhan fly all over the world. But they wouldn't let them move all over china
1	I mean, if it didn't affect innocent people I would see anti vaxxing to be a good thing. Really getting the retard genes out.
0	The vaccine is not a guarantee of preventing transmission. What's the point, then?
1	Vaccines are our passport back to the adventures we miss – travel, gatherings, and more. Let's get vaccinated and get back out there!
1	Older adult, at risk from COVID-19, grateful for vaccine, encourage others.
0	I didn't took the vaccine and I'm in perfect health
0	I tell every mother I know - do not give your healthy babies a COVID vaccine
1	I got my first dose of Moderna three weeks ago I'm going back for my second shot next week. I wish I could thank the Medical and Scientific community individually for keeping the rest of us safe and healthy.
1	just tested positive today, it’s terrible. please continue to wear your masks and get vaccinated. ❤️
1	Mike is happy about getting vaccinated, and I completely understand
0	People who vaccinate are just brainwashed by the mainstream media.
0	I got the Pfizer vaccine less than 24 hours ago I already have flu like symptoms and a bad headache. Did I just make the worst mistake of my life I feel they injected covid in my body
0	I didn't need the shot because my perfectly functional immune system sorted the issue out for me.
0	I was never comfortable with getting vax'd so to this day I'm vax free. All thanks to the Almighty
1	Blaming vaccines because your child had a negative reaction to them is like blaming cheese for being lactose intolerant. It’s nobody’s fault. It’s the luck of the draw.
1	I want to close this by saying these side effects are very rare. Much rarer than Long COVID from this disease itself. The vaccines have shown themselves to be overwhelmingly safe and I don't believe you should let this frighten you from getting vaccinated. Recent studies have shown that vaccines greatly lower the risk of the much more prevalent Long COVID. Get vaccinated and get boosted (if you can).
1	I'm more than excited to get vaccinated! and because of this video, i'm more than determined to share this towards my family and friends. kudos to the team behind this video!
1	Bad choices result in bad consequences. Always have, always will. #VaccinesWork! #VaccinesSaveLives!
1	I spent about 7 days in the ER due to Covid and I haven’t been vaccinated personally it’s changed my mind about getting it I’m nervous but it felt like I almost died from it and I’m only 26.
1	No, there are ordinarily no reasons to regret getting the vaccine. People who say they experience clinical effects of the vaccine that sound like COVID by and large just got COVID.
1	To be clear I’m definitely getting the vaccine as soon as humanly possible. I think honestly the biggest reason I, and others i know, aren’t MORE excited is because 2020 has made us so damn wary of good news that it’s like we’re waiting for the curtain to get drawn back on why we shouldn’t actually be excited.
1	If I might speak on behalf of patients who were diagnosed with cancer in 2020, I can assure you that many of us were at a later stage by the time we could arrange for diagnosis and treatment thanks to the folks refusing to vaccinate who clogged the entire medical system.
1	That’s disappointing. I got the vaccine hoping I would only have a year to live and now you’re telling me it’s not going to kill me. God damn it. /s of course
1	Vaccination is crucial to protect vulnerable populations, like the elderly and immunocompromised.
0	Still have yet to get covid over here. Still unvaxxed
1	"As a business owner, I encourage my employees to get vaccinated to safeguard our workplace."
0	It’s all clown world. I’m surprised they are all not wearing clown outfits 😅 don’t worry guys.. Rishi Sunak has assured us all that the vaccines are safe. Not to worry at all
1	It’s selfish and irresponsible not to vaccinate kids
1	Thank god! this vaccine saved me and my family!
0	Don't let babies get any shots at all. My best friend's 3 month old just died. A single mom has to explain to her 7 yr old daughter that she doesn't have a little sister anymore Let's Give Them A Better Year. Please Share This. Thank You. God Bless,
1	Yes, we’re planning on getting all vaccines for our little one. My family also refused the covid booster and flu vaccine and when I held strong about them not being able to see the baby over Christmas, they were really upset. My job is to protect my baby, if an adult decides to not get vaccinated then that is their choice, but they can’t be near my kid. Sorry not sorry.
0	'm 74, unvaxed. Over these 3.5yrs, I've spent much time in crowded homes, apartments, offices, businesses, events, cars, buses, & trains. I use diet, supplementation, exercise, rest, sleep, & socialization to stay well. c100 of my vaxed friends, relatives, neighbors, & acquaintances, have had COVID, many severely. I've remained disease-free.
1	COVID19 mortality rate using China's numbers is close to 4%. Swine Flu infected almost 60 Million Americans in 2009-2010. COVID19 seems to be more contagious. 60M x 4% = 2.4 Million Dead. Without a vaccine, the worst case scenario is scary.
1	Happy to join the millions who are vaccinated. Every shot counts towards a safer world
0	Yesterday a coworker was talking about how she's still sick and has always been a person who would only get sick like once every six years and this year she's been sick several times. I made a comment about how I felt blessed that I haven't gotten sick once and haven't missed a day and it's May but I wasn't vaccinated. She twittered about how she had a newborn and because her newborn "had no immunity" she decided to get the vaccine. I made no more comment but the she just went on talking about all her sickness and how "WEIRD" it is, like we never even mentioned the vax and there could be no connection if we did. It was WEIRD. It kind of freaked me out....like I just watched a deceiving spirit put a plastic bag over her head. Just "la-la-la...anyway, I just don't know why I keep getting sick. I think it's because my immune system is still low after the pregnancy." They don't want to admit they screwed up their bodies and lives.
1	Vacination is the only cure to fight against COVID-19
0	My friend got the vaccine and now has lingering fatigue. No way I'm getting it.
1	I have had both vaccines thank you to the scientists
0	Vaccines contain harmful ingredients like mercury and aluminum. No thanks, I'll pass.
0	My 17 yr old received a shot an now has heart issue and did not have before.
1	I've gotten the flu shot every year since I was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes at 7 here in Canada. Never once had a problem except sore arm and maybe a slight headache. Safety is always preferable to ICU 2.0.
0	Yeah that's not completely true. First off A doesn't always lead to B - There is an X chance for the vaccine to do XYZ and some of which are not known because of limited testing has been done only for so long. For example long-term complications are something nobody knows about not to mention short term ones aren't always mapped out correctly.
0	Oh, just neuropathy? My friend got the vaccine and had a stroke at 20 years old. You lucked out.
1	If it was as unsafe as you say, cancers, heart problems, dying, etc, in any meaningful numbers, then the vaccine would simply not be available. The amount of lawsuits they would face would make such an endeavour to be completely unrealistic. It's safe. The chance of harm is so very much lower than getting covid without a vaccine, so don't worry.
1	The US media allows charlatans and grifters to rise to the top. Worse, their nonsense gets translated into Arabic and spread by our idiots.Good thing I live in a country with mandatory vaccination.
1	If your child has an autoimmune disorder you should be PRO vaccine, even if it means not vaccinating that child. You need the healthy children around your child to be vaccinated so they don't spread these preventable illnesses to yours
0	Not a thing. Never took the first one.
0	worst part: people were FORCED to take it....
1	We live in age were many of the communal diseases don't affect us because of vaccination programs of the past. Our parents, grandparents and beyond ensured this, by getting themselves and their kids vaccinated. Getting vaccinated isn't about protecting you, its about your neighbors or your friend who is immunocompromised. While the vast majority of us have gotten their vaccine(s), there are those that will refuse to due to misinformation and other factors. Make it mandatory, you can't go to school, work, the grocery store, gyms, everywhere.
1	It's incredible how science has come together to create vaccines in record time. Trust the process.
1	Yay I’m so happy that This pandemic Is coming to an end Because we have a really good vaccine and Now I get to socialize with my family and friends again and Even make new friends And do all those fun things I’ve been missing over the last year.
0	Proud of this young lady for saying NO. I know so many people who had injections and are ill now. I have a 23 year old female friend who had to go on BLOOD THINNERS just days after her first AZ shot (she worked with the elderly at the time). She had to get a second to keep her job, despite her injuries. I thank GOD every single day that I donot watch TV, listen to propaganda or this utter nonsense.
1	Can you survive Covid without it. Possibly depending on ur health.
1	Currently, im taking my time seeing what happens to get my vaccine, i am not anti vax im just genuinely scared of it all and am uncertain. If i have to, in order to work, i will get it, until then i will wait and see what happens. However, i would gladly get a vaccine that doesnt require 3 within a year
0	Yet people still continue to wear them 4 years later. It's a mental disorder.
1	Wow very well organized. Nice to see something good.
1	For someone who had COVID-19 in March 2020, my first dose of Pfizer was the worst, feeling drowsy, entire body warm, but no registered fever, and fatigued with a sore arm for just 2 days. My second dose, which I got a few days ago, no side effects at all. I had a severe case of COVID last year and I’m in my 20s for reference for others to read and share their experiences. Otherwise, I feel great and I hope this brings us closer to the end of this terrible nightmare we are living in
1	I’m always amazed by the sheer time and effort these people put into avoiding a FREE miracle shot which will protect you and the people around you, courtesy of modern medicine.
0	Pure blood here, keep the faith No vaxxers
1	Great informative video! Although as a Canadian with a right to a choice, ill take any except for the Astrazeneca one.
1	Humanity is starting to take some big steps against the virus now.
1	Why are people not understanding this other then vaccine is the wrong word for the shot, it's not you won't get it, you won't get it as bad.
0	I refused to take the shots. I thought the way in which they kept pushing it was highly suspect. I kept getting phone calls from my GP and text messages asking why I hadn't taken it.  I was never an anti-vaxxer, up until this drama unfolded. Now I wouldn't take one ever again.
1	Comparing the flu vaccine's effectiveness to COVID's is eye-opening. We're doing well with a higher efficacy rate, which means we could see real progress against the spread.
0	By not taking the jab, I'm 100% safe from side effects and 99% safe from covid.
0	Why are there more covid deaths daily in VIC than NSW? Is it a vaccination thing? I’m genuinely confused…
0	I am unvaccinated and don't have any regrets.
1	Got it last week, everything was and still is fine lmao.
0	I'm not getting the vaccine cuz there is scientific proof that the vaccine can cause infertility.
0	I fear the societal pressure to vaccinate. It feels like those who question or refuse are immediately labeled as anti-science or uncaring, which isn't always the case.
0	It absolutely did thickens your blood destroying your white cells
1	like all other Vaccines, they are not a cure. You can still get the flue after getting the Flu shot. The Covid-19 Vaccine, like others are designed to lessen the effects and symptoms of the Virus they are made for. People who are Vaccinated are less likely ( not 100%), to end up in the Hospital, or have serious symptoms.
1	After getting the vaccine, I feel safe and protected. It's our responsibility to protect ourselves and others by getting vaccinated.
1	I feel fine now. Why would I want to feel horrible after taking the vaccines?
0	Tbere were worrying effects in my very local area  but not made public (1st vaccines given). I chose to refuse vaccine , despite being pressured. I am so glad I kept to my decision.
1	I got my vaccine yesterday and I was SUPER sleepy all afternoon!! But I am still SO HAPPY I got to get it!!
0	How about talking about why you would vax your healthy child when there is virtually no risk of them dying from covid? Like .002
0	You can see why the dodgy covid vaccine was easily pushed through, the system is beyond corrupt.
1	Like it or not, im taking it.
0	the vaccine agenda is a global conspiracy to control the masses!
1	mRNA vaccines have been tested clinically for years, They are safer, the RNA stays outside of the nucleus so the DNA is not altered, and they are cleaner since they are not synthesized using chicken eggs. Also they can be rolled out and tweaked faster the traditional vaccines.
0	I personally know 11 people including family that died from COVID injections.
1	Thank you for explaining this to normal person, I’m more understand of efficiency of vaccines now 🙏🏻
1	Trump must know that he is losing voters by the bushel…he told them last night he is vaxxed AND he got his booster. The dumb sheep booed him. Some people you just can’t reach.
0	My 27 year old daughter had Pfizer both times BUT her booster, which was Pfizer, has left her with many complications. Swelling under her arm pit immediately then it moved into the breast (same side) causing one to be larger than the other. Then swelling on her side and yesterday she became swollen under her chin. Lymph nodes have gone crazy. This is 35 days in and no better. Three trips to the ER for swelling and low grade fevers and fatigue!
1	After getting fully vaccinated, I was able to reunite with my elderly parents without fear. It's such a relief knowing that we're all protected and can enjoy our family gatherings safely again.
1	"Vaccination is a proven and effective way to control the spread of diseases."
0	Causes heart issues.
0	We lined up in elem school to get the polio vaccine. I had a classmate who contracted polio & was severely crippled. I still see her & the effects of polio. Viruses like polio & Covid are dangerous & can only be controlled by the vaccines. Don't believe anti-vaxxers.
1	The irony that the allergic one with vaccine is the one that should become the biggest vaccine promoter is beautiful, herd immunity is an amazing thing
0	I heard a voice inside of me telling me not to take it! So I didn’t.
0	Worse in this case. Now you will have to deal with the side effects of the 'vaccine' for the rest of your life.
1	If you are responsible, you will contact and listen to someone of valued trust such as your Doctor! It is your own fault if you believe everything on social media, the internet or fox. You have been given reliable information on COVID for 4 years now. We know people who have died. If we refuse to listen to reputable doctors, health departments, etc. then all the rest of us can do is continue to be up to date on vaccinations, social distance, wash hands, wear masks, .and hope for the best for you because you have been warned and will not listen. Go with your political pundits you fools. sm
1	Ima take it  to see if it’s ok for my grandma she gets sick fast and she doesn’t  heal well and if she gets COVID I’m afraid she won’t make it so I’m willing to be a lab rat and hopefully my grandma can take it soon
1	Laughing off the idea that a microchip is in my vaccine. 😂 Im Trusting science, not baseless theories
1	you don't lose the antibodies that quickly after being vaccinated. The immune response after second shot of Pfizer or moderna is much stronger and longer lasting than for natural infection. The vaccine leaves you with with memory B cells and T cells which can quickly spur your body to manufacture antibodies once the virus is detected. These cells stick around for several years!
0	As someone with a complex medical history, I'm uncertain about how the vaccine might affect me differently
1	I got moderna last April 2 shots and developed a heart inflammation
0	Let's be honest; most doctors knew this vaccine was dangerous a couple of years ago. Doctors need to begin speaking out. Better late than never.
1	A vaccinated person limits transmission of the virus, and is far less likely to be hospitalized or die
1	Had all Covid vaccines and never did I get Covid. Dr. Fauci is the best.
1	It's like being anti-surgery because there's a death rate for every operation.
0	I’m worried about potential DNA manipulation or unknown genetic effects.
0	I am proud to say that neither me, my three kids, or my four grandkids ever got the first dose of the poison.
1	I have autism and I find it so funny when people say vaccines cause autism
0	It's all about control. They want to track us and manipulate our DNA with those so-called 'vaccines.' I'm not falling for it.
0	I got the vaccine today and didn’t look at it. Now that I’m watching this video I can’t believe how long the needle is LOL. Good thing I didn’t look at the needle when I got my vaccine. I would’ve freaked out. It honestly felt like a small pinch, no pain at all and super fast!
0	Haven't been pinched. I guess I'm safer and more effective without it.
0	I won't be getting that shot. No way in hell.
1	A salute to the vaccine for saving us
1	Had two dozes of AstraZeneca. Mild symptoms after the first doze. None after the second one .Glad I am somehow protected
0	Joint pain
1	I really would prefer to not catch the disease and to stay alive (I am a high-risk golden oldie). The vaccine will help me achieve this lofty goal.
0	So nice for the news to give free advertising to pharma companies. Oh wait — no they pay the bills for the networks
0	My best friend died a few months ago from a blood clot.. he was laid in his chair for two days until a neighbour alerted the Police to kick down his door to find him.  He laughed at me when I tried to tell him not to take this poison, I told him that his immune system would fight the virus off.. but he didn’t listen. He had every shot and every booster shot.. now he is gone.
0	Nobody knows the side effects of that vaccine on me. I prefer not having a vaccine that may harm or kill me, just for the sake of protecting others. And we all have a right to do this, do you get that? The vaccine or the experiment that’s gonna happen to me, I’ll make the call for that. What do you expect?
0	Those who took the vaccine were ignorant of the corruption inherent in the industry
0	"THEY" WANT TO BOOST YOU TO THE "OTHER SIDE" FOLKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0	I took the jab and I've not felt the same since like my immune system is weaker than what it was.
0	This young lady is absolutely right! If it had happened to only a few, then we could argue that the not so safe and effective wasnt the cause but there are too many stories to ignore. My dad is in icu right now after the main and two boosts of Fizer. I begged him not to get it but all the fear mongering on the news scared him into getting it. His prostate cancer came back after 15+ years in remission and now a new more aggressive cancer, blood clots in both legs, kidney failure and a host of other issues. At 73 years old, this man was healthy with nothing more than taking eye drops to prevent glaucoma. I hope all who pushed this meets the same fate.
1	Okay I take please give
0	THANK GOD I DID NOT GET THE VACCINE
1	seriously, dude? You folks can be truly exasperating. There’s definitely a time and a place to question what government tries to cram down our throats or into our arms and I’m totally with you on that and I appreciate the role you play in keeping the Man honest. But I feel strongly that this is not one of those times. I will be getting the vaccine because I very much care about my fellow citizens and their well-being as much as my own.
1	I encourage everyone to get vaccinated. It's a step towards normalcy and a return to a more carefree life.
0	They literally forced this on people and now the castle in the sand is crumbling...
0	I did not get the clot shot. The surgeon general of my state came out saying the shot is linked to blood clots and heart failure. I’m so glad I listened to my instincts and not the doctors trying to force me to take it.
1	Vaccines have a proven track record of eradicating or controlling deadly diseases
0	My heart breaks for everyone that took these vaccines. God bless each of you.
0	Natural immunity is better than vaccine injury to your immune system . Censorship is concealing the truth.
0	So glad I stood strong and never got one of those jabs.
0	The lack of situational awareness and honesty with this guy is mind boggling…they simply cannot say “vaccines aren’t working”
0	Don't worry about not having enough, they can give mine to someone else or flush it down the toilet
0	I won't get the vaccine until more research is done. Better safe than sorry.
0	Mikhail Gorbachev once said that it was the Chernobyl disaster which was the catalyst for the collapse of the Soviet Union. The jab is worse than Chernobyl in my opinion.
0	In short, this has been the biggest con in history.
0	I’ll still never forgive those who demonized people for not having the ‘Jab.’ — ThomasKing
0	So based iron today's inpatient figures and the fact that 2/3 of covid inpatients are vaccinated you are talking about maybe 40-50 under 50s max. If it only takes 40-50 unvaccinated under 50s to cripple our health service, something else is VERY wrong
0	I received my 1st Moderna shot 3 weeks ago.  I had a sore arm for a few days.  This past Thursday, I felt like I was going to black out on a call, but then it went away. Last night I felt lightheaded and nauseous and it didn't go away. I went to the urgent care and learned I tested positive for COVID. It makes me wonder about getting the 2nd shot now.
0	Anything that would have aborted foetal tissue in vaccine. I’m not putting in my body.
1	Feeling relieved after getting vaccinated. It's a small step for me but a giant leap for community immunity.
1	Kids:when i grow up Anti-vax parents:that where i’m gonna stop you
0	Safe and effective is two lies. The article cites roughly 200 per 100,000 severe reactions and that is only two reaction categories of many. So the FDA considers these dead and/or dying acceptable collateral damage – – – for what ? We should inject these toxins for what possible benefit ? The only benefit cited to date is the possibility of mitigating symptoms. So we are to risk death and the many other known severe adverse reactions for the possibility of lessened symptoms ? The injected still acquire and spread the disease. It is a fool’s gamble.
1	Not taking the vaccine is like not wanting this to end
1	18 and an immunocompromised essential worker!! you best believe i got that shot as soon as possible lol
0	Nobody needs them.  None of them are safe bring back the liability.
1	But I know someone, who knew the brother in law, of a cousins friend, who died from the "vaccine ". clearly not safe!
1	Community leader, everyone in community vaccinated, stop spread of COVID-19.
0	At this point, I've lost all trust in the "experts". Even if every jab was a "kill shot", they'd still be chanting 'safe and effective'..
0	Off course there were short cuts or it would have been put through the long established procedures. You admit, with no shame whatsoever, that the pressures caused by the pandemic meant it had to be authorised for emergency use only. This is undeniable so please, please stop denying it. Or stop vaccination until it has achieved the usual tests
0	What happens if the immune system doesn't (for some reason) identify the cells with the antigen as foreign? Will it just keep on replucating?
1	Yes! Vaccinations work, as it reads in the second
1	Grateful for the science and research that went into these vaccines. Proud to be fully vaccinated!
0	Being young and healthy, I feel that my natural immunity is more than capable of handling the virus without needing a vaccine.
1	I got my second dose last week! So grateful to the folks in my community for volunteering their time to ensure anyone that wants a vaccine can get it. I hope others are utilizing the heck out of that link!
1	Gramps got his shot, no issues. Big sigh of relief here!
0	Unvaccinated. Never took part in this pantomime as history has taught me not too. Still alive and well,  turning off my tv has been the best vaccine money can buy, 100% safe and effective!
0	Nothing happens, they keep asking I keep refusing. Ignore the guilt trip it is psychological manipulation.
0	The increase in the number of vaccines children receive today is alarming.
1	No clue about the shape of the Earth but even scientists aren't claiming global warming anymore.  It's just "climate change" now.  You seriously just repeat government talking points and have no clue what you're actually talking about.  You honestly believe cow farts are the largest reason for climate change, but you're calling me stupid.  Lol.
1	I work in an ER and people are spreading this like wildfire along with h1n1 and RSV. We learned NOTHING
1	I received my first dose of Moderna and have some of the side effects (mostly soreness in the arm and chills), but I am so thankful to have had the opportunity to get the vaccine :)
0	Good I hope they rush it through even faster and force everyone to take it, what could go wrong.
0	I went with Pfizer and got thrombocytopenia. I guess pick your poison, literally.
1	Shoutout to the scientists who worked hard on these vaccines. Proud to be fully vaccinated and contributing to community immunity!
1	What I've noticed with my covid jab 2 doses are... 1) more energy 2) helps with insomnia 3) muscles tend to become stronger 4) protect yourself against covid Thanks and cheers
1	I’m also vaccinated with 3 boosters and I still haven’t got it. Unless of course I have had it and I was a symptomatic.
1	You’re right. No-one wants you dead, aside from the people your diseased child will infect, and you will be responsible for their suffering. Is wasn’t the tobacco scientists that were corrupted, it was  the people in charge of the companies that chose whether that data was released to the public.So no, the people in charge of all future scientific knowledge on earth are not “easily corrupted”, you just want to believe that everyone is stupid except you, but in reality, your stupidity will inevitably get someone killed, and it will be YOUR FAULT.
1	The vaccine is a light at the end of a long tunnel
1	The benefits of getting vaccinated far outweigh the risks.
1	Great video! I would love a separate Hankschannel/scishow (etc) video about the vaccine manufacturer process, the checks, the things they did and didn’t speed up in the process etc. I’m all for vaccines and will definitely get one when I can, but I also can’t help but be slightly nervous about whether or not they rushed the process of this one (although maybe that’s not a rational fear). I think a video spelling out the process, safety checks, discussing what data we do and don’t have regarding the vaccine, and elaborating more on that side of things
1	Got my Moderna booster a week before unknowingly spending time with family members who developed Covid a few days later. So far, so good. Was worth the chills and fatigue!
0	There's too much pressure to get vaccinated. It's overwhelming
0	My mom got auto immune condition after vaccine of two doses. Our life has become hell.
0	Not buying. Good fortune with your shots
0	Yeah, but what happens when you get vaccinated... then infected? Multiple times for many people.
1	I'm going to get mine on Friday and I'm very scared of needles but I'm going to do it
0	AM I ready to line up with the rest of the SHEEP to get this Booster jab for EG.5 ???  NOT !!! NOT Happening !! GOD Bless us ALL.
1	Protecting your children’s right to a healthy start in life begins from birth. It's critical to complete all their routine vaccination.💊
1	Finally vaccinated. Feels like the end is in sight.
1	Congrats girl for the vaccine !! yayyy
1	The anti vaxxers are ridiculous in my opinion and don't seem to have a full grasp of what autism is.
0	The only way to end the pandemic is to get vaccinated. However, no scientific evidence has been presented regarding the efficacy and the safety of the current vaccines. Without safety, no vaccine should be given to large populations.
1	He joins a long list of covidiots who died after refusing the vax. You ignore your doctor’s vax recommendation, yet go to the same doc when you get sick. That makes no sense, it’s the logic of a 5yo kid.
0	My heart said no; my head said no. I said yes to my instinct and said no to the 'vaccine'. Happy and healthy.
0	I can't see myself having a vaccination when it's against my will.
1	I had the Astra first shot and asked the doctor how effective it is, she answered round 95% and also educated me on a couple of other facts so, just ask your doctors anything to do with health, next time lol.
0	I'm unvaccinated. Something about it never sat right with me and I fully support body autonomy. I'm happy people are finally being brave and speaking out against the forced mandates.
1	here in Portugal with an almost 100% vaccine rate, mask-wearing *out of respect for others has worked amazingly... I am triple vaxed. no health issues and no problems... I'm SO glad Portugal handled this way.
0	I didn't take one vaccine, haven't been sick with any colds or flu or covid, while the people around me who had at least two vaccines, all got covid and very sick after the second shot
0	I feel like whoever wrote this article has clearly been wearing a mask too long and the lack of oxygen killed their last remaining brain cells. I don't think I could even type up the headline without feeling like a fool, much less write this whole article! This is clearly only here to push dangerous pro-vaccine propaganda. Please, do some research before trying to state your silly ideas as facts! If you just discount something that disagrees with your agenda as a "conspiracy theory" without doing even a speck of research, you're the one living the conspiracy.
1	THIS is why I and my entire family got our shots, if we do happen to get sick we will most likely not be pushing daisies....and we will leave the hospital beds for the ones who need them. I feel sorry for the unvaxxed who actually get to the point of ventilators, it was an easy fix but they chose to not accept it.
0	To find out months later, after people are getting the vaccination, they're still getting COVID. So what's the point? I just don't believe in the vaccination. It scares me too much.
1	The markets are reacting well to the vaccine news, and that's a positive sign for all of us, not just economically but for public health too.
0	Concerned about the vaccine's long-term effects. Need more data.
1	Almost a year post-vaccine my immune system is fine. I've only caught 1 fairly typical cold, nothing more severe. And I've heard no actual credible evidence that anyone else is having it worse. On the other hand, vaccine misinformation causes Covid deaths.
1	I was an idiot and did not get the booster. I am recovering now from a very very bad Covid infection. Get the booster!
1	I have 1700 registered patients. Our practice has 20,000. No one has died from the vaccine not been seriously vaccine injured but we have had some adverse effects which have been registered with CARM.
0	I personally know of four that died after their first jab. Two others now have rare cancers after their jabs.
0	I'm not vaccinated, and I'm fine. I've never gotten COVID-19, and I don't see why I need to get vaccinated now.
0	“Does the vaccine give you Covid-19?” Dr. Fauci: Well yes, but actually no.
0	let me finish the headline for you alex: "Whats the magic number of COVID vaccines needed to kill you".
1	Every day is 2020 for anti-vaxxers. They miss the battle against public health.
0	I've heard too many stories of adverse reactions to the vaccine; it's not worth the risk.
0	Chose not to be vaccinated.Everyone we know who is vaccinated is really sick or suffering from heart issues or blood clots.
1	The World went to Hell when "feelings" were equated to facts.
0	Vaccine fatigue... hahahaha . That's not it.
1	Such great relief to see people finally being vaccinated, I hope the government will be able to provide the second dose in due time.
1	Got my pfizer vaccine today. Feeling good, just a little bit tired. Looking forward to putting COVID behind us.
0	Imagine if he hadn’t had any shots, might have totally avoided COVID! Just like me
1	If there isn't a specific reason why one might not want to take the vaccine, I actually think it should be mandatory, as many people don't think beyond their noses and decline despite there being no reason not to.
1	Hundreds of millions of people have received these vaccines and so far have had no adverse health effects, unlike those who have contracted COVID. Harm only occurs in a few cases per million vaccinations.
0	What I don't understand is how people who are vaccinated keep attacking people who are unvaxxed because they're saying you're putting them at risk
0	Messenger Rna no thanks
1	For those of us who care about kids (hopefully all of us) this is a big issue It will also help to protect the unvaccinated and reduce the numbers of infections in the whole community as well as in kids
1	Of course, followed by trolls. What you are saying rings very true for many in my family this week. I got my booster four days before getting sick. Everyone else was long vaccinated. They got aches and pains and sore throat, etc., But I got a may headache and fever and couldn't function for three days. It was apparent the booster helped them greatly and that I should have had booster antibodies sooner.
0	I’m not putting that jab in my body
1	"People, even if you get vaccinated, don't stop using masks and taking care of yourselves."
0	My parents haven’t been the same after they took it, it’s like they developed memory lost
0	Natural immunity is better than pumping our kids with chemicals.
1	You need to get a Booster Shot right now because there is a new variant out there called Omicron
1	avoiding all vaccines because you had a bad reaction... is like avoiding all fruit because you ended up being allergic to apples…
0	The pressure I endured from friends and some family members was unrelenting. But I knew deep down this was dangerous! I was prepared to walk away from every relationship and determined to stand my ground.   Two of my friends developed aggressive cancers who were otherwise very healthy.   One family member is suffering from heart issues. I fully expect to be at a lot of funerals in the near future.  But the best thing about Covid is it taught me  just how evil our own government is.  I will NEVER trust our government or the pharmaceutical industry, again! Rest assured I’m not the only one.
0	I'm skipping the vaccine. Just not for me.
0	im the only one not vaxxed in my immediate family. After seeing this, I'm very worried for them. I tried so hard to get them to not do it.
1	Glad to see her tell her story. It is tough for people to admit they were wrong but to come out and say it to the world is even harder. Trouble is most anti vaccers only listen to what they want to hear
1	Vaccination make us free from Covid
1	So glad I got the jab! No regrets at all! Best thing to ever happen!
0	My redneck ass is not taking the vaccine.
0	I have a immune system. Not taking that stuff. Already had covid and it wasn’t much to it.
1	Every vaccine given is a candle in the darkness of this pandemic. It's a collective effort to light the way forward.
0	Im so glad I didnt take the Vax!!! You fools took the bait.. Biggear scam in the world history. You were deceived!!!
1	Fun fact, even if 99.99% of those 90,000 weren’t COVID (common argument that the numbers are a lie), 3x more died of COVID than had an allergic reaction.
1	I got my booster at Walgreen's and didn't experience side effects or symptoms other than a sore arm.
0	"I faced tremendous social pressure. I lost friendships, even family, for not getting vaccinated. I always doubted their good intentions and the effectiveness of that vaccine."
0	i will never take one after , first dose damage me , how horrific
0	Someone who was perfectly healthy then had 3 heart attacks and other symptoms . It is perfectly reasonable to assume it might be a vaccine injury.
1	Got my first dose a month ago and i felt pale and had a sore arm for 2 days. Just got my second dose and it felt like nothing even happened.
0	I regret it massively, I didnt have chest pains until I got the fuckin thing.
1	None of the covid-19 vaccines have any effect on fertility. Moderna is best again omicron, so if you're getting vaxxed for the first time now, that's probably best if it's available, but if not, get whatever one is available. It's most important to be vaccinated, ASAP.
0	I know one person who died of heart attack at 38, and another one who got a blood clot in brain, both were healthy prior to vaccine.
1	I really appreciate that instead of just calling people idiots, you take the time to thoroughly educate people. I just feel like it does so much more to actually encourage people to get vaccinated and
0	20% of people getting the covid vaccinations have died from those vaccinations another 35% have had myocarditis and pericarditis as a side effect. This is not a vaccine it is a kill Jab.
0	The pressure I endured from friends and some family members was unrelenting. But I knew deep down this was dangerous! I was prepared to walk away from every relationship and determined to stand my ground.
1	So glad the vaccines are bringing things back to normal. Thanks to everyone who has been vaccinated so far.
1	i wanna get the vaccine so bad but my parents won't let me, but i turn 18 in a month and i am fully ready to get vaccinated then
1	I had a 102 Fever, chills, body aches, headache, lower back pain for 2 days, etc. but I would do it again. It's better than having covid and NOT BEING ABLE TO BREATHE!!!
1	Hank, thanks for doing this video. I believe in the general safety of vaccines, but needed reassurance on anything COVID-related developed under the current administration. Thanks for the process clarification
1	I'm reading that the vaccine's protection is strong, and even if it wanes a bit over time, it's still going to make a massive difference. This is how we beat this thing.
1	These unbelievably stupid, spiteful bastards. If these decisions only affected the adults that want to go risk themselves, fine. Let them. But it affects children who can't get the vaccine. Or some cancer or other medical conditions where you legitimately shouldn't get the vaccine. Even worse, this just sets up virus incubators that allow the delta variant to mutate even further to an echo variant and raises the risk that even those who are vaccinated are no longer protected. These people are endangering all of us, not just them. And all out of virtue signaling spite.
0	"I believe in personal responsibility and choice when it comes to healthcare decisions, including vaccines."
0	Getting both vaccines and boosters can cause cancer before 40
0	I’m envious of people who rightly denied the vaccine. We’ve all been fooled and have been injected with graphene oxide that transmits cellular data.
0	And just think. The virus itself has a 99.98% survival rate in the entire world!
1	My carryout lobster roll, coleslaw, and flan were even more delicious because I’m fully vaxxed and haven’t lost my senses of taste and smell. It’s also a snap to eat those big rosy chunks of lobster when not on a ventilator.
0	I made the mistake of getting it (Moderna) so I could travel - in Sept of 2021. 38 year old male, never been to doctor for any disease or health related problem. Have now had chest pain for over a year, high bp, constant headaches and had to get put on beta blockers as well as getting stress test. Wish I would have listened to my instincts on this one. I hope all that got it make it through this alive.
0	By not taking the jab, I'm 100% safe from side effects and 99% safe from covid.
0	Biggest mistake of my life was taking the shot to get my wife out of lockdown. 2 years later and I still have heart problems and thrombosis in my legs. F the entire medical mafia.
1	The vaccine was easier than I thought. glad I got it
1	At the time of covid many countries don't have an Indian vaccination because it is only 70 to 75 % effective. But now we know that they are accepting vaccinations with 10 to 15 effective.
0	The higher the number of vaccines previously received, the higher the risk of contracting COVID-19
1	Liberty is not higher than safety and security. Having a safe and secure society is what gives you liberty.
1	Welcome to vaccinated gang
1	I’ve been doing Chemotherapy’s for almost 10 years now. They are a miracle from God. I got the vaccine and started having bed wetting episodes; never been an issue before, but after a month or two I got over it. And yes if given the option I’d do it again. I know COVID-19 is a killer I was shielded from. Thank God Amen.
0	i’m unvaccinated against COVID and i honestly am so happy i never got it
0	Still proudly unvaccinated here
0	There are too many unknowns about the vaccine's long-term effects. Not worth the risk.
1	Good video. I will be getting my booster shot soon. I vouleenteer at my local hospital.
0	My girlfriend almost died from kidney failure immediately upon getting the vaccine.
0	I did not get the clot shot. The surgeon general of my state came out saying the shot is linked to blood clots and heart failure. I’m so glad I listened to my instincts and not the doctors trying to force me to take it.
1	There's the statistics saying that people are significantly less likely to experience negative side-effects if they're vaccinated.
1	Vaccines are our best defense against preventable diseases.
1	I hate that we have come to a time when we shut up a Doctor and tell them they are wrong because we have "investigated"
1	"Avoid going out to the street to not infect others, use face masks, eat well, and get vaccinated."
1	Are there anti-vaxxers who also reject the notion that antibiotics help fight off bacterial infections? I would guess so, but I'm not 100% sure.
1	Had mild arm pain, but that's it. Worth it for the protection.
0	Haven't got it, couldn't be happier.
0	It's so safe They force you to take it
0	Does the vaccine protect you? Not one bit. Just the opposite.
0	If your neighbor died two days after taking the COVID jab, and local news refused to report it, you can smell something was wrong.
0	Stop the fear and lies campaign!
0	I personally know 11 people including family that died from COVID injections.
1	Got my pfizer vaccine today. Feeling good, just a little bit tired. Looking forward to putting COVID behind us.
1	The vaccine is our passport back to normal life. Excited to have mine!
1	Vaccines are helpful for prevention. The more people that get them, the more helpful they are. They are helpful—not infallible. I get all mine, and am rarely ill (lucky me). Better yet—I don’t make anyone else sick.
1	Pfizer gang represent
0	Many people have sustained serious permanent damage because of trusting a broken and corrupt system.
1	I've never seen so much lying and deception surrounding any one particular topic before this one, in my entire life.
0	I’m still a little wary as someone who has in the past had an overactive immune system
0	Yeah, I had one and a booster and a heart attack . Then I contracted Covid and had a positive d dimer and now I can barely walk. They can keep their vaccines.
0	The vaccine doesn't stop transmission
0	It's not so much mistrust of vaccines, but rather mistrust of those pushing it
0	The Best way to prevent Long Covid is staying unvaccinated!
1	Is there a medical test to find out if someone will have an adverse reaction to any of these vaccines?
0	People are definitely regretting their vaccination status now. Not me. Haven’t had any of them. Haven’t had COVID either. I made the smart choice, I haven’t died prematurely of a heart attack either.
0	Science says you do not need a jab for something that has a 99.97% recovery rate.
1	I'm with the doctor and with the science. ✋🏼❤️
1	Billions of doses have been given, with tens of thousands of studies conducted, and in that time, scientific consensus has overwhelmingly concluded that the vaccine is safe with the handful of major side effects being both exceedingly rare and only observed in the first few weeks after vaccination
0	I never got the vaccine nor the covid19. For me it was obvious from the start they're just chancing it because they needed to stick to something to soothe the masses. There was no real scientific consensus and I don't like politicians and random mouth breathers lecture me about what I need to put in my body.  Now that I see the studies about the many adverse side side effects I can only say I'm glad not to be a blind follower.  The whole thing might've been over way faster if we just let it run it's course and develop herd immunity that way.
1	The line “doctors are warning that if we don’t get a high enough level of vaccination we might get a series of variants” aged depressingly well.
1	Excellent explanation. Thanks for posting, but it won’t convince the anti vax and anti mask crowd. I guess they wouldn’t read the Wapo anyway!!
0	Why should I put something foreign in my body? Our immune systems are designed to handle these things naturally.
0	I'm by no means 'anti vax' But, this last year or so there has been a spat of people I know, all young and healthy people... having heart attacks and strokes
0	They've achived at making a very few people, extremely rich, and planting nothing but fear into everyone else!!! Good job!!
0	My aunt took first dose of covid 19 vaccine. She took her second dose on a Monday and passed away on a Friday.
0	WHO is a terrorist organization that must be stopped, defunded and dismantled. Largest threat to Western Civilization
0	Who should we believe? A man who has dedicated his life to the research of infectious diseases? Or a pathological liar who stares at Eclipses?  Imagine my dilemma.
1	Scientists and NHS we salute you.
1	Prevention is the ideal solution. The first precaution is not only environmental protection, but above all vaccination
0	Why do they recommend vaccines when there's so much controversy?
0	Gives you a permanent and irreversible heart condition like a boss
1	Get your vaccine so I don't get sick too!
1	Furthermore, vaccinated people have a lower viral load, so even if they are infected, they are still less likely to spread it.
1	Honestly, people that spread misinformation should be held accountable for the deaths they caused.
0	We need more people to come out to reveal the mass genocide of the globalists. We need all the data. Then we need to hold these vile people to account.
0	Let's be honest;  most doctors knew this vaccine was dangerous a couple of years ago.   Doctors need to begin speaking out.  Better late than never.
0	"I'm young and fit; the virus doesn't pose a significant threat to me. I'll pass on the vaccine for now."
1	Thank you so much for doing this video. I’m very compromised and will be high on the list for the vaccine in Canada. I’ve been scared. I’m less so now.
1	Anti vaxxers need your own island. You’d… “sort yourselves out”… in about 10 years.
1	I also was anti-vax. I was more the "I never got vaccines and I only had the chicken pox" type. I didn't ridicule others for getting it or stand real harsh about it. I planned to claim the religious exemption for my kids like my parents had done for my sister and I. When my daughter got cancer (pre-B ALL) it started to change. I had confidence in the chemotherapy but wouldn't allow vaccinations. As I started to think about it more it changed my viewpoint. I have gotten vaccinated for Covid and plan to get my children up to date with their vaccinations. I understand.
0	Natural remedies are being suppressed
1	I can’t wait to have it myself and I mean the vaccine and then a life back hopefully x
1	Vaxxed and ready to eat ass
1	I'm not anti-vaccine and understand the efficacy for older populations, but feel I get labelled as such for asking questions about my own health...
1	My daughter is 19 months. She got her COVID shot once it was available over the summer. I also received my 1st and 2nd booster while I was pregnant with her because I'm a healthcare worker and they were newly available.  I'll be getting her boosted the moment it's an option. Because the side effects of Covid scare me a lot more than the (very minor) risk that she may have an advsere effect from the vaccine. Realistically, I don't think I will be able to protect her from COVID forever though I'm certainly trying my best. So I want her immune system to have the best boost I can give her to reduce her risks of getting a bad case of it.  I spent two months working the COVID floor at the start of the pandemic. I've both cared for the dead and watched hearts stop on the monitors. I've seen how ugly this can get and saw it before we had any way to treat it or make ourselves safer against it. I want to do everything I can to prevent my daughter from going through what I saw.
1	Got my second dose today! Feeling grateful for science and ready to contribute to herd immunity
0	My wife and I got the initial shot and then one booster.  Neither of us got Covid.  However, we know a lot of people who got 2 or 3 shots and still got Covid.  Some more serious than others.  We also know people who didn’t get any shots and some got Covid of varying seriousness while others didn’t get it at all.  I also believe that it will be around a long time and will continue to produce more variants, some of which will produce illness and others will not.  Like a lot of viruses, i.e. the flu, common cold, Covid can mutate into different variants faster than science can keep up.  Getting a flu shot every year protects you from about 50% of flu variants.  I imagine the Covid vaccines will be similar.  The other thing about the Covid vaccines is the newness of mRNA vaccines and the known and unknown possible side effects.  I know several people who have had side effects such as rapid heart beat or the vaccine simply made them very sick.  Of course the drug companies can deny it was the vaccines and the problems were just coincidence.  Not to mention they are immune from any lawsuits.  I do believe that mRNA vaccines can be the wave of the future for a lot of illnesses but we are not there yet.  So, our decision at this point is to not get any further shots but rather try to keep our immunes systems working well.  I am 72 and have had  tremor dominant PD for 11 yrs. I got DBS in 2020 and it has helped a lot.  I exercise a lot and “try” to eat properly.  My background is in neuroscience with ongoing studies through MIT in genetics and biochemistry.  I am no expert by any means, but have done a lot of homework on the mRNA vaccines.
0	injecting toxins into your body for the 'greater good' is a dangerous mindset.
0	Punish the manufacturers.
1	I trust the advice of medical professionals and scientists who have dedicated their lives to studying vaccines. Their expertise gives me confidence in the COVID-19 vaccine.
0	These shots were rushed to the market without enough testing and the people who took the shot are nothing more than test rats.
0	Here bud let me tell you the side effects of vaccines...                       A short fever
1	The sooner we all have access to the vaccine, the quicker we can curb the spread of this virus.
0	No one can predict anything unless it's planned
0	Wow and people still believe in this plandemic bul crap !
0	Just because everyone else is doing something doesn't mean it's right for me
1	So all you people who don’t want to take the vaccine... don’t take it. Why do you feel the need to announce to the world and criticize others making their own decisions. Really... no one is losing sleep over how you feel about it...lol
1	Embrace the vaccine, embrace life. It's our path to freedom from the virus
1	Happy to say that after a month on a waiting list mom and I were finally able to get our first vaccines. Arm soar a‚Ä¶ https://t.co/z2J32fUG2H
0	But it's not really a vaccine it's a retrovirus the overwrites your immune system. Genetic manipulation
0	Nah, I'm not buying into the whole vaccine thing
0	Amazing coincidence that Vaccine deaths went up in that year we were all told to wear FaceDiapers!
1	Better late than never! Get vaccinated!
0	Do not listen! It’s like playing Russian roulette with your life!
1	I got 3 booster shot. Fpizer shot.
0	That is true, however less people becoming severely ill won’t prevent transmission, and hence won’t won’t stop a pandemic, which is the goal of these vaccines.
0	These motherfuckers. I got the stink eye for refusing one of my children on a recent well visit a Covid vaccine. I also have a issue with dentist to pushing fluoride treatments. The fuck? it’s poison.
0	Never regretted not getting that shot.
1	I am finally at the point where most of my family and friends are fully vaccinated. I had lunch with my parents for the first time today in over a year.
1	when your kid is allergic to a vaccine...you have to promote vaccines to others to save your kid.
0	People are posting videos of their bodies strongly magnetizing various metals, and also lighting light bulbs from the same highly magnetized areas like the upper arm where they were vaccinated. Graphene oxide, representing 90% of the content of some of the vakses, is both magnetic and conductive
1	dont spread bad news about vaccine. research about it.
0	No vaccine
1	Welp, looks like the Facebook hillbilly anti-vaxxers are here.
1	Vaccination is a step towards returning to a sense of normalcy in our lives.
1	Anti-vaxxers are loons to start with, but when they get on their soap-boxes to take advantage of someone's tragic death to spew their nonsense, they're showing themselves to be disgusting human beings, too. Stupid AND shameful...

0	Live and let live people. Understand that people have individual beliefs and cannot be bullied into submission.
0	I'm not getting the vaccine because I don't trust it. You don't have to waste your time telling me it's FDA approved or doctors researched it. I don't trust doctors, some are puppets for their billion dollar corporations. Why is the government really caring for people now when they sell liquor (I drink alcohol even though there are bad effects), tobacco, weed, opioids when thousands of people are dying every year from this? If you have vaccine good for you, if you don't good for you. It's USA not North Korea. We have or had what is know to some "freedom". I actually quit my job because they required the vaccine and I said no, now I'm collecting unemployment even though I want to work but jobs are requiring the vaccine. Teachers are public servants getting paid by taxes, they shouldn't have a say for our kids what to do with their bodies.
0	Both my mother and step mother died shortly after 2nd booster a month apart . Can't believe these two are gone now! Very lonely!
0	I'm now fully convinced the covid 'vaccine' is being used for depopulation.
1	Experienced flu-like symptoms for a day after the shot, but now I'm feeling fine.
1	I hate Indiana but at least we have a republican governor that pushes vaccination against Covid
1	Vax rollout is a light in the dark. Feeling optimistic!
1	It’s amazing, and should be something we are all excited about. A HUGE advancement in the medical field and will change the future of vaccines. It’s a shame partisanship and drama is putting a damper on that.
1	Well, I got it as soon as I could. April 15 literally just happened and in California that's the date everyone can get it. I didn't qualify to get it any earlier and there are a lot of people in California.
1	The thing that kills me about this is the fact they think they're intelligent and special going against the mainstream. Like their opinion matters. It's like they're anti vaxx because it's 'cool' to go against the big pharms.
0	My sisters friends parent died after taking sinovac
0	Still pushing the shots here in Canada as well, right down to very young children. It is unimaginable and unforgivable
1	Vaccinated and feeling optimistic!
0	Safe ?  Which ones and where produced ?   There was Astrazeneca from Brasil for example . These were forged . There was attempt to plant them in Germany and possibly other European countries in this larger geo-political/religious agenda .
1	I signed up to be a vaccine tester with AstraZeneca, with my screening and injection scheduled for Monday. I have been informed there's a 33% chance I'll get a placebo instead of a vaccine but I think that was kind of my way of trying to get a vaccine as early as possible? :P I know that's rather selfish but I think the why's Hank described play into it. I don't want to fear being a vector for infection and hurt others, I want to reduce the strain on medical systems, and I want to help demonstrate vaccines are safe. Also, I work in office management, so when our office opens again (likely when a few million doses of the vaccine have been administered to NYC) I want to organize a "stick-up" party to celebrate the medical advances that make our day-to-day lives possible :D
0	It's not just young people. It's older people, too. My sister now has a heart murmur after 2nd dose. Yeah, you don't know you have it until your visiting nurse tells you.
1	Fear nothing. Just take the 💉
1	"There is no evidence that vaccines are effective." There's a difference between ignoring the evidence and not actually having it.
1	A step in the right direction.
0	Studying vaccine development prior to the COVID outbreak gave me all the information I needed to refuse the new vaccines. Best decision I ever made
1	Side effects of vaccine…….minimal. Side effects of COVID virus……….Death. Make your choice.
1	I got COVID a few weeks ago but was vaccinated. I only suffered a cough and a loss of taste. I shudder to think what would have happened if I got it a year ago before vaccinations opened 😔
1	My aunt already had her second shot an no real side effects. And i have been watching her close incase anything did.
0	More cons than pros with these vaccines
0	Just the fact that you can't sue drug companys makes me not want to take the jab.
1	Vaccination is not just about protecting yourself but also those who can't be vaccinated. #ProtectTheVulnerable
1	If you are an anti- vaxxer you are just supid
1	"The joy of knowing I'm doing my part to end the pandemic is worth the temporary discomfort of a shot."
0	Never got the Covid Vaccine, I am very lucky. My grandparents got very sick after the shot a week later.
1	I never understood vaccine hesitancy, but I could respect the opinion of people who didn't want it. Your body, your choice. However I have friends who didn't want to inject "that poison" but were perfectly willing to smoke a pack of 20s a day, drink all weekend and maybe even finish with a quick line or two of the back of a public bathroom toilet seat......
1	Getting vaccinated is an act of solidarity with healthcare workers who've been on the front lines.
1	Big rush to get it done then recall it later
0	Is it a coincidence that ever since they've "approved" the shot for 5-11 years olds that they're trying to normalize heart problems within that age demographic? Yeah... Totally normal for children to be having heart attacks... Nothing to see here…
0	I got the vaccine and when I got Covid it hit me hard. Then when I was pregnant my placenta ‘quit working’ and my daughter was nearly stillborn. She’s healthy but still small for her age at 6 months.
1	Vaccines will do the job slowly and quietly.
1	Wonderful!!!! Thank you science for being a light of hope!!!!
1	More #FAKENews debunked by the Associated Press: CLAIM: #BettyWhite told a news outlet she received a #COVID19 vaccine booster on Dec. 28, three days before her death, saying: “Eat healthy and get all your vaccines. I just got boosted today.” THE FACTS: The quote is fabricated.
0	How do they determine if death is from covid or vaccine? Did the vaccine cause covid? These are things that need answers, as right now many are getting covid after vaccination thus death attributed to covid NOT vaccine.  THAT is a problem that needs broken down to decipher the 2.
1	HAHAHAHAHA.. lol.  If you're vaccinated you're protected!  This entire video is spreading misinformation.
0	Congratulations to all the PureBloods who were not sheep.
0	Where's the transparency in vaccine trials? I have questions
1	As long as there’s any evidence supporting their argument, confirmation bias will make it impossible to change an antivaxxer’s mind without un-indoctrinating them. The best most of us can hope for is preventing anyone else from falling down the rabbit hole.
1	I love Jesus, and I am vaccinated. I feel like part of loving my neighbor is reducing the spread of disease.  I think the majority of my church is vaccinated, but there's a loud minority that isn't. That minority is the reason we haven't been back in person since this started because we don't trust them around our young kids.  I know plenty that are vaccinated and are believers. I know plenty that aren't vaccinated and are believers. Vaccination status isn't a salvation issue
0	My brother is unvaccinated. Travels the world. Had a mild case of Covid once. Took ivermectin and felt fine within 3 days. Never got it again despite subsequent exposures.
0	The fully #vaccinated are more at risk of dying from #COVID19 than the #unvaccinated.
0	This aged so well. Even my elderly parents are like “no more vaccines”. They blew all the belief in the medical establishment in 2 years…
1	Can we talk about how vaccines are the unsung heroes of public health? Game-changers.
0	The medical profession has become a joke . Watch this doctor play the victim card because he has no idea about the harms or potential harms of vaccines in general. It's amazing how uninformed so-called professionals can be.
1	I already got the shot; i need to use my brain if I plan on doing any good for people and I protect it with exercise, proper diet, sleep, and the Covid vaccine.
0	A PM who invested heavily into a pharma company which produces an unsafe vaccine if he had any integrity would apologize to the House and the people of this country, resign and 'face the music'. Who in their right mind would vote for this man.
0	I’m pro Vaccine I’m not pro this vaccine.
0	Ur ignorant if u chose to get these vaccines
1	There is some good news: The first doses of the #PfizerBioNTech vaccine arrived in California last night.
1	Vaccines are our most valuable tool for fighting epidemics so I welcome the news that has donated £20 million to help accelerate vaccine development to tackle this urgent crisis. Thank you for your leadership, . #COVID19
1	Some people are not ok with the side effects that come from the life saving drug but they are ok with the ones that come from taking drugs
1	we lost our uncle to covid. he was such a loving man but he was afraid of getting vaccinated, like most of our family. After his death, my parents started to take it seriously enough to consider getting the vaccine. Unfortunately, that clarity of mind didn't last too long and a while after they changed their minds again. I couldn't get vaccinated as I was under 18 and they wouldn't allow it and soon after we all ended up getting the virus. My father and mother have both been left with permanent health consequences. It is wild what misinformation can do to our world.
0	My step father passed away yesterday and he was vaccinated and had a booster. He said before he died he felt more ill after the booster
0	Innocent people do not think the way that wicked people think. It is heartbreaking that so many folks were persuaded by lies to accept “experimental vaccines”…poison.
0	A Pfizer director just admitted in front of Parliament that they never tested the vax. Everyone who took the jab is a walking human trial.
0	I’m a #pureblood for ever!
0	Because of the ridiculous politicalization of COVID vaccines people have stopped getting flu shots too which is scary. And the number of people NOT vaccinating their children is growing so it's a good bet Measles will be coming back.
1	I had my vaccine 11.58am 28th September felt fine next day sore arm and I started to feel tired And I been drinking lift plus a lot he he. First vaccine I have had in years.
1	I need to have it today!!!
0	I'm unvaccinated, happy, healthy, and ready to rock!
0	Why believe it's unsafe: because it's being forced on us and we're being lied to about it every step of the way.
0	Nothing pisses me off more than Drs. or anyone that says “it’s a good think you got the jab because you would have gotten soooooo much sicker”. How the fuck does anyone know how MUCH sicker I would have gotten.
0	Remember when everyone said covid vaccine mandates and vaccine passports were “conspiracy theories” ?
0	By not taking the jab, I'm 100% safe from side effects and 99% safe from covid.
1	I really wish they would show more of that on TV instead of all those depressing news about covid and political debates about every single decision.
0	Regretting not poisoning himself??? Of course he doesn't regret it!!! Heavens... How can they ask him such a ridiculous question. I DO regret taking it
1	I just got my first vaccine today. No side effects so far. Thank you to all the scientists and researchers around the world for making the vaccine available this early and thank you for this channel for spreading the science. Yes, it’s definitely OK to be smart. Science rules!!!!
0	It doesn't take a genius to think that injecting something that hijacks your cells to produce a foreign protein, has no dosage control for production of that protein, and no off switch, might not be a good idea! Immune systems pretty much attack anything that is not me...
1	I just got mine. But my arm is having small muscle spasm or pain. But no headache or flu systems. Am okay now.
0	Not heard anyone say they regretted NOT having the jab.
0	I did not get the clot shot. The surgeon general of my state came out saying the shot is linked to blood clots and heart failure. I’m so glad I listened to my instincts and not the doctors trying to force me to take it.
0	No thx
1	Vaccination is one of the most thoroughly researched medical interventions.
1	Let's work together for a healthier world
1	With so much great videos online at the fingertips, I hope people can use the internet for good. Please do your part and tell your friends if they are hesitant about accurate information. We can only be better if we help each other understand, not through ridicule or insult.
1	Why do you find it difficult to debate a point without being offensive?  There are countless credible sources of data that confirm that vaccines are dangerous.  The US Supreme court ruled that vaccines do come with an "accepted" level of danger.  Research from the largest vaccination program on earth (eradication of polio in India) concluded that the paralysis caused by the vaccine was higher than would have been expected from a polio epidemic.    The pharma companies pay doctors incentives to vaccinate, why would they need to pay off the doctors if they were so great?
0	notice how when logical questions are want to be asked, the topic is moved on? if you got any of the vaccines, i feel sorry for you as you have put your life in danger by getting it.
0	If you want to be sure to catch the flu every year, get the "vaccine" every year. The "vaccine" being a gene altering bioweapon nowadays (mRNA).
1	I got vaccinated to help end the cycle of lockdowns and restrictions.
1	Shout out to this pro at HyVee who administered my COVID19 vaccine, I was a little nervous but she was so reassuring!
1	Vaccines ---> ice cream ---> obesity, heart disease and diabetes! Vaccines are bad! ;)
1	As a hypochondriac, I surprisingly didn’t care about vaccine side effects because COVID is way scarier to me. I’m young but diabetic so I know I would not be having a fun time with the virus.
1	Just got mine today! We got the shipment in yesterday, and the hospital starting handing them out right away. No side effects so far, and it was quick and and almost completely painless.
1	Anti-vaxxers should be refused all medical help whatsoever. No medicines. No surgeries.
0	And this is why you wait for clinical trials to end. I'll wait thanks.
0	Operation Indoctrination Depopulation Inoculation Vaccination .
0	Studying vaccine development prior to the COVID outbreak gave me all the information I needed to refuse the new vaccines. Best decision I ever made
1	So sorry for the truly deserving vaccinated patients who can no longer receive medical attention because all ICU beds are full.
0	Got to be some kinda stupid to get the clot shot
1	Getting vaccinated not only protects me but also contributes to the greater good, helping to create a safer and healthier community for everyone.
0	They are just as likely to kill you as two shots are to protect you.
0	I would say my heart feels sorry for you, but my heart feels fine because I didn't get it.
1	Two days ago I tested positive for COVID (I'm fully vaxxed/boosted). Since then I've sneezed maybe three times and felt a little sleepy during a Zoom call. I seriously don't get the anti-vax argument. I would replace my blood with this stuff if I could. Get the damn vaccine.
0	In my 40 years, I can't recall getting a flu or a cold. I vaccinate myself last year jut to keep a job, and ever since I got covid 2 months after, and I got sick with flu 3 time, two times were very bad. That vaccine just destroyed an amazing immunity that I one's had.
0	Biggest scam ever perpetuated by the evil doers..
0	Once more, my wife and I were saved by our nurse-related senses tingling, telling us to avoid the vaccine at all costs.
1	I am proud to say that I'm getting my second vaccin(hopefully this week)
1	I got vaccinated because I want to protect vulnerable populations, such as the elderly and those with underlying health conditions. Vaccination helps create a safer environment for everyone.
1	i am not anti vax
0	my friends father died within a week of taking it
0	They are killing the taxpayers for something we fund for them. Do not take the vaccine if you dont want to be part of the rich people's evil plan in fortune making.
1	AstraZeneca, Moderna, Biontech/Pfizer are very reliable vaccines that have cleared even the high hurdles of the European Union. In my opinion, if they are allowed to be published in China at all, the risk from Covid19 is much greater than using one of the vaccines listed above. Biontech, in particular, has hardly any side effects and a simultaneous efficacy of 95%.
0	next time there is an experimental drug that comes out to treat something every single person in here is required to take it. if you dont youre fired.
0	Was completely healthy played basketball felt fine until I had the vaccine.
1	I got both Pfizer vaccines and I never had a single problem other than a sore arm the next day. This was about 3 months ago now. My entire family except my grandpa (who got moderna’s instead) got Pfizer and was perfectly fine. My grandpa who got the Moderna vaccine actually had a fever and a headache for a few days but was fine afterwards.
0	They want us to believe vaccines are safe, but it's all a lie!
0	It's not FDA approved
1	Much better than the side effects of not having the vaccine.
0	The flu is just your body detoxing
1	I heard a guy at work say “the vaccine doesn’t make you immune, what’s the point?” Not dying, that’s the point.
0	Im 29 and still blessed with great health, no vaccine no mask no tests, my immune system runs like a well oiled machine, no excessive sugar or fast food seems to do the trick
0	If Covid-19 didn’t start out as being political, we wouldn’t be having this discussion today.
0	I regret the first two jabs.
1	got my pfizer vaccine 2 days ago and my arm really hurt on the first day, but it's getting better. get ur vaccine yall and hope that this pandemic ends
0	Risks you say? Well when businesses were mandating it for people to work without them knowing the risks. I'm just so grateful that I never took the vaccine even though I lost my 20 year career at a hospital. I'm still alive. Had covid 14 months ago . No problem. My symptoms were less than my friends that are vaccinated.
1	Without vaccines ,the average life expectancy would be 40 tops
0	It’s call gain of function, master mind Anthony Fauci, he favor s dangerous expiriment in the whuham lab in China with American 🇺🇸 taxpayers money 💰, yes we will not comply!
0	The latest side effect from the vaccine is amnesia regarding major announcements by the FDA.
0	I absolutely regret getting the jab. I went with my father's advice taking the vaccine when I should have stood strong with my Mother choosing not to get the jab. Months shortly my father and I were diagnosed with Psoriasis.
0	The risk of any medical intervention should always be voluntary.  Never should we mandate anything like this.
1	I’m 64, and had my vaccines (“Better safe than sorry”). My 75-year-old husband refuses to get his. I guess he wants out of this marriage, and wants to leave me widowed a second time.
1	Just had my jab. Easy-peasy. Feeling a bit heroic tbh 😎 #vaccinated
0	More cons than pros with these vaccines
1	I’m 20 and just got my second dose today! I’m glad that I did something to protect the more vulnerable members of my family. The relief I feel is indescribable
1	Wife and I just got our 3rd boosters yesterday and we can’t say we’ve missed the sore arms, lethargy, and headaches that come afterwards… But it’s always better to be safe than sorry. Get the new booster folks, before you travel for the holidays
0	I still think about how absurd the medical advise was when I got myopericarditis from the first shot- recover and come back for another!
0	Im not sure I want to take it. I am afraid of needles and only the thought is enough to make me panic.
0	I'm concerned about the potential for vaccines to overburden the immune system.
0	People also have consequences from the JaB.
1	sounds like less republicans & more available parking to Me
0	If the vaccinated are so secure, why should they wear the mask?!? Otherwise they are not secure... How is it not obvious?!?
0	King Charles got turbo cancer because of the covid clotjabs
0	Just the fact that you can't sue drug companys makes me not want to take the jab.
1	Hearing boomers say they're not worried about #COVID19 (and I'm just some 'stupid bitch' for taking it seriously) because "everybody's going to get it" when they have insurance, there's no vaccine or cure, health systems can crash. and it's killing people worldwide. #OkayBoomer
1	Who would have known that 2 years after this video was posted would we enter an age where we need this video more than ever.
1	SINOVAC all the way!
1	found out this year that my parents are both Trump supporters, and fox-"news" fanatics and it has utterly destroyed the way I've perceived them in my 31 years. They're paranoid, and hateful, and ritualistically tearing myself and my brother down for choosing to vote for biden, and have even been spouting off nonesense about the Vaccin
1	Antivaxx are like : A soccer mom telling a pediatrician that he's wrong
1	Vaccines save lives. It's not just a slogan; it's a fact backed by decades of scientific research.
1	mRNA vaccines don’t use an actual virus BTW.  Even vaccines that do use a weak or inactive virus are much safer than catching the actual virus while being unvaccinated.
1	I'm proud to be vaccinated and encourage everyone to follow suit for a healthier tomorrow.
1	Excess mortality declined where people got vaccines, but continued to increase elsewhere, generally speaking.
1	Grateful for the tireless efforts of scientists and healthcare workers in developing and distributing COVID-19 vaccines worldwide.
0	"Congratulations to everyone who resisted and did not get vaccinated!! Thank you all!!"
0	Florida, where old people and the truth go to die! And I live here!!
1	I got my second shot a few days ago. Other than some mild effects that you get with the flu vaccine I felt fine after a day
1	I got vaccinated as soon as possible and I will get the booster. I never want to be sick like that.
1	I encourage everyone to get vaccinated so we can move closer to a world where COVID-19 no longer dictates how we live.
0	I am glad I watched this because it helped me realise that the shots are certainly unsafe.
1	They don't let unvaccinated dogs into pet friendly environments, I feel like not letting unvaccinated kids into schools is a solid argument.
1	You should get vaccinated because prevention is better than suffering and making other people suffer.
0	My heart said no; my head said no. I said yes to my instinct and said no to the 'vaccine'. Happy and healthy.
1	Get a vaccine for the sake of others, and take a one-in-a-million chance that something bad could happen? Of course I will.
0	I didn't need the shot because my perfectly functional immune system sorted the issue out for me.
0	By not taking the jab, I'm 100% safe from side effects and 99% safe from covid.
0	vaccines are a form of biological warfare. wake up before it's too late!
0	Mother in law had a stroke after jab. She decided to end her own life because it messed her up so bad. Where can we get justice?
0	My kids recovered easily from covid 19 and have zero need for this vacination. I don't care how well it works on others. It would be total risk filled over kill for them to get this.
1	I got vaccinated in May. I feel safe and my mom was in the ICU on life support, the Pfizer vaccine saved her life
1	GUYS!!!pray please its not a joke people are dying getting infected also dont be scared i know its a scary time but we gotta be brave and pray thank you god bless all
1	Can someone please talk to my mom and my family because they keep telling me not to get my son vaccinated and it irritates the heck out of me. I know they believe these people of Facebook and most of all, blindly follow their super right wing "our nation is the chosen nation" Pastor.
0	Unvaxed for life
0	A record-breaking 105 US children have died from flu so far this season Note: this is the flu not the #COVID19 virus (#Coronavirius), no one from the US has died from the the #nCoV19 And there's a vaccine for the flu virus, so get it.
1	The more people get vaccinated, the faster we can return to normalcy. Let's do this for ourselves and future generations
0	Losing my job was a price well worth paying to not have fallen victim to those monsters and their poison
0	They just never want to let this end. Its bordering on ridiculous now.
0	I have no reactions either, because i'm not injecting garbage just to travel or go to cinema
1	I’m going to get my booster in March
1	I did it for my family, friends, and community - get your COVID-19 vaccine today!
0	I'm still to meet anyone who says "ooh I really wish i got vaccinated"...I know many however who regret having the clot shot.
0	I encourage every Democrat to get the clot shot.  Please, do it!
1	Can't wait to get my 2 youngest kids vaccinated. This is nice to hear.
0	The only thing to know is that I will never take this poison.
0	Nobody regrets not getting the jab.
0	It’s working by giving you a blackout, dizziness nausea and a lot of side-effects.....but if you wanna travel you make sacrifices, whAt can I say more?
1	Lv.1 Vaccines  Lv.100 Essential oils   That's how anti-vax logic works.
0	I regret it. I have tinnitus now because of it
0	My mother died from a heart attack a few months ago after she took the vaccine. She’s never had cardiovascular problems in her life
0	The worrying thing is that people who were already immunosuppressed and were considered the most vulnerable, received all the boosters and are still being encouraged to have them.  If I understand this correctly, the vaccine was the last thing they needed.
1	Thanks for supporting the #COVID19 Solidarity Response Fund to equip the world's brave #healthworkers, provide care for those in need and drive research and innovation on vaccines and treatments to protect people from the #coronavirus.
0	COVID survival rates are high. I'll take my chances without the vaccine.
1	They should get lots of vaccines because the government really cares about people.
0	So thankful my family didn't fall for the jab.  Even my daughter with cancer, her Dr told her no vaccine
0	While there are gullible mugs with money, there will be unscrupulous doctors and charlatans willing to spread misinformation in order to extract it from them
1	Based on the data you leaked — I don’t see any evidence or red flags suggesting vaccines are causing deaths or even increasing risk of deaths Kirsch’s analyses and interpretation are total bunk
0	Go get another booster people...your last one is already expired probably. No animal got so many ln djectionz for any desease yet people take them as a regular pill. You guys do promote the intentions behind the interests of the ones that finance you as a particular entity, go figure!!
1	This Vaccine has made the infectious disease like Covid-19 a thing of the past; we’ve come to expect that public health and modern science can conquer all microbes.
1	excellent work by the people and the government involved in finding vaccine for the covid
0	Off course there were short cuts or it would have been put through the long established procedures. You admit, with no shame whatsoever, that the pressures caused by the pandemic meant it had to be authorised for emergency use only. This is undeniable so please, please stop denying it. Or stop vaccination until it has achieved the usual tests.
1	Here in the real world the COVID vaccines have saved millions of lives. I am grateful for them.
0	I don't trust the COVID vaccine because it was developed too quickly. We don't know the long-term effects.
0	I'm impressed with Dr. Fauci still doing his job advising all Americans how to get past this pandemic after a year of death threats and calls to fire him and arrest him.
1	PEOPLE NEED TO WAKE UP AND GET VACCINATED!!
1	I took my 1st dose and I'm 14, can't wait for my 2nd one 😃
1	If they don’t want to put out misinformation, they should probably shut the whole app down because it’s full of it.
0	The monovalent Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccines are no longer authorized for use in the United States.
1	Vaccinated people are probably also more likely to come in when sick.
0	Lots of pro vax bots in this thread. Sad some still believe they made the right decision to inject poison inside their bodies. Sad people believe their health hasn’t been effect because they “are still alive” now… OP look into covid vax detox. There are some ways to cleanse your body of all the toxins brought by those “vaxs.”
0	If you like being sick, and are tired of being alive, keep getting boosted.
1	I will be in line on day one. Bring it.
0	The longer this has gone on, the more relieved I am that I never got the jab.
1	If people choose not be vaccinated against Covid, they have to accept the restraints that come with that. When they act to deter or prevent others from vaccination they are breaking the law. What happened at Milton Keynes was a breach of the peace. They should be arrested.
0	I wouldn't take the vax for a million free hamburgers+fries OR donuts.
1	this will indeed help people get vaccinated and stop falling for false rumors form media and news. its outrageous
1	A mRNA is how Herpes and HIV will be cured. It's the future of science.
0	Perhaps the 3 vaccine shots have compromised his immune system. Apparently that is a thing.
1	The vaccine is proof of what we can achieve when we work together
0	Do NOT get another Covid Moderna shot or booster!!!
1	If your child has an autoimmune disorder you should be PRO vaccine, even if it means not vaccinating that child. You need the healthy children around your child to be vaccinated so they don't spread these preventable illnesses to yours
0	t does not work as intended bc it neither prevents you from getting or spreading Covid. If I took 5 measles vaccines in 3 years and still got measles and could spread measles to others I would say it didn’t work
1	Christopher said his parents had had vaccinations and still got covid. I was wondering if they survived because they were vaccinated?
0	Guys please don't take the vaccine. It's part of the new world order.
1	I am vaccinated and my husband and son are not. We all got sick back after Christmas and they were so sick. I on the other hand barely had any symptoms. It could have been maybe I just did not get that sick or whatever but I am glad I am vaccinated.
1	Half a million lives saved because of the COVID-19 vaccine. Vaccines work!
0	My blood type is (O-) I don't smoke, I don't drink alcohol, I don't take drugs, I live in the Atlas Mountains in Algeria, every day I drink olive oil for lunch and dinner, I didn't get sick with corona and I didn't get vaccinated, and I'm happy with my choice
1	So what I got is, from the individual health's perspective ALL these vaccines are effective in mitigating its effect on the body, regardless of the declared efficacy. But from the pandemic perspective, efficacy is important since the higher efficacy the better it is in preventing the spread of the disease.
0	This vaccine is part of their agenda. Nobody wants a microchip
0	My mother just got diagnosed with very early stages of dementia at 76. She was fine before that damn vax.
1	16, in the U.S and I got my first dose practically days after it was available for my age group. Even though I’m not too concerned about getting covid I’m terrified of unknowingly giving it to those around me. If I can prevent others from possibly getting
0	I've had 2 covid vaccines, and I've been suffering from more infections and ill health than my previous record of 15 years with only 2 - 3 days off work due to sickness.
1	will be getting the vaccine asap. My parents are both in several high risk categories. I have been so scared for them and want to protect them as much as possible.
0	pharmaceutical companies manipulate data to hide the dangers of vaccines!!
1	Smh. People…seriously. The vaccines are safe, and they work. Worried that getting the vaccine will allow Bill Gates to track you or control you or some other totally stupid thing? Consider this: he could track you far more easily because you have an internet capable device and you post online all the time. So worry about that instead of some fake bullshit about what’s not in those vaccines. Folks: get the fucking vaccine already.
1	I find nurses who are distrustful of vaccines should go back to nursing school. They probably missed a few key subjects.
1	Even though I had a super bad reaction to my first dose, I will still be taking the second one. My individual and temporary suffering is completely worth the steps to return back to normal life.
1	Cool so get vaccinated and be extra protected.
1	As a healthcare worker, getting vaccinated was a no-brainer. It's not just about my safety but also about the patients I care for.
1	Won't take vaccine because not FDA approved. instead takes dewormer for animals not FDA approved
0	The push for universal vaccination overlooks natural and holistic approaches to health.
0	The only thing to know is that I will never take this poison.
0	It's criminal that he is not doing anything to help curb this pandemic. He needs to be held accountable for his criminal actions.
1	pfizer-BioNTech saved the whole world
0	Stay away from the poison
0	You can stick your vaccines, I'll never get one.
0	I am glad I watched this because it helped me realise that the shots are certainly unsafe.
1	Jabbed yesterday. Feel nothing and I am a pretty sensitive man
1	cant wait ot put "full vaccinated" on my dating profiles
0	Whiskey is the only shot you need 💪🥃
0	TELL US THE LONGTERM SIDE EFFECTS??? OH WAIT YOU CANT!!!
1	The widespread use of vaccines is a testament to the collective commitment to public health.
0	My grandfather died 1 week after getting the shot. That is enough for me. I have not received the shot nor has my wife & child & we are fine.
0	Don't care. I won't be getting it.
0	2 years on still unvaccinated and haven't seen the hospital
1	My kids got all their vaccines
0	Some recipients did report aches and pains ! I know people who struggle to sleep, have had constant headaches , 2 strokes and one death after being vaccinated. Also several with long COVID who have been vaccinated. So is the vaccine working or did it just take out the 0.5% most vulnerable. Leaving the less vulnerable to make the vaccine look like a success ??
0	#COVID19 DOESN’T HAVE AS MANY DEATHS AS THE FLU... wrong, COVID-19 has a higher percentage of death rate than this flu season. No one shuts down for the flu, car accidents or cancer... we have a vaccine for the flu, car regulations and treatments for cancer.
1	I got my COVID shot and flu shot in October!
1	Almost everyone will soon have COVID-19 antibodies. It’s now a choice about whether you want to get them from a safe vaccine jab or a potentially deadly viral infection.
0	I'm a 30 year old woman, I got the Pfizer vaccine back in September. After the second dose, I actually had heart pain and pressure. It's sporadic and comes and goes with weeks in between, but it's worrying. I can't say I blame people for not wanting to get vaccinated, just be sure to look after yourself. There are times I regret getting it, because my heart was fine before.
0	Of course they are safe! Did you read the disclaimer before you sign it? You give up all your rights
1	Well…yeah but you can still get Covid if you got the vaccine. I’m very stupid and in my tiny brain, this means the vaccine doesn’t work.
0	The vaccines don’t work.  Everyone I know has had Covid at least once and some as many as three times.  The risk/reward is too far gone to support the vaccines.
0	Anyone still getting the Covid vaccine has not done their homework, and anyone pushing it should be charged!
1	Astra zeneca had the issue with a specific type of clot. Noticed because something like 30 showed up instead of the normal 6 per month. It halted worldwide immunization for that vaccine until age group specifications were recommended. I don’t understand how people think millions died of the vaccine without noticing when we have this example.
1	Someone sent me a useless broadcast voicenote urging people not to get vaccinated even if a vaccine is produced saying its all a ploy by white people to kill off africans since the #COVID19 isnt doing it effectively. cant believe people can be so stupid, Blocked &; reported ASAP!
1	I understand that some people are skeptical of new technologies like mRNA vaccines, but they've gone through rigorous clinical trials and shown impressive efficacy.
1	You did it for me at the very least. This video encouraged me to overcome my fear and properly google the vaccine, only to find my fears were grossly exaggerated.  Thank you Hank
0	An esteemed cardiologist in Canada died after having the booster just recently. Add him to the lists of death and injury that MSM won't tell you about.
0	Did you include myocarditis and a destroyed immune system?
1	I had my first Pfizer vaccine 2 weeks ago, felt a tad woozy about 9 hours later but a good nights sleep and I woke feeling great. Second vaccine this week. So far, all great!
1	COVID IS STILL A THING, PEOPLE. GET VACCINATED.
0	Also, it's no secret today that some people suffered tragic fate after getting the vaccine - some even the same day.
1	Looking forward to getting a covid booster along with my annual flu vaccination. Reject the health benefits of modern medicine at your own peril.
1	vaccinated , didn’t turn into a zombie mug.  vaccines brings us closer, thank you science
1	I've had both doses, and I'm ready to hug my loved ones without fear. That's the power of the vaccine
0	Gut feelings save peoples lives all the time, not vaccine
1	Yeah it seems vaccine induced immunity is way stronger than natural.
1	We need a sixth booster. NOW.
1	A world with vaccines is a safer world. Let's keep the momentum going and get vaccinated!
1	I would choose to take the vaccine as there is to my mind sufficient evidence to confirm that the virus and the infection that it causes exists.
1	Thank you for these facts!!!!! I am excited to get the vaccine, but all of these anti coronavirus vaxxers kind of make me nervous, but you settled all of that down!!
0	Proudly unvaccinated throughout this whole experience. Your videos are awesome!
0	It’s a choice and my choice is no!
1	Non-vaccinated person: exists Diseases: It's free real estate
1	Nobody likes getting sick. Get vaccinated and help stop the spread of Illnesses like flu and COVID in your family and in your community.
1	I am pro vax, got all my shots.
1	When your unvaccinated child gets sick and kills a baby who is too young for immunization, what are you going to do??? Irresponsible parenting at its worst.
0	Vaccine? You mean poison distribution don't you?
1	idc what people say I believe that our scientists are hard workers
0	Shoutout to the smart ones who didn’t take any Covid shots
0	BULL, CHANGING PEOPLE'S DNA WITH THE VACC'S AIN'T THE WAY TO DO IT. PERIOD
0	"I'm making the call today the Covid 19 Vaccines should be removed from the market" "They're not safe for human use"
0	I speak for absolutely everyone when I say we aren’t taking a shot ever again
0	Let me get this straight it's a fairly new technology but its safe. No serious concerns except for those who died or have disability. Clinical trials are not done until 2023 but it's safe. INGENIOUS! Thank you
0	Well, for one, it is not a "Vaccine".  That is, it wasn't a vaccine when rolled out according the the CDC's definition.  It did not meet the definition of a "Vaccine" until many months later when the CDC revised the definition of a vaccine on its web site.  These people are despicable.
0	I am unvaccinated and don't have any regrets.
1	We've been getting flu shot boosters for decade..y'all are weird.
0	They can tell you what why they think it will work but no clue how your body will actually respond over time. Dangerous
1	Get vaccinated. Get tested. Isolate. Long  COVID is real and it can devastating
0	I’m grateful I never got vaccinated. Bummed that two of my kids did get vaccinated
0	It doesn’t require anything. There are plenty of folks out there that haven’t even had a first shot and are doing fine.
1	I got mine vaccine a month ago and it's honestly such a relief. Glad you got yours.
1	You’re an idiot Roger . #COVID19 is new virus , contagious BEFORE symptoms. 3x more likely to get, 5x more likely to die as flu. No vaccine. Attacks cells in lungs. Vulnerable &; elderly antibodies overreact causing organ failure &; death. This isn’t planning it’s abdication.
0	I am unvaccinated and don't have any regrets.
0	My mom suddenly died from a major stroke after having her C-19 shots. She was in perfect health prior too.
1	Are you blaming a covid vaccine?  Fun fact Alberta and Saskatchewan are the least covid vaccinated provinces yet they have the highest excess deaths while the highest covid vaccinated provinces have the least.  Nothing to see here
0	Pfizer knew that their 'vaccine' could kill so I don't know what you are talking about there.
1	No thanks. First do no harm. If. A healthcare worker is not vaccinated I don't want them near my sick and vulnerable relatives a risk I wouldn't want that CAN be prevented #vaccineswork
0	Fauci's legacy -- millions dead, billions sickened, and a forever virus introduced into humanity.
0	Thank God I am Unvaccinated
0	My condolences to all who were coerced into taking this “vaccine”
1	Science has always been the exit strategy from this horrendous pandemic. An inability to grasp science is NOT a valid argument against vaccination.
1	Vaccine skepticism? Not for me! Got my booster, and I'm ready to face any variant. Don't skip the vaccine, embrace it!
0	I personally know 11 people including family that died from COVID injections.
0	I am so relieved I did not take it and neither did my husband or kids. I can sleep at night knowing that poison is not in us. It disgusts me that people who hang onto ignorance because they are scared it's in them can't look around at all the people speaking out. All the young people who collapsed and died is heart breaking
1	I have had both vaccines thank you to the scientists
1	godspeed to these scientists
0	The pressure to vaccinate without questioning feels like a violation of my personal freedom. I need to stand up for what I believe is right.
0	Best way to stay healthy is to avoid the vaccine and ignore WHO. Do the opposite of what they say, enjoy your life, forget about covid and don't listen to so called 'expert' advice.
0	Force test all politicians, scientists and med personnel first. Let's see how long this BS lasts.
1	Feeling protected thanks to the vaccine and encouraging everyone to get theirs!
0	I am so relieved I did not take the vaccine and neither did my husband or kids. I can sleep at night knowing that poison is not in us
0	How come covid vaxin is considered as safe when its still on trial... Human trials ?
1	Vaccination is literally the reason that we don’t have to worry about smallpox and polio
0	I was forced to take the jab to remain employed it was definitely not worth it.
0	The vaccine basically fucks you up for life
1	Vaccination is not just a personal choice; it's a responsibility to our community.
0	4 out 5 of my brothers have gotten it, all of them vaccinated. My one brother has gotten it twice. My sister-in-law triple vexed has gotten it. Here I am unvaccinated and have never gotten covid and they still think I’m the crazy one.
1	spread positivity
0	Call me when you have it dialed in. This cash cow, getting paid for not inventing a vaccine? But we can mandate it so you must get vaxxed? $$$$$$$
1	Yaaaaaaaa!
1	Natural immunity is great, but why not boost it with a vaccine? It's a double win.
1	It is wrong and criminal to stigmatise, discriminate, assault, ethnitize, insult or to slure any person, people or nation who are or maybe infected with #COVID19. All everyone may need is a speedy scientific discovery of a vaccine to treat the infected and combat this enemy.
1	I'm 24 I work in Health Care and I got my first vaccine in December and the 2nd in January. Getting the vaccine and see everyone of of my coworkers get the vaccine had been incredibly helpful with my anxiety
0	But but but the shot is supposed to fix everything 😂
0	Thank you for everything that you do Dr John. I will never forget how non-vaccinated people were treated by The vaccinated.
0	Even my doctor said he was not getting anymore covid vaccines because he couldn't handle the side effects
0	My ex was forced to take the jab or lose her remote medical scheduling job. I’m still trying to wrap my mind around why they would force remote workers to get vaxxed.
1	GLOBAL VACCINATION may be the only solution to COVID-19 as a GLOBAL EPIDEMIC (PANDEMIC)
1	We live in the age of MISINFORMATION, more people would rather believe some random post they saw a friend post on Facebook than listen to an actual scientist. Truly crazy times we live in
1	I sure hope so. I WANT one.
1	It’s cool because when I had my 2nd dose I didn’t feel anything it really helped my immune system good
1	it was important to get a covid-19 vaxx in an effort to participate in herd immunity without too many jabs.
0	Protect your families and children from this poison
1	lets put end to pandemic by getting vaccinated
1	I have had 3 Moderna vaccinations, with little or no reactions, and I have been very well.  We are no longer wearing masks. These MRNA vaccines have saved many lives!
0	It's muck. Wish I'd never had it.
0	As a healthcare worker these adverse reactions are more common than you think. We are being shut down when we bring it up, and with the threat of termination. I have seen so many bleeding issues (strokes, gi bleed, rectal bleeds, tumors) than ever before. 😢
0	Anyone else waiting to see if there are any long-term effects first?
1	There’s not a chance in hell anti-vaxxers know how to pronounce dossier, let alone know what it is.
0	Im against this shot also but can yall tell me what do you think about this vaccine? Im curious to hear your opinions
1	Got my pfizer vaccine today. Feeling good, just a little bit tired. Looking forward to putting COVID behind us.
0	Considering that COVID-19 has such a high survival rate, I really don't understand why there is such a huge emphasis on vaccination.
1	That does sound pretty promising expect they should run further testing on people to see if it can get us back too 2019 normalish.
0	Well put it this way i didnt have a vaccine,  feel perfectly fine  but then my grandparents had 4 vaccines and now all of a sudden in their 60 are starting to have heart issue's and the doctors have told them dont have the vaccines
0	Wouldn’t trust a vaccine now- ever again and regret every one I ever did
0	Why are they injecting our babies with chemicals right after birth?
0	The jabbed are ticking time bombs
0	Vaccinated People can still Spread the Virus.
0	WILL NOT COMPLY ! This is the greatest hoax ever perpetuated on mankind.
1	I’m glad I got it, never understood the resistance. Data is solid on it, mRNA has been in develop for ages.
0	Nobody wants that poison shot
1	Got my first Pfizer jab about 22 hours ago. Feeling great, no side effects except for a slightly sore arm. Apparently the second vaccine hits harder though with chills fever and fatigue (which is a normal reaction after getting vaccinated).
1	Numbers speak for themselves, those dying from COVID were not vaccinated. Those vaccinated with the 1st jab have been able to bounce back quick after infection or not been infected at all. Look at the stats instead of listening to people with gold teeth and no medical degree.
0	2 people passed in my family one after 2 dose , 1 after 15 days of first shot, both were healthy prior vaccination
0	my wifes family are sick all the time, when they weren't before the jab.
0	It's bad for scientists careers to say the vaccine caused heart problems, so you won't see a study on it. If you do those scientists will be labeled as fringe, be denied funding, etc.
0	Looks like even those who did take it had mental health repercussions... As I warned from the start.
0	Vaccine is not for everyone, and it must not to be forced.
1	nah...I'm going to listen to the people at wal-mart who barely graduated highschool.
0	NOPE! Never allowing another Controlavirus poison
0	Didn't take the poison. Stood strong. A role model for human rights. Thank you Novak!
0	I'll be honest, if no one told me Covid exists, I would never even know I was in a pandemic.
0	Thanks man. You’re the go to dude on Covid 19 vaccination status. An honest credible voice asking the right questions and offering factual information answers-at last
0	Giving this poison to children is a crime against humanity
1	My mom felt the same way until she was in a coma for two months fighting for her life. First thing she said we she came out of it was “I’m getting the shot”.
0	I don't trust the pharmaceutical companies behind these vaccines. Their profit motives raise red flags for me
0	I NEVER took the jab. I was pressured by my own family, criticized, and bullied but i stood my ground. MY BODY MY CHOICE RIGHT?
1	“The vaccine will be made available across the UK from next week." Nice!
1	People spreading lurs saying theyre getting blood clots and heart diseases bs
0	The data that proves Covid vaccines are the deadliest drug in the long history of Western medicine is taken from Pfizer’s own documents.
0	I know several people now that wish they have never taken this poison
1	This vaccine is created in the exact same way the seasonal flu vaccine is created (deactivated covid). It is probably the safest and most studied vaccine we have
1	One step closer to ending this covid nightmare
0	If you want to take the risk with an experimental drug, that is your choice. For me & my family we choose to let our immune systems do the job they were created for.
0	I had Moderna shots. My booster was a half dose. I had very mild reactions to all three shots. However I felt the booster the most. I spent a day resting on the couch, drinking tea and napping. Mostly fatigue, some aches and chills. Felt 100% better the next day.
0	No one knows how high the risks are because there’s no long term safety data on this particular vaccine. You’re going into the great, wild unknown.
1	> More unvaccinated deaths than vaccinate  That's not demonstrably true in any way.   It's also more complex.  It's about how many lives vaccines actually save (not too many in the first world) and how many they take.  Not just how many deaths from diseases, but how many deaths from diseases that would have occurred without the vaccine. Which is not many. Maybe an extra 10-20% extra deaths..   Vaccines don't remove all deaths, they barely scratched the surface of removing many at all.  They prevent some deaths.   Are those, some deaths it prevents, more than the deaths vaccines take?  No one knows for sure.  Because no one is willing to investigate exactly how many deaths vaccines are causing..  However of course they are perfectly happy addressing how many deaths diseases cause, because all they want is to say the diseases are bad, and make people think they are serious, they have no interest in button under scrutiny their own marketing products.
0	So every fall a new variant will appear to urge people get the "new" vaccine booster? I think we are on to you guys by now!!
0	Still don't want to show your hidden sms deal with Pfizer on all the vaccines you bought stealing tax payers money? And what about the turbo cancers we are seeing after the Covid-19 vaccines you pushed on the public with Pfizer CEO hand in hand?
0	By not taking the shots I am 100% safe from adverse reactions and 99.98% safe from Covid
0	I didn't need the shot because my perfectly functional immune system sorted the issue out for me.
0	No, forcing anyone to have any medical procedure for fear of job loss is completely immoral
1	Anti vaxers are beyond help.
0	People who don’t get vaccinated are fired. The command level of a position directly overrides the constitution. No one finds it strange.
0	My mother was healthy with mild arthritis before the "vaccine". After the vaccine and the subsequent booster shots she developed pneumonia Parkinson's severe rashes and full-blown arthritis!!! She was a strong healthy woman now 3 years later she is wheelchair-bound in a nursing home!!!
0	The fact that he is the only “doctor” speaking on this publicly should tell you all that you need to know. It’s easy for one person to keep up a lie than numerous people.
0	The people who have taken the vaccine are in denial because they are afraid to face reality.
0	Everybody who has an mRNA injection will die within 3 to 5 years, even if they have had only one injection
0	This is like when the police investigate the police to find that there was no misconduct by the police.
0	Unless you have something positive to say about COVID vaccination, we don't want to hear about it.
0	I’m unvaxed, only masked when absolutely necessary (so rarely) and flew last week, and last month. No COVID to date
0	Yeah go ahead and be part of the population reduction! Being the nice guy I am I'll let someone else have mine!
1	Even if Vaccines caused Autism (which it doesn’t by the way) would you rather have a healthy child that has autism or have your child have a disease that could’ve been prevented with vaccines with the side effect of making your child autistic?
1	the ministry of health has confirmed that the country is in its 3rd  wave which is expected to last for 2-3 months depending on how people respond to covid 19 SOPs  not forgetting vaccination.
1	Become vaccinated. To be anti-vaccine is to be #ProCovid.
0	For me, the fact all negatives are being ignored, says there's clearly another reason for it all.
1	I am a teacher and I have no complaints about mandatory vaccination.
1	vaccine side effects were nothing compared to having covid, I'll take a sore arm over that any day
1	More than 99.99% of people fully vaccinated against Covid-19 have not had a breakthrough case resulting in hospitalization or death, according to the latest data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
0	My doctor said he would never take an experimental drug, end of story.
0	Still not taking it. LOL!
1	Corona vaccine, a relatively normal U.S. president  Is 2021 going to be okay?
0	I regret getting the vaccine even though I’m a 52-year-old woman because I don’t think I needed it
0	I still haven’t gotten any Covid Vaccines
0	Most of them were fired, not suspended.!!!!
1	I got my second dose last week! So grateful to the folks in my community for volunteering their time to ensure anyone that wants a vaccine can get it. I hope others are utilizing the heck out of that link!
0	Absolutely nothing. That's what I need to know.
0	I regret TAKING IT. Worst mistake of my life!
1	As a law student I timed my first dose so that I would get my second dose right after my last final. I think we will see an uptick of young people getting vaccinated in late may and early June because students are worried about feeling sick during finals.
0	Remember when they said the unvaccinated would die? I'm still here and quite healthy. My other peers, who got the shot because of fear, aren't doing so well
0	You ain't putting no concoction into me.
0	Big Pharma is making $billions from worldwide mass murder genocide.
1	Voluntarily choosing to allow the virus an opportunity to use you as a host to propagate itself and possibly mutate into a vaccine resistant strain that will wipe out the entirety of our progress is not a right.
1	People are dying and the vaccination is our best way out of the pandemic.
1	mRNA vaccines have been so safe and effective that they are now being developed for influenza and HIV
0	Just concerned about the long term implications... something nobody can really address with confidence.
1	My dad is high risk and got the first of two covid shots, he's getting his second one today and he has felt completely fine.
0	The vaccine doesn't guarantee 100% immunity, so why take the risk?
1	Let's all do our part by getting vaccinated and protecting ourselves and those around us.
0	Cripes. So what's in the J&J vaccine, heart murmurs?
0	Frightening that you are “not allowed to disagree” no matter how long this has been going on and continues to… that phrase like no other fills me with fear.
0	Considering that the j.a.b. Don’t stop you from getting Covid, this video is pointless.  God Bless
1	I'm just gonna say, as someone who lost my dad to covid less than three weeks ago, if a vaccine is available and you are medically able to receive it, but you deliberately choose not to? I have zero respect for you.
1	I LOOK - FEEL - and ACT the same way that I did before the #vaccination
1	The CDC just recommended a new round of boosters for everyone the other day. And as expected, conservative media is melting down about it again. But even beyond that, they’ve been getting back into “COVID temper tantrum” mode for about a week or so now that we’re moving into the fall.
0	Follow the money!
1	They put the shot inside me, and I'm dead inside. Does that count?
0	Injecting this poison left me with bad back pain
1	"But the long term effects of it changing your DNA!!" is an interesting way to say, "I slept through my high school biology class and don't care who knows it"
1	Christian here. Vaccines are awesome!
0	pharmaceutical companies need to be held accountable for all the deaths in the mayhem and their lives that they have ruined. I'm surprised the CEOs don't have a bullet right through their heads.
1	You are now protected, as much as one can be. It is a great feeling
0	everyone is tweaking about coronavirus but HIV/AIDS has killed over 650,000 people in the US alone since the 1960s and there’s still no vaccine. COVID-19 has killed 3,800. People are trying desperately to care about something that isn’t a minority group and it’s so frustrating
0	Experiencing heart weakness since Pfizer, also hormonal imbalance
0	Please, I need to understand: if the vaccines have to be stored at such low temperatures to keep the particles in tact, how is it that they are safe to use after being at a vaccination site for hours at room temperature before being injected into an arm? Is this safe?
0	"The rushed development of the vaccine raises concerns about its overall safety and efficacy."
1	Anti-vaxxers are the reason I made sure all my vaccinations are up to date.
1	I have had both vaccines thank you to the scientists
1	This is basically the same message sent from the German health department. If you don't plan on getting vaccinated, plan on getting the virus, being very sick, and possibly dying. This is not hysteria, this is a fact.
1	And a vaccine literally introduces the virus to your immune system in a non harmful way... Good food doesn't produce antibodies, a vaccine does.
0	Swabbing shit to see if they have a mild cold.. You could probably convince them to do anything at this point, as long as you mention covid.
0	The people who avoided all of the chemical injections are the winners and have nothing to worry about and will have a longer life longevity. Congratulations to all of you!
0	I saw too many of my family have life changing side effects. Where those who caught COVID recovered just fine.
0	These people are insane, I can’t imagine giving this crap to a six month old. Better plan would just be don’t get any of these.
0	i’m not scared about an allergic reaction i’m scared about the long term effects because we don’t know what they are
0	Proudly pure blood
0	Firstly they are NOT vaccines! They are an experimental jab. The jabs are safe? Oh dear! haha
0	IF IT'S A VIRUS, KILL IT WITH IVERMECTIN. OR HCQ, OR MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES.  YOU CAN'T DO THAT WITH ANY VACCINE...BUT THE TIME THEY'VE COME UP WITH A VACCINE FOR IT, IT HAS MUTATED AWAY FROM WHAT IT WAS AND THE VACCINE DOESN'T WORK...AND INSTEAD, THE VACCINE GIVES YOU THE DISEASE ALONG WITH THE KITCHEN SINK OF EXTRA CRAP THEY PUT INTO IT BECAUSE THEY COULD...AND YOU DIE FROM IT A FEW YEARS DOWN THE ROAD...LIKE THE COVID VAX THAT IS KILLING ALL OUR YOUNG PEOPLE NOW.
0	When all the famous people in the world and the richest line up to get the vaccine - the same one they would have injected into this woman - then I will consider it.
1	...and in other news, just got my first dose of the Modern COVID-19 vaccination. Tiny needle, didn't feel a thing, and I'm feeling absolutely fine afterwards. Take *that*, you evil little bastard. #Moderna #COVID19Vaccine
0	It's shocking to me that eveneducated people can have such a poor understanding of basic math. If this person is a nurse I fear for the safety of the patients that he or she is giving medications to.
0	In today’s news Covid 19 vaccines are linked to a 2500 percent increased risk of early onset dementia. Good luck out there.
1	Those are side effects, I had side effects after my second dose too. They’re a lot more common after the second dose. Just because you had side effects from one vaccine doesn’t mean that you should stop getting them completely. I’ve been getting vaccines my whole life and the only side effect I get is a sore arm, which is supposed to happen. Heck, I’m currently on a vaccine keeping me alive right now.
0	Pass
1	Hope she doesn't die from something unrelated the next few weeks or people are going to go apeshit.
0	Short of putting a gun to a family members head i wasn't going to take the vaccine
1	I just took my first covid pfizer vaccine 4days ago. I didn’t feel anything except my arms being sore asf for 2 days like i just lifted weights but on my left arm. no headaches, no fever.. overall felt okay. My 2nd dose is next month so wish me luck! Hopefully it goes smoothly, i was legit nervous on my first one
1	A friend of mine just texted that he was at the symphony in DC last night and conductor announced Dr. Fauci was there, and the crowd gave Fauci a five-minute standing ovation. Love this. I've been vaxxed to the max, have never gotten covid and grateful for Faci.
1	if we could all get vaccinated - do the simple thing
0	I'm glad I trust my gut feeling, the pharma industry is absolutely evil. I have companies still denying me just because I'm unvaccinated, its crazy
0	o because people that are vaccinated get less symptoms and don’t know they have it so they spread it around at all their vac pass events!! 🤣 good luck when you find out the truth! The vaccine does not prevent the spread nOr does it prevent getting sick or even dying
1	I’m the only one in my office who got the latest booster. I’m also the only one in my office who has not had Covid even after being exposed to it.Get your booster, y’all. Unless you enjoy getting sick.
0	People still testing for COVID, is like an adult still looking under the bed for the boogeyman.
0	I am 42 years I haven't been vaccinated but my friends those who had been vaccinated facing heart' blockage problem
0	I never had any fever and flu even pre pandemic. Not until i had vaccinated with first dose of pfizer last week. The side effects took after 6 days from my vacvination. And its the worst ever. Im even thinking not getting my 2nd dose.
1	In my opinion, the COVID vaccine is a game-changer.
0	My mom got auto immune condition after vaccine of two doses. Our life has become hell.
1	It reduces the symptoms and chance of fatality not the spread.
0	Lol this is such horseshit. The bottom *among individuals who avoided infection thanks to other people’s vaccination. Except the vaccinated still get Covid because it’s a therapeutic not a vaccine.
1	Well done to all of the scientists and technicians who have made this happen. Silent heroes.
1	thank y'all for continuing to educate the public about covid!!
0	You need to check out the newly released information of the side effects is interesting especially considering all the people that have died.
1	It's hard to overstate how good vaccines are as a class of technology.  So much so that it's worth paying a lot just for a chance to get improvements a bit earlier!
0	People are waking up about vaccines. Why on earth would you let someone inject you with straight junk?!
1	New evidence confirms old evidence which confirmed first ever evidence.
1	One of the first vaccines receivers in the US. Momentous for science. Hope has arrived.#COVID19 #CovidVaccine
0	have been in perfect health all my life. But after I got the vaccine. My health has been steadily in decline.
0	My heart slowed to 37 beats per minute after the JnJ and was hospitalized for 2 days with no answers (or they weren't allowed to say). Under duress, I was forced to get vaxxed. "Get the jab, or lose your job of 24 years."
1	Huge thanks to the scientists and healthcare workers!
1	My Dad has it and has been vaccinated for several months. He is 87. If he had not been vaccinated his time here on the planet would be done. Stay safe
0	Why give it to the teenagers, if their survival rate is almost 99%?!??!! Its like if grandma has cancer , the whole family goes for chemo!
0	I was forced in order to keep my job. I waited until 2 weeks before the deadline hoping it would be postponed, but no. My RA flared and I had abdominal cramps and muscle pain for a long time, maybe 6 months or more. Ive felt ridiculously spacey or forgetful since I had it. Im still so mad and feel helpless.
1	The efficacy of each vaccine is determined by clinical trials, not by the strength of the vaccine.
0	This isn't up for debate. The government should absolutely NOT mandate this.
1	got both shots, nothing from the first, a temporary sore deltoid from the second. the feeling of relief was much bigger than the pain.
0	"Why do the protected need to be protected from the unprotected by forcing the unprotected to use the protection that didn't protect the protected in the first place?" - Unvaccinated 2021
1	Great news! Can't wait for my jab, thanks to all involved! :)
1	You are going to do great! You got this
1	Would be great if I could get it but my country has a failing health system and refuses to give boosters to most people.
0	I am a healthy 72 years old not vaccinated, and I had a Covid for the first time in early December 2022. First day body aches and very light fever, second day it was gone just was little tiered. Still was doing all my housework without any difficulties. 4 days later, I was back already on a golf course
0	My mother in law has deteriorated so bad constant headaches, rashes, and can’t remember Anything after her shots. Very active and mentally smart prior. Doctors deny it was jabs some nurses say opposite but afraid to say otherwise. I have zero trust in most doctors today
0	I don’t like how people vote, what does that have to do with anything? The vaccine mandates and requirements were based off of nothing scientific, the Covid ‘vaccine’ didn’t work to stop the spread, even when they said vaxed ppl can’t pass or get it again. But I’m dumb lol
1	I’m a public school teacher, I am 100% going to be taking a vaccine as soon as possible to make sure I don’t spread anything unintentionally to my students or colleagues. When we have the tools to stop suffering, we need to use them.
1	New research shows antivaxxers don't care about science... Or facts in general
0	And the Democrats call the Republicans sheep! How can anyone even think of getting another one of these shots with all that's came out about them.
1	I don’t think a nurse should be able to practice when they don’t believe in medical safety and science.
0	the live virus is not in the vaccine and I am not going to take a shot from the same people who created the virus in the first place.
1	Ignorance is the most dangerous epidemic
1	First shot done with minimal side effects. Vaccination is a responsible choice for a healthier society.
1	love to see you document this! didn't get mine yet but hopefully sometime soon! 🤍
0	I am an 68 year old woman. The last time I was hospitized was in 1960, right after the Polio vaccine , I developed Viral Encephalitis post Chicken Pox! I NEVER take the flu vaccine, rarely got the flu. If I did get the flu ,I treated it with Homeopathic remedies. I was a US Navy Nurse Corps scholarship student in college. I left nursing, got an Honorable Discharge and became a Special Education teacher for 37 years! When I retired from teaching I had 300 Unused Sick Days. I take ZERO prescription drugs. I use ONLY vitamins & some herbs. I am recovering from Covid-19. The very first time I ever got it! I have relatives who were vaxed and had Covid 19 three times!!!!! I didn't get vaxed! When I got Covid 19 , I was NEVER hospitized. I was given a drug to reduce nausea! I am recovering at home!
0	How do you know if the vaccine has taken effect? Is there a test to verify you have the anti bodies?
1	We need to teach kids how to find, read, and understand credible sources from all different media: websites, news publications, academic journals, etc.
1	Got my shot and feeling a sense of responsibility toward the community.
1	As soon as I'm able I'm going to get vaccinated.
0	I did not want the shots but was forced as a nurse. Got the first two Pfizer and got horribly ill. Refused the boosters and have been harassed over it. It’s been two years and I’m living with side effects from it. Extreme fatigue, vision issues, and heart
1	collective immunity from vaccines; all people vaccinated: means those at greater risk from the disease get protected; you pay your taxes, right? might as well contribute
1	Leave it to the Germans to get shit done
0	Thank you for speaking the truth.  And to the unvaccinated...we salute you
1	Thank you Biontech and Pfizer. Your passion for science and concern for humanity are reflected in your immense efforts to produce this vaccine. Much respect and admiration for your work!
0	I'm just over 50 unjabbed and no way on earth am I ever having this crap injected in me....
0	was told by my childs cardiologist to get us all vaccinated to protect him! I'm beyond furious! He was fine , but we're still suffering side effects!
0	Excuse me, but I don't appreciate being treated like a walking petri dish for experimental medications.
1	I’m 14 days after my 2nd pfeizer dose. I had a sore arm as side effects. No biggie.
0	What is in syringe? We don’t know
1	I believe in the power of science and the incredible work of healthcare professionals. Getting vaccinated is a crucial step in ending the pandemic and returning to a sense of normalcy. Let's do our part!
0	What do you say to my Pakistani 36 year old friend who lost his brother to myocarditis or my 31 year Filipino friend who’s doctor told her not to get the COVID vaccine while pregnant. The individual risk profile is personal yet Trudeau mandated mandatory vaccination for them
0	I havent had covid since 2021. Im unvaccinated and yet, all these vaccinated people I work with. Are catching covid yearly, sometimes 2 or 3 times a year. 😂 I love the extra hours from always covering their shifts. Just got 95.6 hours on this last paycheck covering extra shits.
1	I got the 3 shots and I didn't get sick any time. I'm from Brazil. Here the vaccination was slow at the beginning, but now we are almost finishing!
0	I'm now almost 3 weeks out from 2nd dose, had symptoms since 1st dose on 2/24. Last post I made was about 1 week post 2nd dose. I can say that while I still have constant rocking vertigo, I am far more functional today and feel better. The severe nausea and fatigue has eased up a bit. I can drive some. Taking care of my kids is doable. I still have the constant feeling that I'm on a boat, my pulse races periodically for no reason, my legs and arms feel weak, and I still have some brain fog. Seeing PCP Wednesday, will most likely see an ENT soon, maybe begin some vestibular pt. I tried Vit C, Ibuprofen, etc. Seems like the only thing that helped was time. I still regret rolling the dice and getting the 2nd dose. I will not be getting any booster in the future. Sending you all good vibes. Does anyone else have rocking vertigo, rather than the spins?
1	Protect yourself and others too. Get vaccinated.
1	What do you mean “it is clearly anything but”?  The Covid vaccines were highly effective and extraordinarily safe. Without them we would have seen far far more death and illness. A handful of sad edge cases does not counteract the overwhelming data backing this up.
1	Never crosses their selfish minds that other people with different diseases, accidents etc. are also dying because of them.
0	Avoid the clot shot
1	Long term vaccine reactions are very rare. If you read people’s “experiences” on Reddit, you will think these are common, but they are not.
0	Lots of unknowns with this vaccine. Hesitant.
1	I just got the first dose and made my appointment for my second dose in April! Im so excited.
0	You vaccinated sheep
1	pfizer u win!!!!!
0	What Jeremiah 17:5 looks like; Cursed be anyone that trusts in man (invention 💉💉💊🥼🧪) and makes flesh his arm, and whose heart departs from YHWH (THE CREATOR of all living things).
0	I'm glad I trust my gut feeling, the pharma industry is absolutely evil. I have companies still denying me just because I'm unvaccinated, its crazy
0	Currently weekly we are hearing of people getting strokes, heart problems and other sicknesses. These people had no prior diagnosis of illnesses but it is interesting to note that is the vaccinated who have been affected.
0	I never got vaccinated, I got Covid 3 times. I had chronic asthma and my Doctor told me if I didn’t get vaccinated I was going to die. I have never felt so great in my 40 years of chronic asthma till now, I have not used my inhaler for the last 11 months. I trust God and I knew that I didn’t need to get vaccinated or probably won’t be here to tell my blessings.
0	Never wore a mask, never stayed home and still unvaccinated. I was 100% guaranteed to die because I didn't play along but 3 years later I'm aok
0	The first vaccine put me in the hospital for three weeks, almost killed me, and permanently affected my health. I’ll never take an untested experimental drug again, especially to avoid a cold.
1	These people don't want to get vaccinated, won't wear a mask and won't maintain social distance. They are arrogant!!!
1	We’re not brainwashed. We’re just able to do basic risk analysis. Almost all Covid deaths now are unvaccinated people. The vaccines clearly work.
0	Dr. Campbell, sincere thanks for posting this important health information. I have lost six friends in 2022 to repercussions from the quackcines. All were willingly double-jabbed and boostered. Another friend who is fully vaxxed has now developed sleep apnea and A-Fib, whereas before 2021 she was very healthy, active and rarely ill.
1	Just imagine being the pro-vaccine doctor who probably has 15+ years of studying, looking at countless studies, and practicing medicine only for a wine mom with zero understanding of medicine to tell you "you're wrong."
1	Because of narrow-minded stupidity, thousands upon thousands die of Covid in the USA.  Even TFG has admitted that vaccination saves lives.
1	#Vaccinated  Please get vaccinated as soon as you possibly can.   Let’s end this together, one vaccine at a time.   #Jabbed #COVID19India
1	all this talk about side effects but honestly, my experience was smooth, nothing to worry about
0	Whenever a nurse told me I had no choice and she wanted to force me to get a shot that told me everything I needed to know. Thanks to her I've never had a shot since.
1	I got my pfizer vaccine - now I can edit my S.P.E.C.I.A.L.
0	Get the dirty vax off the market!!
0	I've read reports of people experiencing severe side effects after the vaccine. How are these cases being monitored and addressed?
0	Feeling like questioning vaccines gets you labele
1	Anecdotal case in point for me. I’m triple Moderna. Started feeling run down on Friday. Tested positive on Saturday. Pretty mild cold otherwise. I’m sure if I wasn’t vaxxed the symptoms would have been more severe.
0	Studying vaccine development prior to the COVID outbreak gave me all the information I needed to refuse the new vaccines.
0	My heart said no; my head said no. I said yes to my instinct and said no to the 'vaccine'. Happy and healthy.
1	Vaccination is compulsory for everyone because of Covid
0	'It's easier to fool people than to convince them that they have been fooled' -Mark Twain. You, guys, have been fooled.
0	This is utterly outrageous, to put a needle in my skin and injecting some unknown substance in my body is a big fucking no for me!
1	Got the vaccine..very emotional moment..being a healthcare worker .believe in God that gave wisdom to those scientists. Thank you Pysier
0	#Florida surgeon general explains why he is concerned about #mRNA #COVID19 #vaccines
0	The death rates from the death jab are mounting. To cover up the responsibility of the “vaccine,” a new virus will be released to take the blame for the deaths
1	I would be so disappointed as a father if my child became an anti-vaxxer
1	I got sick with covid this fall while waiting for the updated booster.As a healthy 30 year old male I was still on my ass for a week. It wasn't close to lethal or anything, but I would still opt for the sore arm any day.Even assuming you won't die it doesn't make sense to skip the booster, being sick still sucks.
1	Vaccinate your kids or they will die of unvaccination :v
0	The amount of relief I feel that I didn't get vaccinated, even though I was pressured by almost every member of my family, is absolutely indescribable! I feel sorry for those who got it though. Best of luck, they're definitely gonna need it.
0	I am unvaxxed and had Covid, was running 12 kms the next day. Best friend has covid triple vaxxed and so so ill. Vaccine is shite
1	Even if you had COVID, medical experts are saying get the vaccine.
0	I am unvaccinated and don't have any regrets.
0	so you're telling me my immune system is basically a superhero who destroyed the city just to find the villain?
1	I will get it once they it is safe for me(for reasons at the time they say its not) and I want to see the long term effects. I will get it though!!
0	I thought my side effects were coincidence as well (perhaps early menopause despite no family history of that). But then all the side effects happened the same way and in the same time frame when I got the second dose...only worse. I couldn't leave the house for a month straight. I've otherwise had all my other vaccines and boosters, yet I am not allowed to be critical of Pfizer or tell my story without being shamed.
0	Remember when all your friends and anyone you met all they could talk about is if you got your VAX yet and if you said no they would not leave you alone. I am so happy I never got one.
1	And yet I could name 100 people who got the vaccine and are just fine. I don’t know anyone hurt by the vaccine.
0	Get rid of that vaccine. It's not a vaccine.
0	Go ahead & try to force it on us & see what happens won't be good!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1	Was reading up on vaccine stats, and it's actually reassuring. If we can manage to get a good chunk of the population vaccinated, the impact will be huge. Plus, it's outperforming the flu vaccine, and that's saying something!
1	Can you give the general public any idea how long it takes to make the vaccines once the scientists make the formula?
1	I just received the 1st of the vaccine.  I’m crying with joy!!
1	I love how you make this information so accessible and easily understandable for lay people. This is so much easier to understand than all the charts and stats. You’re doing great work. Science!
1	"As a teacher, I want to create a safer environment for my students. That's why I support and got the vaccine."
0	By not taking the jab, I'm 100% safe from side effects and 99% safe from covid.
0	The amount of relief I feel that I didn't get vaccinated, even though I was pressured by almost every member of my family, is absolutely indescribable! I feel sorry for those who got it though. Best of luck, they're definitely gonna need it.
0	Of course we can’t blame the “vaccine” but it’s ok to blame the dead victim
0	Proudly unvaccinated, my dating standards are going to be kept that way; unvaccinated only
1	Received my 2nd dose at @DWTCOfficial today! That means I can officially say, I GOT VACCINATED!
0	Never regretted not getting that shot.
1	Have contracted covid 3 times. First time was before it was really diagnosed and vaccines weren't available. Got it last year and am in quarantine right now just having gotten through it. The vaccine doesn't prevent covid, it lessens the intensity. It's gotten less severe each time.
0	WEAR A MASK TO PREVENT GETTING COVID IN THE FIRST PLACE.

0	WHY would a parent think it's ok to vaccinate a child, knowing that there's a strong chance of side effects and reaction?????
0	FDA needs to be dismantled - has not had a moral compass for decades
0	Just because one may not get symptoms right away does not mean you won't get symptoms later on. Please be wise in your decision.
1	Vaccines are like the unsung heroes, quietly stopping diseases in their tracks. Solid defense for sure.
1	Obvious benefits aside, vaccinations for.my kids might mean they need extra cuddles later and that's also never a bad thing lol.
0	Those i know who took the jabs became ill, those i know that didn't take any jabs have never been ill.
1	Zero issues with the vaccine
1	Done with my vaccine doses. Simple, safe, and a step closer to putting an end to this pandemic
0	Wow so basically their injecting you with the virus water salt and sugar wow no thank you iv been good this far just living my life I don't even get the flu shot
1	Thanks to the efforts of the scientific community, we can get vaccinated. Unfortunately, there are still inequalities in this world. While the US bought vaccine doses for its entire population, some countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America couldn’t. I believe Europe and the USA should help those places because no one is safe until the whole world is.
1	Good to hear. hopefully news continues to be positive. Just hope people get vaccinated, or it's made a requirement to return to work, especially in certain professions (health care, education)  Nothing will be 100%, but 90% is good for herd immunity if everyone gets vaccinated and takes it seriously.
0	"I'm waiting for more research on potential side effects before considering vaccination."
1	IF YOU WANT TO BE IN A FIELD THAT CARE'S FOR THE ill, THEN GET VACCINATED OR OUT OF HEALTH CARE
0	The only thing you need to know- DON’T TAKE IT!
0	Those people used to say that vaccines will be free but now trying to make profit out of them. They’ll even get taxes.
1	Getting vaccinated is an investment in the health and well-being of our society. It's a small sacrifice for a big reward – a world where we can all live without the constant threat of COVID-19
0	There are a lot of things on the internet that people are posting on how to detox your body and get rid of the negative things that they put into those vaccines
1	The school I work for just reclosed because students are getting sick. The first covid strain didn’t seem to effect kids very often, one of these new strains is. Please get the vaccine if you can!
0	As a pharmacist, having serious concerns from the outset, I am ashamed of my profession. I was so proud to have worked in the NHS for 30 years, not any more. This is worse than the Tamiflu debacle and has the MHRA forgotten about Thalidomide?
0	I saw 99.9999% of doctors and scientist world wide believe that it was safe, but I’m going to go with the 0.0001% that align with my hatred and beliefs instead.
1	I'm so grateful for vaccines. And so glad that new techniques are making them more effective and faster to make!
1	i took pfizer im not dead
1	, I think it's a superior vaccine
1	I just got my first vaccine today. No side effects so far. Thank you to all the scientists and researchers around the world for making the vaccine available this early and thank you for this channel for spreading the science. Yes, it’s definitely OK to be smart. Science rules!!!!
0	>Ok so what ARE the (scientifically proven) risks of vaccinating?   Death, seizures, comas, allergic reactions, meningitis, encephalitis, immunocompromised disorders, and so many other things I couldn't fit here. The vaccine companies literally admit all these things on the inserts and labels.  Now, it's unknown how rare these things are, but there is some good suggestive evidence to say that it's not as rare as made out to be.  &#x200B;  >Are there any actually documented cases of of kids or even adults dying  or almost dying in which it was ACTUALLY linked to vaccines?   &#x200B;  Hannah poling: She was confirmed to have been injured by vaccines, and the doctor who did so, who used to be pro vax hard, was not allowed to perform evaluations for a while, isn't that interesting? It's like they didn't like what he found out.  &#x200B;  [https://www.ageofautism.com/2010/09/government-awards-hannah-poling-15-million-in-vaccine-injury-case.html](https://www.ageofautism.com/2010/09/government-awards-hannah-poling-15-million-in-vaccine-injury-case.html)  &#x200B;  VAERS, yellow card and other vaccine compensation programs report 400 deaths per year from vaccines, in the U.S alone. And many more cases of injuries.  VAERS is CDC sponsored too.  &#x200B;  There is commonalities between the vast majority of the cases reported, such as seizures, comas, sudden change in behaviour, intense unusual screaming, floppy arms and legs, development in walking speaking and communicating being hindered greatly, inability to smile, laugh, talk, and do many things.   These commonalities are very suggestive of there being a vaccine relationship, as these are all reported soon after getting vaccinated.   &#x200B;  > If so how many was it in comparison to all the other vaccinated children who were completely fine?   &#x200B;  Using the avaliable information, which isn't ideal, an educated reasonable guess would be that, in the U.S, in an average year, (I can't find any data to show how many kids are vaccinated every year) 10,000 kids each year get seriously injured from vaccines, 2,000 almost die, 1,000 die.   &#x200B;  When we look at measles, before 1963 3,000,000 people per year in the U.S got measles, (roughly, although we don't know how good the diagnosis' were) out of these cases, 500 died, 5,000 got seriously injured.   &#x200B;  That's in the 50's and 60's!   &#x200B;  The data speaks for itself.
1	Vaccine = fighting chance against COVID. Happy to be vaxxed.
0	Lucky for me I get to hear all about the medical charts my wife codes. I’m way more afraid of the vaccine than getting covid.
0	Don't let babies get any shots at all. My best friend's 3 month old just died.
1	The covid vax is a miracle of modern medicine. When something so miraculous is invented, ppl always have misgivings. They think it's too good to be true. Although in this case it is. It's human nature to hesitate. & Ppl have a tendency to be distracted by conspiracy theories!!
1	ya boy got got BUT luckily that vaccine+booster made it so my symptoms have been the most minimal they could be
0	So if the jabs are superior why are people having a third jab in a year? Wake up
0	Because it’s completely unnecessary unless you’re legitimately high risk. No one is getting that shot.
1	As a healthcare worker, this is the first time I’ve heard anyone say they would get a vaccine to help me and it made me feel more things than I though it would. Thank you Hank.
0	Would that not warrant at a look into? The cdc is so full of shit it stinks to high heaven.
0	Really wish they’d change the narrative on Covid vaccines. It has taken a worrying turn towards compulsory vaccination and I think that’s a big mistake. Missing a lot of transparency. Ps I’m defo not anti-vax.
1	As someone who has taken graduate level immunology, I find it disheartening to see this comments section rife with misinformation.  Vaccinations are essential for a large, healthy population. Those against vaccinations are experiencing the luxury of herd immunity from those who have vaccinations.  The additives in vaccines are often used to inactivate or preserve the vaccinations with upmost efficiency. Some vaccines do have risks; however, the pros of vaccinating far outweigh the cons of not doing so.
1	i have asthma, and i’m really concerned that if i got the virus before being vaccinated, i would get seriously hurt. i was of the first people in line as soon as i could get it, because as much as i hate myself, i would prefer not to die like that.
1	Proud to be part of the global effort to end the pandemic. Got my flu shot and COVID booster—double protection!  #VaxxedAndProud
1	Seeing the decline in cases after vaccinations began gives me hope.
1	This is now a code blue thread. Antivaxxers are not welcome. You can leave or we can make you leave.
1	Pope Francis suggested on Monday that getting vaccinated against the coronavirus was a “moral obligation" and denounced how people has been swayed by ”baseless information” to refuse one of the most effective measure to save lives
1	Vaccination is a civic duty to contribute to public health and community well-being.
1	So thankful for the vaccine. Feels like a turning point.
1	Vaccine feels like a light at the end of a long tunnel.
1	Vaccines save lives. I got mine to not only safeguard myself but also to contribute to the greater good. Together, we can overcome this global challenge
1	Fully vaccinated against covid! Grateful for the opportunity to protect myself, others and a small community
0	I got jabbed, I got covid.... effective????????
0	Shocking the division within our communities this is causing... Stop labelling the people that want more proof "Anti Vaxxers"
1	Yeah more boosters can we have one every month please?
0	I'm worried about the long-term side effects of the vaccine since it was developed so quickly.
1	Getting my 2nd Pfizer on Friday. Thanks for the heands up.
1	Getting vaccinated is not just for you, but for protecting those who can't get the vaccine.
0	The pressure I endured from friends and some family members was unrelenting. But I knew deep down this was dangerous! I was prepared to walk away from every relationship and determined to stand my ground. Two of my friends developed aggressive cancers who were otherwise very healthy. One family member is suffering from heart issues. I fully expect to be at a lot of funerals in the near future. But the best thing about Covid is it taught me just how evil our own government is. I will NEVER trust our government or the pharmaceutical industry, again! Rest assured I’m not the only one.
0	The US has a picture perfect vaccination program, its called Omicron. You're welcome, the headlines will read, Covid killed by the common cold, the world got vaccinated and no shots were needed lol
0	I'm not convinced that COVID-19 is as serious as they say. I don't see the need for a vaccine.
0	They are all poison!!
0	Our woke corporate leaders will behave like sheep and cower to any demands by the HoJo Administration. Companies have already indicated that they will mandate vaccines.
0	Greed &; stupidity at highest levels of government are now killing people &; we can't fix it now. Could we have actually corralled #Covid19? Yup! All #Trump needed to do was to swallow false pride.
1	Side effects: reaching adulthood, not dying , chance of not getting sick
0	What’s wrong with waiting a little bit to see the effects of this new vaccine? Nothing wrong with doing some due diligence first
0	I've heard of kids getting sick after vaccines. Coincidence? I think not.
1	Big pharma covering up the fact that 90% of the population died suddenly two years ago.
0	Doesn't matter I'm not getting any of them, haven't gotten any of them still alive
0	I am delighted that I never got the injections which don't prevent you getting sick or transmitting the virus.
1	I just got my vaccine taken and I'm feeling good , I don't feel any side effects , smooth process it was
0	“We won’t put anything in our body if we don’t know where it comes from” snorts coke
0	If a fertility is going to be effected by the vaccine then the public should have be told before vaccinating half the world ,also if fertility is an issue how can they expect us to vaccinate our children and Rob them from having a family of there own
0	I had my first jab yesterday but I've been nauseous and weak ever since plus got a running stomach. As someone that hasn't fallen sick on a decade this sucks.
1	Any parent who decides not get their kids vaccinated should be prosecuted. It should be a criminal offense.
1	Am I vaccinated today? You bet I am. I am so grateful
1	"The best decision! Vaccines have saved lives for over 100 years!! They are the best technology ever created! Greetings."
0	All cap. Could have seen her solution from another planet. The experimental joy juice. Safe and effective..... yeah riggggght! What are they on now , the 8th or 9th shot!
1	Leigh Williams Nope, those using mRNA and dna vaccines will tweak your cells to developed anti bodies.
1	Thankful for the vaccine  as it reduced the severity
1	Dr. Wen, you're right. People don't understand what vaccines do, and don't do. Because vaccines against some diseases, particularly the "childhood illnesses," have been so effective, many people think vaccines are either perfectly protective or useless. The truth is somewhere in between.
1	I was starting to feel silly with my post graduate studies  in science and research, and not being vaccinated. But now I know I made the right choice.
1	My baby was eligible when they released it for 6mos + she literally got it the day it was available. Infant mortality is dramatically decreased since vaccines were invented. She will get every vaccine I don’t care. My mom didn’t let my sis get the HPV vaccine bc of her purity beliefs. Guess who got HPV? Also hold the line on your beliefs. We didn’t let anyone see our baby unless they were vaxxed and masked. There is A LOT of shit going around right now.
0	I had 3 perfectly healthy active friends die from heart attack shortly after the jabs.
0	not getting jabbed is dangerous for big pharma's shareholders
0	Long covid is very much the same as the adverse reactions I had to forced flu shots. It took 7 yrs to recover from 4 forced shots because I worked on health care.
1	I just got my second shot today! Feeling very thankful.
0	Health does not come from a needle. Nutrition, sunshine, and hygiene is pretty miraculous.
1	Moderna or Pfizer are the best. I have received my third Moderna shot about 5 weeks ago and I’m so glad that I did.  So far my DNA hasn’t changed and none of my bodily features haven’t mutated into anything. The anti-vaxxers should be deported to Mars. We would be much better without them.  Anyway, get vaccinated as soon as possible.
0	I'm glad I trust my gut feeling, the pharma industry is absolutely evil. I have companies still denying me just because I'm unvaccinated, its crazy
0	I know about 12 people in my small town who dropped dead of heart attacks and blood clots after those shots , all under 55, how’s that for data .  My cousins kid got ALS right after getting that shot, poor kid, 32 and just got married. Had his whole life
0	I still have the vibrating in my chest 1 year after getting Moderna vaccine. I had and still have numbness and tingling in my legs, sever chest pain, rapid heart rate, and the inability to swallow at times. I literally thought I was going to die. People should be warned of these horrible, life altering affects these drugs can have on your nervous system
1	Ninety percent efficacy? That's stellar. Remember when we were just hoping for something over fifty? Science is amazing.
0	Yep and I won’t ever get it again!
1	You know what's different between Jim Crowe laws and vaccine only dining? You can affect your vaccination status.
1	From the UK just got my first dose today. Apart from my arm hurting a fair amount been feeling pretty fine. My Body is finally augmented for windows 11 thanks bill!
1	Let's have high hopes that it will work in the mighty name of Jesus
1	This cost my father his life, and possibly saved several of his friend's lives. On his death bed, he told me he regretted not getting the vaccine, that he just believed everything that was being pumped into his brain from right-wing media. I don't know if he even thought it was real before he was infected. He told his friends the same things, and at least the ones we met while dealing with his estate all got vaccinated. Been a little over a year since he passed, and man...it really hits me sometimes.
1	The sooner we all get vaccinated, the sooner we can return to normal activities like traveling, attending events, and visiting loved ones without fear.
0	I have gotten my 2 shots of Johnny walker today also and I feel great now I want to fight a big lion bare hands
0	No  too much information about the dangers of the vaccine. Under reported side effects and  deaths from the vaccine. 2 people I know died and several injured from the vaccine  .
1	2 years ago I recently moved to Orange County from Texas and it was STILL a shock for me to see people in California be this anti-vax/mask. I even saw nurses protesting the mandate outside of their hospital. That’s not something you’d even see in the major metros of Texas.
0	Took first shot n have irregular heartbeat and chest pain. I regret it n never going to take again even at gunpoint.
0	The largest clinical trial experiment ever conducted in the history of the planet. My reason to not vaccinate, informed consent.
0	Kudos to all the uninjected!
0	There have been repeated warnings on the horrors of since well over a century But the "public" has an astonishingly short memory span when it comes to such critical matters & the game just continues with no end in sight
0	I am remaining unvaxxed. At all cost that is important.
0	Oddly most of the Elite and Politian's are NOT vaxxed. also most officials arrested and sent to Gitmo are NOT vaxxed.
0	The amount of relief I feel that I didn't get vaccinated, even though I was pressured by almost every member of my family, is absolutely indescribable! I feel sorry for those who got it though. Best of luck, they're definitely gonna need it.
0	Breakthrough infections got me questioning the whole point of getting vaccinated. What's the deal?
1	I had my vaccinations as a kid and im still here because of them i dintnunderstand why people are acting like this is such a new thing theres vaccines that save lives
0	I’m unvaccinated, first time since Covid started I had a day where I had a body ache & headache. Didn’t have a running nose, no fever, no cough. I slept 24 hours. Today I feel perfect, like nothing happened.
1	I had nightmares that I was going to die alone on a respirator. This vaccine insure that will not happen.
0	There is no debate over safety if long term studies have not been done. You can't call it safe, in fact its hugely irresponsible and liable claims should be filed against those who say its safe without any long term effects data available. If its safe then allow Phizer etc to be sued over any future adverse effects.
0	That’s really swell but I will take a pass on the vaccine.
1	Just left the urologist and apparently the CoVID vaccination tripled my sperm count and increased my motility?!?
1	Wubba Lubba Dub-Dub! The vaccine is here!
1	What’s worrisome is the anti-vaxer States giving rise to variants that are immune to the vaccine. Then people will say, you see, it didn’t work, but taking the data of average deaths from 1st and 2nd waves.  3rd wave death and hospitalisation decreased by vaccines
0	Does it protect you? Not one bit. Just the opposite.
0	LMAO they keep telling themselves that (no one was forced). Tell that to the millions of people who had to make a choice between getting the vax or getting FIRED.
0	The government shouldn't force us to inject something into our bodies against our will.
0	DO NOT TAKE THE VACCINE.
1	Thank you! Also here in France they're saying the vaccine reduces transmission against delta by about 50 percent. That is reducing 1 out of 2 infections!
1	"I want to be part of the solution and help bring an end to the suffering caused by the pandemic."
1	There’s a vastly increased chance of heart issues from having had Covid than there is from the vaccine.
1	Nice to see doctors that consistently call out lies and disinformation. Over the last 4 years this I find is unfortunately rare.
1	I've been told countless times how often I should have died as of today. Just got my 4th shot 1 month ago. All is fine and over 1 year now from the first one. First it was a few days I should have died. Then weeks, them months, 1 year and so on. The Goalpost are moving as time is moving.
1	the best time to get the vaccine
1	someone i worked with who was the same kind of person (from a rural area, working class) and he was under the impression that vaccinated people were “actually more likely to die from covid than unvaccinated people” so he wouldn’t get it…
1	Just got my second #Moderna #COVID19 shot. It was empty Thursday opens to everyone. Go #GetVaccinated #CovidVaccine #COVID19Vaccination It's everybody's turn now.
0	Thank GOD I didn’t get jabbed. Feel terrible for all the trusting individuals who thought they were doing the responsible thing. So sad
1	As a pediatrician, I am so relieved that COVID vaccine will be available in the next week or two for children age 5-11.
1	You know, some of us made the effort to prevent you from taking the "vaccines". Now, I encourage you! Go for it! Get ten booster shots! A better world for the rest of us!
0	When your country is populated with idiots, this is the best you can do.
0	Maybe it has long terms effects that are actually worse than COVID.
1	The experience of vaccination became a shared narrative, connecting individuals across different walks of life.
0	What about the blood clots? Or the infertility from the vaccine?
1	The SPIKE PROTEIN is NOT harmless.
1	When you don’t believe in Covid and blame Covid deaths on vaccines of course you are going to say that
1	Before I got any of my COVID vaccines, the nurse explained the risks, what to look for and gave me a pamphlet.I’m not listening to Maher or MacFarlane about it because they don’t know what they are talking about.
1	“I would wax my chin for a Covid vaccine” lol I wish I had a vaccine every time I had to wax my face
1	If you haven't been infected by the virus, it's better to get vaccinated to prevent serious problems or death if you become infected.
1	the whole point of vaccines is that they basically make you sick with COVID-19 just without any symptoms, so getting a vaccine is as good as getting sick. I personally don't expect COVID-19 to go away, I think it will just become the new seasonal flu for which you have to get vaccinated anually.
0	I lost my job for declining the vaccine.
1	Tens of thousands and putting strain on our healthcare resources. Get vaccinated.
1	Great get it in my arm already
0	I did not get the clot shot. The surgeon general of my state came out saying the shot is linked to blood clots and heart failure. I’m so glad I listened to my instincts and not the doctors trying to force me to take it.
1	I just got my first vaccine today. No side effects so far. Thank you to all the scientists and researchers around the world for making the vaccine available this early and thank you for this channel for spreading the science. Yes, it’s definitely OK to be smart. Science rules!!!!
1	Still fine here after being double vaxxed with Pfizer and a survivor of covid in 2020
0	This is obviously the reaction of competent, rightful and confident people who are taking care of everything. Or maybe is what we can all expect from every politician who got their cut in the covid and vaccine scam, and that is a pretty high percentage. They will run away like rats and hide until the shit has stop hitting the fan, because people let them. But this, along with the silicon valley bank collapse, the EU green policies, the constant migration issues, the war on resources between Russia and the West, infrastructure collapse in the US which alongside the vaccine and the economical effects of the lockdown have probably worsened the general public's health, and the CCP lurking its way into this disaster while under cover, is a sign things are starting to get worse pretty soon.
0	They better not think about in injecting me and mine with that shite. That's how we get zombies
1	If not vaccinated, do it. I can't imagine how bad this would have been without the vaccine.
1	Get your vaccine, kids.
1	I got the booster yesterday and feel great! No side effects!
1	The amout of antivaxxers in here is disgusting
1	Got my COVID Vaccine today...Covid19 a serious Virus... Time to get serious about the Vaccine
0	CDC: Please explain Colin Powell and others who have died after being fully vaccinated.
0	I had so many family members try to tell me that I was reason that COVID persisted because of not getting vaccinated. They are not saying that now.
0	I don't think we can gain more benefit than side effects from vaccination.
1	The vacine did done good to all of my family
0	If 90% hospitalized in UK were not boosted by vaccinated - does it mean that covid19 vaccination weakens your immune system against covid ? And does it mean you will need booster after booster - became covid vax junkie? #covid19
1	It will be my wife’s decision, but I will take the boosters and vaccines and she has followed my example this year. In the past she did not take the flu vaccine but since COVID’s appearance, she has been taking the flu vaccines as well–likely because these vaccines are brought to our door in our senior living place. Neither of us had flu or covid.
0	I mean, they're mainstream. They're just going to say what the government wants them to say. I'm not an idiot.
1	Omg, like yeah, definitely gonna trust the random conspiracy theory over, like, actual medical science and experts 😂🙄#sarcasm #vaccineswork #trustscience
1	he vaccine is a crucial step towards ending the pandemic.
0	My mom suddenly died from a major stroke after having her C-19 shots. She was in perfect health prior too.
1	Vaccines are very new medically speaking long after all major religions have been established. Why would they have something against vaccinations?
1	wear a mask, stay distanced and get vaxxed
0	I vowed not to accept any vaccine pushed through by the Trump administration. I’ll let his idiots be the guinea pigs.
1	death is a side effect of life, and its not possible, itd mandatory :p But it is coming MUCH SOONER for those who are not vaccinated.
1	I've had 6 covid vaccines. No side effects and when I actually got covid i got paxlovid and it was nothing. Sore throat and stuffy head was it.
0	BBC and most msm block the Truth. The Fact Checkers are all owned by the globalists and therefore they decide that anything that goes against their agenda is false information. I mean how crazy is it for anyone to question a jab that is supposed to protect us all against a virus with 99.98% survival rate, that was rushed through trials, has not had FDA Approval is not licensed or insured and took less than a year to get out as opposed to the usual 5 or 10 years....I mean ....to question that! Must be a tin hat wearer eh?
0	I have a cousin who works for a Large Pharmacy & they "forced" him to get the jab & he complied. He got covid 2 days later & had to get hospitalised. I hear (since I stopped talking to All my family over this roni) he's at his home waiting for disability. Be well.
0	I also have always had normal blood pressure and heart rate until having Moderna shot. For me though I had high blood pressure while simultaneously having low heart rate OR I would have high heart rate while simultaneously having low blood pressure. For this reason I could not take blood pressure med for fear of dropping whichever value was too low already, even lower. I had equilibrium issues but no room spinning, falling once. I’m obviously not a doctor but just think you should monitor your heart rate and bp at home and should one be extremely low while the other high, contact your doctor who put you on the blood pressure meds and let him know that. By the end of the 3rd week, after my first shot, these issues had stopped for me without medication. I did not get the 2nd shot.
0	Just think on all the rats we save buy testing humans first.
1	"my child had an adverse reaction to a vaccine, so they can't be vaccinated" So... Shouldn't you be advocating for others to vaccinate to stimulate herd immunity to protect your child?
0	Having a Patreon account or a YouTube channel does not make you a public health expert. If you're encouraging debate on dewormer vs vaccination for covid, you're as bad as the proverbial person who shouts "Fire!" in a crowded theater. This is not silly flat Earth debate.
1	Neutral. Just like every other vaccine I've gotten in my life.
1	I am so looking forward to them! My child will get them because of autoimmune problems and I will get them because I am the immune shield for my child.
0	It may be too early to say the vaccines are unsafe but it is too early to say they are safe too. Normally it takes at least a decade to develop a vaccine, and this mRNA vaccines are something totally new to us, so who knows? What do you know? I’d like to wait and see for at least a decade.
0	There's plenty of ways to stay healthy other than just getting a shot. Vitamins, water, healthy foods, exercises, and sleep. Don't just do what you're told, regardless of who's telling you.
0	The only thing that is not declining with these jabs is the deaths and side effects!
1	Vaccine and hope are two words I'd never put together
1	When can we go back to normal? Right after people understand they need to get vaccinated
0	During a vaccination session: Patient: Does it guarantee immunity ? Doctor: Only for the manufacturers.
1	I don't get how antivaxxers can possibly claim to love their children if they won't vaccinate them.
1	Remember it's not just the deaths, it's the potentially worse outcomes of the disease. It's the permanent damage that covid could cause to bodies which is also significantly lowered by the vaccine.
1	Just imagine being the pro-vaccine doctor who probably has 15+ years of studying, looking at countless studies, and practicing medicine only for a wine mom with zero understanding of medicine to tell you "you're wrong."
0	Why is he not talkimg about the side effects . He works for Gates or what....staying unvaccinated , not taking that poison.
0	Really hesitant about getting the vaccine. Still doing my research
0	All of the anti-vaxxers out there I've got one message for all of you I salute you keep up the good work
0	No vaccine ever needs to be mandated. Lets put our think caps on.
0	How’s the myocarditis shot doing for you? Lol
0	I’m definitely not gonna be the first Guinea pig to have it done lol
0	Tested positive three weeks ago and had to quarantine for what was essentially a mild cold.   Completely ridiculous.
1	Finally, I get to say this, Got #Jabbed  You should too,, go and get it done :)) It's all starts by completing your responsibility to save the world by getting vaccinated?!! #vaccinated #vaccine #COVID19 #COVIDVaccination
1	It's fine, go get your jab. I got mine already.
1	I’m about to get vaccine #4 next week. I can still do my uphill sprints and I have no 5G or mark of the beast.
1	I feel like i have covid again right now, i can only do minimal movements and my mind is floating. This is crazy but i know this vaccine will be really helpful to protect myself
1	I didnt have any side effects
0	But he didn't, previously, when he had the chance. And then he killed a bunch of us that were stupid enough to take his rushed-through vaccine. He functioned as a fully-vested employee of Pfizer, not the President of a free people. He has some apologizing to do if he is to be trusted again.
1	Yes
0	I should be fine, I'm going on my 200th booster! A little dizzy from severe myocarditis, but my iron lung should take care of the rest!
1	Is this a joke. Spanish flu in 1918 killed 20 million ppl worldwide, maybe more. The flu every year kills about 646k ppl. It's why we bother with flu vaccine. The regularity at which flu kills is the metric being referenced and COVID19 has a higher death rate like in 1918.
1	Stephanie. I hope and pray you recover.  You look so very sick. Thank you for finding enough breath and strength to tell people to get vaccinated.   God Bless you sweetheart  Annabella,  Bit the bullet  AND. finally Double Vaccinated  !  Melbourne, Australia 🙃
1	We trust vaccines, we care if we are healthy and we and our loved ones are with us for as long as possible. #VaccinesWork
0	"The laboratory itself and the governments that accept this are guilty."
0	Vaccines are safe he says I know 6 people who died within 3 months of getting the viper Loads of others have had strokes
0	Let's be honest; most doctors knew this vaccine was dangerous a couple of years ago. Doctors need to begin speaking out. Better late than never.
1	It's free, you can give the virus to someone else who isn't healthy and 27 and they might die from it, it does kill some healthy 27 year olds, more people with the vaccine mean less spread, less spread means less chance it mutates and becomes more deadly.
0	I consider not getting a COVID vaccination one of the healthiest decisions I've made, right up there with quitting smoking cigarettes.
1	The vaccine is very clever, and it's essential everyone that can have it does.
1	Everybody acts like this is some novel idea, but I worked in a nursing home for a few years and we all had to have flu vaccines every year because we were working with an at-risk population (and that's fairly standard; I don't think we were anomalous in that regard). And believe me, the flu is devastating within a nursing home. I can't imagine trying to deal with a covid outbreak.
1	The widespread use of vaccines has significantly reduced disease, disability, and death.
1	Well done this video truly did simply explained the MRNA now I have a better understanding and I feel comfortable with the vaccine
1	By the end of this year’s gonna be perfect to me!!! 💉💉🩹🩹❤️❤️😇😇
1	I feel freedom because I can get rid of this mask soon. It’s been quite a journey
1	The vaccine was quick and easy. Highly recommend it to everyone!
1	I’m so tired of hearing people say “they made the vaccine too fast, I want to wait til they know more”
1	I got my first vaccine shot a few hours ago. Maybe a few of my cells were destroyed by the needle, but it wasn't even enough for me to feel any pain.
0	Let's be honest; most doctors knew this vaccine was dangerous a couple of years ago. Doctors need to begin speaking out. Better late than never.
0	And the SCAM continues.
0	Unfortunately, most have already taken the death jab... It's only a matter of time now.
1	"Doy gracias infinitas a Dios porque, a pesar de tener comorbilidades, ya tengo las dos dosis y no tuve ninguna reacción. Me siento bendecida porque no he tenido COVID."
0	What she didn't realize was that the FDA was in on the crime too.
0	Vaccine mandates are worrying. What about personal rights?
1	Feeling very emotional, grateful and lucky to be one of the first people in Worcestershire to receive this vaccine.
1	As a doctor i feel so sad when hearing all these false claime people raise
0	i believe in immunity after contracting it
0	Someone who was perfectly healthy then after taking the vaccine had 3 heart attacks and other symptoms . It is perfectly reasonable to assume it might be a vaccine injury.
1	LETS GOOOOOOOO I’m fucking pumped to get back out to the clubs and stand awkwardly near the bar.
0	On mass we must push back against this, don’t be obedient if there’s another crisis. Always question. Barb
0	Stop this!!! We dont need this vaccine which is not tested enough we are not an experiment
0	I haven't died to covid. I don't know a single person who has.
0	The only thing I need to know, is were not to go to get them.
0	i’m unvaccinated against COVID and i honestly am so happy i never got it
1	I don’t argue with people about the vaccine anymore. If you aren’t vaccinated let’s keep our friendship on the phone. Don’t come to my house or anywhere near me
1	We need to still be compassionate, MOST antivaxxers have seen how corrupt our government is and they have no trust in the government. Please try and support and lovingly explain to your family that you wouldn’t mislead them. The last thing we need in this horrible pandemic is less empathy
0	I know people who already have heart problems, irregular, fast palpitation, hardness of breathing after vax and boosters.
0	Unvaxed for life
1	i just think letting enough people catch covid to reach herd immunity is a worse strategy than mass vaccination, especially considering long covid and at risk populations, but hey, i'm no expert
1	Thank you to every single Doctor, nurses, and health staff dealing every day with this nightmare called Covid-19. Thank you for the scientists working around the clock to try to find a cure for this pandemic. At this point protect yourselves and protect your loved ones. I love freedom but god also provided me with common sense and logic to understand what freedom really means.
1	You explained this well! Thank You! Passing along to my anti-vaxx brother!
1	Vaccination was proven effective and safe which is good enough for me! I don’t want to stay susceptible to a deadly virus.
0	A friend of mine had a stroke, just 2 weeks after his second covid vaccine ...! Coincidence? I doubt it!
1	If you haven’t received your safe & effective #Covid19 #vaccine booster to stop the spread, please do your part! We’re all in this together & this is the only way we get through this! Just a few weeks & we’ve got this
0	For crying out loud she's a professional doctor! respect her choice not to get the vaccine!
1	If you’re overweight, have a health condition, or over 40 years of age and STILL don’t get vaccinated... I mean, wtf are you expecting? You’re the at-risk group. Half the people I know not getting vaccinated are overweight or 50+ because it “won’t be me”. So stupid.
0	Why are the pharmaceutical companies held harmless for injuries and deaths caused by their vaccines?????
1	I actually really enjoyed this. I am pro-vaccine but I also believe that people should have choices and understand that this is a super complex issue. I had a bad reaction (allergic but not anaphylactic)
1	I think science class should be mandatory.
0	I hope everyone who pushed this jab is brought to justice soon
0	I have several friends who I've known for 20+ years, so I know their history. As soon as they took the vaccine, their bodies went haywire. I didn't take it (and never will), and I'm just fine. The other 8 people I know who have had no health symptoms - all unvaccinated. Although some of the vaccinated people I know haven't had ill effects, it's about one per week now - who ends-up getting shingles, or needs ankle braces (a common side effect from the vaccine). I work at a medical clinic, so 'm thinking - I know a little bit more about this - than your average Joanne.
1	This is painful to even look at. Antivaxxers are fucking sickening and, normally i dont have much of a problem with dumb viewpoints (such as flat earthers) but theyre affecting theyre KIDS who have NO say in this. All because they feel some need to be a special snowflake and feel superior because theyre more “aware”
1	I’m fully vaccinated and no longer wearing a mask. I’m not going to wear it for the benefit of the unvaccinated. If you haven’t been vaccinated then it’s on you if you get sick.
1	I go tomorrow to get mine
0	The jab is worse than the illness.
1	My husband is doing great, too, after his 2nd shot.
0	How can it be rare when EVERYONE that I know who took the jab suffered or is suffering side effects?
1	Received my COVID vaccine one step closer to normalcy
0	I and my family lost everything for saying NO. Our jobs, our money, our house, our family, our friends, and people still treat us like leppers. But we DON'T mind, we are all healthy, we are all alive, we all have had Covid with no serious health effects, whereas many we know now are dead, dying, or have serious life changing side effects. NEVER FORGIVE NEVER FORGET
1	Yes of course I'll get vaccinated! I’ve had Covid, and don’t ever want to go through that again. I’ve also gotten my Flu shot,
1	The vax deniers and their GOP masters are morally responsible for a lot of deaths
0	Imagine these vaccines don't work on incoming variants, and WHO has to make another vaccine and all those fully vaccinated still need another dose lmao the business keeps going
1	Imagine these vaccines don't work on incoming variants, and WHO has to make another vaccine and all those fully vaccinated still need another dose lmao the business keeps going
0	As a nurse, witnessed people who have experienced blood clots, myocarditis, serious autoimmune issues following the shots, the doctors will not admit it's the shots and leave the person stranded. It's so awful, I can't recommend them (nurse).
1	all the antivaxxers are idiots that dont know what they are talking about
1	I think outside of legitimate medical reasons, nobody should be avoiding vaccination and I do agree with the mandates.
1	I was so scared of getting the vaccine...until I realized the nurse finished and I barely felt a thing, and I joked: did u just pretend to do it? we both laugh and I felt at ease
0	I refused the vaccines. My dr was very unhappy with me, she said I'd be dead ina year. That was almost 2 years ago. Something just told me not to get the shots. I am in the USA. You have given your best advice, and I thankyou.
1	When I was a small kid the Salk and Sabin polio vaccines were released. My father made sure I got both of them immediately. Is there any reason not to take all Covid 19 vaccines as they become available, especially if they have different modes of action?
0	I am remaining unvaxxed. At all cost that is important.
1	So many diseases are preventable thanks to vaccines. Protect your family !
1	COVID-19 vaccines are an important and precious resource, but, unfortunately, the process to receive these vaccines can be confusing and difficult to navigate
1	I think people still don't understand that it's like getting a flu shot. You can still get the flu after getting a flu vaccine. Your just a whole lot less likely to die from the flu if you get the vaccine. But seeing as how over half the population reads at a 6th grade level or below I'm not sure it could be explained to them in any meaningful way. Maybe if someone made a conspiracy theory that convinced people to get vaccinated. That might work.
1	One thing that is really promising is that this particular vaccine candidate was based around the concept of using RNA to express the antigen. If this vaccine proves to be secure, effective and efficient it may mean that we could create vaccines against other infectious diseases such as Dengue much easily and cheaply. For me that was the particular appeal of this candidate.
1	My grandparents are vaccinated now
1	Joining the vaccinated club
0	It’s so rare, it keeps happening. I’m good with my natural immunity thanks.
0	Oh great another scam jab
0	There's something fishy about how vaccines are promoted. Follow the money!
0	Stay away from the poison
1	Friendly reminder that being healthy and able bodied is a temporary state of life. Each COVID infection has a chance to take that away from you. So get the vaccine!
0	I'm just over 50 unjabbed and no way on earth am I ever having this crap injected in me....
1	My own understanding is that RNA vaccines aren’t new at all , the research wasn’t new when covid came . The funding and communication between scientists all over the world expedited the mRNA for covid . As of now, literally millions of people have had the covid vaccine coming from all backgrounds and available healthcare , the data is certainly there . Of course there are reactions to any medicine by individuals , statistically however, it’s very low for the covid vaccine
0	Should have studied these more and not censored those who were sounding the alarms!
1	I want to get the vaccine but at the same time I’m scared because there is little known about long term complications and whether it is safe for people with serious illnesses/ lowered immune systems.
0	I like the immune system the Creator gave me just fine. Just say no to drugs.
0	My heart said no; my head said no. I said yes to my instinct and said no to the 'vaccine'. Happy and healthy.
1	Not believing in vaccines is not believing in science
1	Thank you so much for sharing this. I’m a high risk patient and just had my 3rd vaccine and due my booster soon! The more people vaccinated the better!  X
0	THANK GOD I DID NOT GET THE VACCINE
0	My mom had two brain aneurisms after her shots and died soon after !!!
0	I’m an old RN and agree with you 💯. I’ve made it to 50 and so far totally healthy living that way. I refused the v. I let my own immune system handle things. So far so good.
0	Don’t care, I won’t be vaccinating or masking.
0	I've never made a better decision in my life by protecting most of my family from the not vaccine.
0	Knowing what we know now, I absolutely regret getting the vaccine. I’m worried about the long term affects now too. Honestly one of the worst decisions of my life.
1	People who died after the vaccine, that might be due to some other complications but trust me guys this vaccine has saved my daughter's life.
1	My medically qualified Doctor: "Vaccines are safe, and save lives"   Randomer online: "VaCcInEs cAuSe hEaRt aTaCks"
1	I had 1st shot of Pfizer yesterday morning, no severe sad effects, just felt hungry and about 30 minutes light headache in the afternoon. I have been on diet. Yesterday I had to eat three good meals, with carb, red meat, vegetables, fruits, nuts, fish now I feel normal.
1	Getting vaccinated is a responsible and caring choice for our community's well-being.
1	Covid vaccines are safe and effective, what do trans youth have to do with Covid vaccines?
1	Vaccines worked so well in eradicating certain diseases people forgot how horrible those diseases were.
0	It's not a vaccination - it's a dose of mRNA chemicals which also carries the risk of death/permanent side effects that bothers me In Wales, 48% of deaths happened SINCE the injections commenced #SPUTNIKV has neither death or harms associated with it
1	Still dont know a single person who had a problem.
0	I’ve had ALL the side effects from the Pfizer 1 Shot last week still have No Energy ! I was Not Sick before that !
1	I’m feeling pretty good. I don’t really like shots, but it doesn’t hurt. I’ve had a really good day.
0	I've heard too many stories about adverse reactions to trust the safety of these vaccines
0	I live by my own. Hunt my own food. Dont meet people. Dont need other people. Same goes with the vaccine
1	My cousin got her vaccine early on in her pregnancy and she was completely fine and now her baby is immune to an extent, too!
1	Savage and accurate. Remember, "facts don't care about your feelings" is their motto - so I'm sure this will be received well.
1	Getting vaccinated isn't just about me—it's about community immunity. Let's all do our part! #VaccinesWork
1	I don’t think people truly appreciate how massive of a breakthrough this was. Remember all the scientists who’s said that it’ll take 10 years, minimum, to make a vaccine? Well with the technology of the time they were correct.We can legit just take a bit of a virus and in a few weeks have a ready vaccine. It took 8 hours to create the covid vaccine, 8 hours of a supercomputer brute forcing different “keys” into the “hole”.
1	The conspiracy theorist again were right. Not a conspiracy
0	Imagine instead of bankers we vaccinated our elderly first
1	I'm not anti vaccination.
0	Dr Robert Malone (One of the founding inventors on mRNA technology) says: 'This is the first time in history that the ineffectiveness of a vaccine has been blamed on those who have not taken it!'
0	A swiss study did before and after study from the shot. They found that one in 35 people had myocardial injury. I cannot believe that the medical establishment is still pushing the shot.
0	I love how they didnâ€™t take the time to mention the potential side effects, like itâ€™s great and all that they have this new method ( which has been around for the last ~20 years for the specified use for unique individuals), but new means unknown and unknown means we have lots to learn from testing and trials which we gladly skipped with this one. This video just showed me how people are easily influenced and do not care to look further, wasnâ€™t this a little to simple or even too good to be true. Maybe Iâ€™m wrong, but why not prove me wrong.  Because from what I see, no one here understands what they put in their body. My only goal here is to help keep us all healthy and curious people who make good choices on their own.
1	It's heartening to see communities come together for mass vaccination efforts.
1	I love vaccines and the things they have done for humanity.
1	You can't do that because there's no way to know how many were "saved".  It's only a guess.  What I do know is that 4 billion has been paid out so far for vaccine injury, and that's only the cases they can prove.  It's my belief that vaccines cause other side effects that aren't usually attributed to the vaccine, such as autism, allergies, autoimmune disorders, digestive problems, and many other things that don't get reported.  The problem is these side effects happen over time as a result of vaccines, whereas the studies only followed people for 1 week.  So every side effect having been realized after 1 week weren't counted in the totals.  It's shady science.
1	I worked in a hospital during pandemic, wore proper masks gowns, vaccines, never got covid.
1	YES. I do not understand peoples fear of vaccines. We have literal proof that they work. Measles, small pox, chicken pox,polio, hepatitis ,a million others. THEY WORK. They’re available for us. Why wouldn’t you get it? IT MAKES ZERO SENSE. You think that if the people in the 1800s were told there’s a vaccine that will prevent you from getting it or dying from it they would pass up on it? These diseases have literally been eradicated because of vaccines. I just can’t.
0	Geez...and I thought trumpy was insane! This guy is truly  disturbed!
0	The same people bashing on “anti-vaxxers” are the same people saying “my body my choice.” Pathetic.
1	Just got my COVID booster shot! Grateful for science and protecting my loved ones.
0	The vaccine rollout is more about control than health.
0	My mother died of a stroke after her second vaccine. She’d never had a stroke before.
0	Nobody regrets not getting the jab.
1	As someone who had covid last year and just got vaccinated, trust me, the vaccine side effects are WAY less painful than actually having it.
1	This is a good reminder that just because someone is vaccinated does NOT mean you can not get Covid. Even in the best scenario it is 95% effective. With these new variants out there the percentage gets lower and lower.
0	The CovidVaccine was not safe for my dad. Paralysed from the neck down.Hospitalised for 2 months.Neuro rehabilitation for 2 months.Left with permanent nerve damage in both legs and feet with no feeling in them & severe pain. 3 years this month!
0	I had so many family members try to tell me that I was reason that COVID persisted because of not getting vaccinated. They are not saying that now.
0	If you're not vaccinated at the moment and you're eligible, and you've got no health reasons for not being unvaccinated, you're not just irresponsible. You're an idiot.
1	All six of my immunizing events have been vaccinations, and I have never had Covid.
0	I am sorry that you took the shot, just do a little research, and you'll see.
0	I got the Pfizer vaccine two days ago and died shortly thereafter...
0	If you are vaccinated you are more likely to get sick.its been like this ever since the vaccinations started my wife and i are around many people who are sick every covid wave.
1	Vaccines are the key to returning to a pre-pandemic life.
0	>You know what kills you  Most of those Diseases don't kill you often at all. 90% of the time they don't even cause a serious problem, just short term fever, rashes, coughing, mucus, mild diarrhea..  Only rashes and diarrhrea are the disease, the rest is just immune response.  You get immune response either way, yes you get less from a vaccine, but thats because the vaccine is in small amounts, and whoopsy, small amounts of disease = small amounts of immunity.  Full immunity required getting the real disease, not the laboratory disease.  The safer the vaccine, the more useless.  Vaccines have to be a certain level of unsafe in order to actually work!  They have to provoke your immune system to even cause a response.  So, they literally have to do damage, in order to have a response.  Maybe less than wild disease, but still enough to cause the diseases symptoms, especially since the disease is injected into your arm, not orally taken.  So, you prevent a disease, by giving yourself a weaker laboratory version, into a weaker part of your body, and this almost, if not completely cancels out the efficacy.  You end up just doing yourself harm anyway.  There's no such thing as a safe vaccine, because a safe vaccine, is a vaccine that doesn't do squat.
1	Furthermore, vaccinated people have a lower viral load, so even if they are infected, they are still less likely to spread it.
0	Just the fact that you can't sue drug companys makes me not want to take the jab.
0	So safe that they faked injection on tv.
0	You're hilarious if you think I'm taking even 1 single vaccine
1	If this was vaccine was not invented there wouldn't have been today
0	You need a 4th shot because the first 3 turned your immune system into a big pharma subscription service.
0	"I'm not trying to persuade you or anything" INTENSE DEATH STARE
1	Humanity is starting to take some big steps against the virus now.
0	My uncle had a heart attack 1 week after getting the Pfizer vaccine, lucky he survived, but is in constant pain. My aunt also started having uncontrollable shaking and tremors.
0	is a person considered anti vaxxer because they are concerned what goes in their body? No. They are not.
0	The way this whole thing was handled has turned me complete anti vaxx. I hope everyone effected gets justice.
0	The people who got narcolepsy were the least at risk from the influenza. Young tween and teenage girls. That Swede actually learned his lesson.
0	I'm glad I never got that poison
1	You make the most sense out of anyone on this post. Vaccines don’t cause deaths, allergic reactions to the things in the vaccines do, and there are barely any of those. The chance of even having a reaction is 1 in 10,000,000. Autism isn’t caused by vaccines either, it’s a mental disorder that people get at birth. These people are complete idiots, and the fact that even you, a 13 year old, is able to debunk these shitty theories just shows how idiotic anti-vaxxers are. Most of the “facts” they get, are from a shady website made by another biased anti-vaxxer, who got their “facts” from the same kind of thing.
1	I just got my first dose of the vaccine a few days ago! My arm was sore obviously, but I'm perfectly fine right now
0	Thank you. I did not have the jabs because there was no true level of informed consent. Many of my friends who took no heed to my concerns, did suffer adverse events and those are happening to this day
0	I did not get the clot shot. The surgeon general of my state came out saying the shot is linked to blood clots and heart failure. I’m so glad I listened to my instincts and not the doctors trying to force me to take it.
1	As a parent, I'm thrilled to see continuous progress in vaccine development. It gives me hope for a brighter and healthier future for our children.
0	The Vaccine & witchcraft is a tool. To do what, you guess right, kxll!
0	I am so relieved I did not take it and neither did my husband or kids. I can sleep at night knowing that poison is not in us. It disgusts me that people who hang onto ignorance because they are scared it's in them can't look around at all the people speaking out. All the young people who collapsed and died is heart breaking
0	Not gonna take a vaccine that is 95% effective and rushed through approval when I have a 99%+ chance of survival. I’ll let all you sheep take it and wait a decade to see it I should follow suit
1	Vaccine scheduled
0	Not a single one of us regrets not getting the jab…NOT ONE
0	Ngl no sure bout vaccine. Process, possible aches, no garantee.
0	Gives you a permanent and irreversible heart condition like a boss
0	"I believe in natural selection; those who are vulnerable should take precautions, but I won't get the vaccine."
1	I called my Locale CVS in NJ as I'm refilling a prescription tomorrow & asked if I could get the new COVID booster as well.
0	I did not want the shots but was forced as a nurse. Got the first two Pfizer and got horribly ill. Refused the boosters and have been harassed over it. It’s been two years and I’m living with side effects from it. Extreme fatigue, vision issues, and heart palpitations. I applaud this girl standing up for what is right. The way people are treated who said no to the vaccines is disgusting, their concerns are real and should be listened to.
1	The COVID shot is not a vaccine, it is just like the flu shot that we have to take every year.
1	27th Lill Woozy but never better safe an effective
1	You're downplaying the risks of vaccines. As opposed to downplaying the risks of measles, polio, smallpox, etc?
0	If you like being sick, and are tired of being alive, keep getting boosted.
1	I just got my second dose today, and am very happy and lucky that my entire immediate family was able to get the vaccine <3
1	I love the phrase "fall arsenal," like it's a seasonal fashion collection of vaccinations
0	The Moderna Covid shot almost killed me !
0	Hell no! Poison clot shot!
1	"Thank you, today they are vaccinating my grandmother."
0	Not heard anyone say they regretted NOT having the jab.
0	I couldn’t be more certain I made the right decision not to get vaccinated.
0	I am 68 years old,  not vaccinated, never had Covid and perfectly healthy.  In my county we were put under house arrest, discriminated and pressured worse than in any authoritarian regime but we stood our ground and I a  so happy we did
1	All vaccines currently given to humans have shown their side effects within 6 weeks after administration, except for one or two instances with patients who received live vaccines, which this is not - the FDA’s vaccine advisory panel actually brought this up during their meeting on the 10th.  This vaccine had no serious side effects except for allergic reactions, which have been rare (mostly in people who have other severe allergies), and they’ll be following Bell’s palsy more closely to see if there’s any relationship.  If there are any long term effects, they will be quite rare, much rarer (and milder) than the potential long term effects of covid that we’re starting to see like lung scarring, breathing issues, etc
1	It sounds great.
1	Do you know that for a fact? Do they test the MMR vaccination in Combination, like it's administered in a Dr's office ?  Vaccinations are Multi-Billion Dollar medical product. Big pharma isnt making them out of the good of their heart, they do so for profit.
1	I'm proud to say that I got the vaccine. It's our responsibility to do what we can to protect ourselves and others from this virus.
1	I'm Canadian, and I want the vaccine.
1	Getting my first dose of the PfizerBioNTech covid vaccine next weekend and seeing this unboxing just made it so real
0	I was never an antivaxxer but I am now. If God decides to bless us with more children I won’t be getting them vaxxed. If they decide they want to when they are older then fine. I do not trust the pharmaceutical companies one bit.
0	Wake up
0	Omg you guys are obsessed with vaccines! I will never trust another vaccine. I’ve gotten so many vaccines in my life but covid really she’s a light on how you guys operate. Bought and paid for by big pharma
0	Sounds like we are the test subjects.
1	Mother, worried about children, now vaccinated, breathe easier.
0	I didn't have memory problems until the afternoon I took the vaxx.
0	This happened to me! I got my first dose and a few weeks later I was hospitalized and my platelets were VERY low and my red blood cells were EXTREMELY high. The doctor said I wasn’t supposed to be alive. I had the Pfizer vaccine. I regret I ever got that shot.
1	Vaccination against COVID-19 consistently reduced the risk of long COVID symptoms, which highlights the importance of vaccination to prevent persistent COVID-19 symptoms, particularly in adults.
1	I was prescribed this yesterday and can say that I have done 3 doses so far and I already feel much better!!!! It does make everything taste awful but compared to how I was feeling, ill take it!
1	I'm 77 and had no side effects from either dose of the Pfizer vaccine other than a slightly sore arm. I'm pretty healthy though for my age. It sure feels good though to know that now I should be protected. The past year was a little scary!
0	I fucking hate the vaccine
1	I feel that a possible way to get through to these people is for insurance companies to say if you are eligible to be vaccinated but choose not to then you will be billed 100% of the hospital costs.  Why not?  Insurance companies run everything that has to do with our healthcare anyway.
0	Thanks for poisoning us
1	Most people go thru midlife crisis at age 40 or 60. If you weren't vaccinated, its age 2.
0	Do they tell you about the tracking chip?
1	My dad is high risk and got the first of two covid shots, he's getting his second one today and he has felt completely fine.
1	Had my Jab today feeling great, thanks Astra Zeneca.
0	Both of the friends of mine who were so pissed that I didn’t get vaccinated are still experiencing side effects from the vaccine and decided not to get the third booster.
0	after jab this dude about to turn into some dinosaur or something
0	There is currently no reason for healthy people under 40 years to get the Covid-19 vaccine
1	This is the power of science. Step aside celebrities- these people are who should be famous.
0	I regret getting it man.. I regret it
1	I’m 30 and work at a school, and I am so grateful that I was able to get my second shot last week. My arm hurt for a day, but other than that I was fine. Now I can go to work without feeling like I’m taking my life in my hands. I’ll be able to hug my gran
1	I got the covied shots and I'm Just fine
0	"Congratulations to all who didn't fall for such wickedness. Blessings."
0	I don't trust the vaccine or the government.
1	Well if you don't want to give COVID to people who are at risk and not be a selfish douche bag, yes there's a reason for you to get it
1	COVID-19 vaccines have saved millions of lives
0	Lie everyone I know including my sister was very sick after the vaccine.
0	Yeah excess death running at 20% in UK, covid shots might be the reason
1	More power to every scientists who strive to create vaccines
0	Go ahead take it its not safe but go ahead i cant tell you how many people i know died that had shot or are having heart and brain issues ill never ever take it
1	I am glad that there are so many antivaxxers, it means more vaccines for me
1	I got vaccinated because I like feeling free.
1	My sister had a reaction to a vaccine and can't get certain ones. She's still pro-vaccine.
0	I DIDNT GET THE VACCINE because I studied the risks and made the best decision.
0	Who else is pretty sure they had COVID back in December of 2019? I know I did bc I NEVER get sick and bed ridden… felt like a really bad FLU and it was for 3 days…. Idk man I been to Disney 5 times the last 3 months & I’m fine*I got covid 2 weeks after this comment
0	I've never gotten the COVID vax or the flu vax I have all the other ones required to go to public schools tho
1	As a nurse, I witnessed my coworkers have significant adverse effects and then be met with stone silence by the medical establishment. That was enough to make me not want to take it.
1	I know some people are concerned about the side effects of COVID-19 vaccines. But the most common side effects are mild and go away on their own within a few days.
1	"I got the second dose three days ago. I only felt sleepy and had a slight body ache, no fever, just for one night. Up to now, I feel well, without any issues. Grateful that I am vaccinated, and my family too."
0	Ignoring #COVID19vaccine deaths isn’t just fraudulent intentions. It’s felony murder!
0	Crap gave my Dad cancer…
1	Half a million doses, that's actually not bad, and only around two months before we got our first vaccines.
0	Why would anyone need a microchip injected into them - we all have mobile phones! Some people just defy logic !!!
1	lets go! finally vaccines are getting widespread
0	vaccines are a profit-driven agenda, not about saving lives.
1	#Vaxed-Boosted-Flu-Pneumonia- Shingles- I believe in science- your rights end when they endanger society
0	What is in the vaccine?
0	Imagine a product so awful that you have to lobby for tyrannical laws just so ppl will buy it.
1	I personally know 6 people that died of COVID and I don’t know anyone that has died of being vaccinated.
1	I chose to get vaccinated not for me, but for the ones I love. I want to live my life and to do it without guilt.
0	I won't be getting that shot. No way in hell.
1	First the cdc said vaccination would end covid, then they came back and said vaccination won’t end transmission. The cdc said to get a pcr test instead of a rapid test, but now they’re saying pcr tests can give positive results for 3 months. Keep on trusting them.
0	One of the best life decisions I made for me and my family was NOT to take any shots of any covid vaccines regardless the great panic and great social pressure against the unvaccinated
1	By getting vaccinated, you're not just protecting yourself, but also those around you.
1	Vaccines are safe.
0	I know someone who’s friend got the shot. The guy was healthy for someone in his fifties, didn’t have any health issues, yet died ten days after getting the shot.
1	I had both my vaccines(I'm from the the UK and had AstraZeneca) My first jab was flu symptoms, hot to cold and then shivers for a few hours then I was completely fine. My second was even better since I had a headache... that's it.
1	95% protection for how long? Is this one and done like childhood vaccines ? Booster shot?
1	The vaccine teaches your body how to do a thing.
0	What do we need to know about the vax? Do the opposite of whatever you want us to do
1	If not for yourself, get vaccinated for people that cannot. They count on all of us
0	My employer threatened over and over and over again for me to get back and I declined every single time and I told them to just let me go or fire me because I Will Never Surrender my health my fate and my divinity to anybody other than God,  Jesus Christ that is.
1	The absolute best way to avoid contracting Covid is to BOTH get vaccinated AND wear a mask every time you are indoors with other people.
1	Thank you all for everything you all are doing to help gain an understanding of the COVID-19 virus to help treat patients who fall ill from the virus and also to develop a vaccine for the virus. Greatest respect and appreciation.
1	’m a teacher. I can’t wait until I can get a vaccine and hopefully get my students all back in person again
0	We know the 'Jab' isn't safe. I can't believe they think they can get away with lying to us like this. He's disregarding all the 'Jab' injured people. Disgraceful.
1	people with functioning immune systems don't need drugs.    exercise, eat whole foods, get sunlight > pharmaceuticals
1	Yes, but the chances of getting severely sick are way smaller. (A lot of ER are full of unvaccinated covid patients)
0	I'd rather focus on improving overall public health rather than relying on vaccines.
0	So, if I build a model that proves otherwise would you accept that? All models are based on assumptions. There are plenty of countries which has extremely low vaccination rates and they seem to have done fine
0	Nothing says "trust the science" quite like "you can't sue us if something goes wrong" and "we need 75 years to release the data to the public".
0	Still had a 103.5 fever with Covid even though I have the vaccine
1	Vaccination is a responsible choice for anyone who cares about the health of their community.
0	Just stop ….
1	One day of discomfort outweighed by the benefits of being protected from COVID-19.
1	Had my covid booster at 9:05am. Retired to the boudoir at 1:15pm when the littlest fell asleep on my lap. Woken up sweaty, barely thinking straight and very very nauseous. If this is a fraction of what covid feels like, hallelujah for vaccination.
0	The only guaranteed immunity is from prosecution (for big pharmaceutical companies).
0	Just the fact that you can't sue drug companys makes me not want to take the jab.
0	Cancer explosion hitting the vaccinated. Alex Jones interviews Dr Judy Mikovits on the Covid-19 vaccine causing cancer.
1	Vaccines keep us well-armed against illness
1	I believe with everything in me that these vaccines have kept me safe (we still mask up on outings and social distance) and I'd like to think that we are helping keep others safe as well.
0	I had 2 jabs and was very sick with a reaction within 2 hours . I will never put my life at risk by putting this junk into my body again. I should of listened to my own instincts and not had it
1	I'm much more worried about the side effects of when I got COVID than from my vaccine. I had sides effects from COVID for months, I had no side effects from the vaccine
0	"Why do the protected need to be protected from the unprotected by forcing the unprotected to use the protection that didn't protect the protected in the first place?" - Unvaccinated 2021
0	The jab is apparently turning people into horses.
1	I just got vaccinated with moderna (mRNA) yesterday. So far so good I have no side effects
0	In light of recent events this is not going to age well. Sometimes trusting your gut is better than falling for the authority fallacy.
1	I'm very glad I got it and I will happily get any boosters that come my way
0	Why exactly should I get a vaccine against a virus I didn't catch in almost 2 years as a healthy 27 year old?....and follow up question. why do you think it's a good thing the government can get me fired for that decision?
1	people allowed me in office only after i had my vaccination and I think that is one of the great step to stop the spread
0	I am glad I watched this because it helped me realise that the shots are certainly unsafe.
0	"This was a deception. I also didn't get vaccinated, never changed my activities, travel by bus with crowds, and here I am, thank God."
1	I regret not getting it before I got sick. That was a miserable two weeks but I recovered. Housemate that gave it to me had long covid and secondary bronchitis infection, long covid, lasting 6 weeks.
0	have been effected. It got so bad I was hospitalized for 3 days. Pain and weakness is extreme
0	Risks you say? Well when businesses were mandating it for people to work without them knowing the risks. I'm just so grateful that I never took the vaccine even though I lost my 20 year career at a hospital. I'm still alive. Had covid 14 months ago . No p
0	I'm strictly pro-choice on the matter. Any government, employer, or airline that makes any attempt of "mandatory" vaccination is overstepping. The survival rate for covid in my age group is between 99.4 to 99.8 percent with one of the first recipients of the vaccine reporting nausea, confusion, fatigue, and vomiting for a few days. Considering these two things, risk of death from not being vaccinated, to the possibility of feeling ill side effects, I'm going to pass.
1	Few hours and USA will cross 100,000 patients. Hope sooner the vaccine 💉 antidote is available better for humanity. GOD SAVE GREAT COUNTRY!!! Your Great Leader is giving his best shots to protect you, help him. In God We Trust! #COVID19 #COVID2019
1	What a relief. Thank you very much everyone who put their strength and effort to save humans.
1	I would happily take it immediately not because I’m scared of getting Covid but because this is how we restart the economy and save jobs!!!
1	I consider that this is the thing all of us should do in order to surpass this stage of our lives. I believe in science and in medicine, in research and in doctors. I am very grateful to them for all the time they dedicated to the development of this vaccine. I am lucky to have had access to the vaccination services! I encourage everyone who can to get vaccinated! You can also contribute to the return to normality!
0	I'm worried about the vaccine's long-term effects. The speed of its development, though a scientific marvel, leaves me questioning if all potential side effects were adequately studied.
0	NO WAY, I WANT TO LIVE LONG WITHOUT VACCINE!!!
1	This is outstanding data. Granted, it doesn't meet the criteria for highly effective, however, there has never been a vaccine against a coronavirus. The flu vaccine is only about 50-60% effective. Pfizer and Biontech just blew that away. This is without question very good news.  Antivax will be a bigger problem than covid now. I'll be first in line to take the vax.
1	Covid Vaccines Are Officially Deadliest Drug In History and Nobody Is Allowed to Talk About It The Pfizer Covid-19 mRNA vaccine is now officially the most deadly drug in the history of Western medicine, killing and injuring hundreds of millions of people, with new cases emerging every single day as the fallout from the rollout continues to blow out exponentially. But don’t take my word from it. The data that proves Covid vaccines are the deadliest drug in the long history of Western medicine is taken from Pfizer’s own documents. That’s right – Pfizer have released documents admitting the unprecedented carnage caused by their product. While previous deadly drugs caused a scandal in their day – think of Thalidomide, for instance – nobody is allowed to talk about the fact experimental mRNA vaccines have killed an extraordinary number of people. The cover up is extraordinary and it continues to this day with Bill Gates recently boasting of a new range of mRNA vaccines for every conceivable ailment. This evil plot against humanity has been in the works for years, and those who know the truth have a duty to expose it to as many people as possible.
1	Why can't the anti-vaxxers just stop!? Go take your vaccine!!!
1	People had almost two years to pull their head out of their collective ass. At this point it's lodged so far up there's nothing to do beyond that.
1	You make a great point! I'm so glad that Dr. Fauci is fully vaccinated and still with us!
1	The newest booster has had the most mild effects of any of them for me. I got my DESTROYED by my first few doses and even then other boosters have knocked me down. This year's booster was pretty mild. Sore arm, little fatigue, little body aches. But I was able to get through a normal day as opposed to being stuck in bed like all my previous covid vaccines.  Definitely go get the booster! Get flu and rsv, too. The ERs are blowing up with covid and rsv right now!
0	How did we deem these particular vaccines safe? (Other than the 'emergency act') Folks have been trying to make a safe (by FDA standards) coronavirus vax since 2002, ...unsuccessfully.
1	mate, this is a message from the future. The vaccines actually work! Tons of independent studies are showing they work. Israel, the most vaccinated country on earth with the mRNA vaccine is a perfect case study in the fact that they work
1	I do not treat people with Covid 19, but as a healthcare worker who spends my day treating elderly patients, I will most certainly take this vaccine. It looks as though it might be available to me within a few weeks. Great video, and thanks for sharing this info to others who might be a bit hesitant to be vaccinated.
1	I’ve had the initial two shots and two boosters. I’m anticipating the next booster will include additional coverage for the Omicron variant.
1	When will people stop likening vaccine policies to Jim Crow laws.
0	My description of vaccines. PUBLIC ENEMY NUMBER ONE !
0	I've done my research, and there are concerns about the vaccine's long-term effects. #InformedDecision
1	You can be vaccinated and ready to fight it, then when exposed build more natural immunity at lower risk. That's how it should work.
0	Doesn’t shit like this need to be tested for 4-5 years for it to be considered safe??
1	I’m happy I have a pro vax mom
1	It's amazing to see how quickly scientists developed safe and effective vaccines.
0	We are a nation where the average level of education is high school, where the average grade was a C, yet they all think they're freaking Nobel Laureates.
1	The vaccine is a testament to what we can achieve together.
0	People are suffering from post covid19 because of the vaccine they have been injected with. It looks like they are getting deaperate for you to continue with their boosters, so as to achieve their depopulation plan. Those that are unvaxxed, stay that way and live.
0	Most people now regret having the 'vaccine' I was talking in the pub last night. The amount of people who now wish they had not got it is now huge.
1	Despite Omicron's rapid spread, current COVID-19 strategies like vaccination, masking, social distancing can slow its transmission.  Wearing a HHL mask provides both #Antimicrobial Protection; trapping and killing pathogens on the treated surface. #puretex #hhltechnology
1	I took the the first and second Pfizer vaccines
0	I am so glad I only got the first vaccination. I didn't have any side effects but I listened to my gut instincts and didn't get the booster or any subsequent vaccines. I feel deeply for everyone who has lost someone due to covid 19.
0	Vaccines are like small dozes of poison.
0	OMG! Stomach bug! Line up for your clot / myocradious / cancer booster!
1	I feel safer knowing that I'm less likely to experience severe symptoms if I get infected.
0	Someone who was perfectly healthy then had 3 heart attacks and other symptoms . It is perfectly reasonable to assume it might be a vaccine injury.
0	Africa had very few vaccinations and very few deaths on both fronts relatively. Surprised that data didn’t seem to make of an impact on analysis.
1	"I get vaccinated on Saturday woooooo!"
1	When we get vaccinated, we're not just protecting ourselves but also the most vulnerable in our society.
1	Delta almost killed me. If I hadn't been vaccinated I know I wouldn't be here.
1	I had my first shot a few days ago. The only side effect I had was a mild headache and a slight tender arm. Only lasted a few hours.
0	Oh my gosh, I never got the jab and I’m perfectly fine!
0	Didn't the CDC get info from the pharma companies that the boosters were bs?
0	at #SPSP2024, i’ll be presenting a poster that explains how social media posts like these led people to experience more severe COVID-19 vaccine side effects. 🤒excited to attend for the first time!
0	I was pro vaccine back when this whole pandemic felt brand new because at the time i thought that a vaccine would "save us" but  i would say that I'm more enlightened now than ever before. I got vaccinated and regretted it as soon as i took it because i wasn't the same ever since.   Like most people i got brain fog, vision issues, head pressures and hallucinations with it and before i got the vaccine i was perfectly healthy. The vaccine also gave me my first ever panic attack too. I am not even kidding. The week i got the vaccine a lot of bad things happened to me and i wasnt the same human ever again. Still dealing with the side effects even to this VERY day.
1	Thrilled to receive my first dose of the Covid vaccine today.
0	My concern regarding the vaccine has little to do with the vaccine itself. I think the vaccine is largely safe and effective. However, I think governments are using fear of COVID as a justification to ignore human rights.Your fear should not give you the right to effectively ban someone from getting an education, working, or shopping. You should not be allowed to ban someone from participating in society. Especially when vaccinated people can still contract and spread the disease you are afraid of.And for those saying that these aren't "real mandates" because you still have the option to get tested weekly, that isn't a real option. First, those tests in my area cost ~$100 each. Most workplaces and schools are requiring testing between 2-5 times a week. That's $200-500 a week. Second, the option for testing appears to be preliminary. My workplace and school are removing the option for testing instead of vaccination starting in January. Third, we know that vaccinated people can catch and transmit the illness. It may even be harder for a vaccinated person to tell that they are ill, which would mean they are less likely to stay home when they are actively shedding the virus. Why aren't we forcing these tests on vaccinated people as well knowing this? It's simple, the tests are just a way to force non-vaccinated people to give in without using a hard mandate, though it appears a hard mandate is coming regardless.I'm a healthcare provider. One of the most important ethical values I believe in is the right to bodily autonomy; the right to refuse treatment. I know the history of forced medical procedures and what that meant. I will not allow fear to break my belief in an individual's right to choose.I would rather die with the consequences of freedom than live with the tyranny of fear.
0	Vaccinated. Totally regret it. Even my baby who was breastfeeding suffered health issues related to it. The doctor said breastfeeding is completely safe after getting it, but Pfizer admitted that some substances cross into breastmilk and that babies have actually died as a result. Even the WHO admitted to babies dieing in a report. I also suffered side effects like heart pressure.
1	My grandparents are vaccinated now
1	I REALLY appreciate that Dr. Yasmin made the distinction between Anti-Vaxers and Vaccine-Hesitant. Ostracizing and mocking people hesitant to take a vaccine that was developed in an insanely short period of time is counterproductive. I think it is reasonable for people to want more evidence than they might usually require for such a vaccine.
0	I believe in personal responsibility, not forced vaccination. #FreedomOfChoice
0	I vaccinated nd got covid nd never gona take another one
0	No thanks vaccine I’ll stick to vitamins and orange juice
1	Years of medical research< an hour of online searching of anti vaccination articles
1	Please get the vaccine. My ICU is full of very sick, unvaccinated young people. Please get the vaccine.
0	Both my mother and step mother died shortly after 2nd booster a month apart .
0	How are we ever supposed to trust again!!!
0	Shoutout to the smart ones who didn’t take any Covid shots
1	Vaccines are one of, if not THE, single best medical development in history. People in the US are so spoiled by not having to deal with the diseases that they prevent to the point that they have no concept of what it was like before vaccines.
1	Got my first one! get my second one march 5th! I'm so glad you're doing well!
0	Risk a heart attack to maybe not catch a cold. Seems legit
1	Guys, seriously, getting vaxxed isn't just about you, it's about keeping your fam and community safe too!
1	Got both shots.....no issues here. Little tired after 2nd one. I get that some not so lucky, but a lot of fear mongering on this board. The majority of people have no issues. To quote Mr.Spock " The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few, or the one." Do your part.
1	Fully vaccinated and happy as hell! 24 hour flu like symptoms and now my only side effect is I can't stop smiling!
0	Parents, don’t do it!!!
0	How many poison jabberwockies did you submit to ?
1	I got my 1st shot.... Ppl are not coming... It was so quiet here in south africa
0	One parent recently had quad bypass after heart attack, survived. Heathy person but had two phizer shots, other parent has a small mass getting checked out.. They had one shot Astra.. My family members buddy had two phizer and dropped dead in front of other friends no warning, this was 3 months before my parents heart attack. My book keepers mother had moderna 1shot and she had something that fked up how she walked, just getting better after 2years. These vacs seem more like a death clock that trigger randomly
1	That's the main issue.  Everyone I know that is pro-vax and trusts the medical industry is extremely sick!  They're all on medications for something yet still believe the medical industry is saving their lives.  They have no clue.
0	I was forced to get my vaccines by my mum because I was under 18. I never wanted ir, because I knew it was a terrible idea, and I'm blessed to of had zero effects, but seeing what's happened to others, I am terrified now. I wish I was like you all who never touched it.
0	The scariest thing about the jab is that it stays in your body for as long as your alive, triggering all types of things that would have stayed dormant, neatly packaged away - protected by our natural immunity. Scariest part is that the person will never know for sure when it will trigger
0	Natural immunity is the best vaccine.
1	My grandma died a couple weeks ago because her hospital was too strained by covid overload and staff shortages. She had a UTI. she couldn't get the right care in a decent time frame.  I want to physically fight the next antivaxxer I see…
0	Feel like there's pressure to get the vaccine. Unsure
1	Booster + flu shot
1	Covid stepdown nurse here will be the first to take it when it gets to Duke healthcare workers
0	So, where's the PROOF her getting a vaccination would have helped her?
1	We have a new weapon against the virus: the vaccine. Hold together, again.
0	"I refused to get the last one, but I was never the same again."
0	I remember my whole house turning against me and my wife for not receiving the vaccine shot. I do not regret it.
0	Thousands have died of this since the jab was forced upon us. Facts are facts no matter how inconvenient to the medical profession and politicians
1	To all those people who refuses the shot, give it to me, i'll happily take more of them
1	In the west vaccines are so plentiful anyone should be getting them.
0	1 year since the vaccine and I am still unvaccinated. And alive. And with natural antibodies from when I got Covid April 2020.... what happened?
1	I got the first dose of Moderna and all I had was a sore arm for a day and a half, and I was a little tired. Getting my second dose very soon and expecting that I’ll probably have some side effects, but I’d rather have some side effects than get covid! Thank you for posting links from credible sources to research the vaccine 👏🏼👏🏼
0	Sadly I took 2 doses..I regret , I don't feel anything but who knows. I will keep praying to Lord keep me safe and intact from any negative impact
0	I had my first jab yesterday but I've been nauseous and weak ever since plus got a running stomach. As someone that hasn't fallen sick on a decade this sucks.
0	Gee I don’t know maybe constantly making ad hominem attacks and associating all unvaccinated people with a certain political group pushes people further into their beliefs? Public health has failed us deeply here and they only seem to be doubling down. Probably too late regardless. What little trust they had with some groups is completely gone now.
0	People should go to jail for the rest of their lives for this. I’ve never seen a clearer instance of corruption, greed, and flat out evil than this
1	I love how everyone is so fixated on the long term effects of the vaccine, when they don't even consider the long term effects of being infected with covid.
0	Years ago, one of my pre-med professors told my entire class to never take a drug within it's first 5 yrs of development unless your life depends on it because researchers never really know the extent of what a drug can do until it's administered to a massive population of people. It takes years for that data to trickle in... I never forgot that.
1	I got vaccinated to be part of the solution. Let's all contribute to community immunity and put an end to the pandemic.
0	Heroic.  You are a good man.  Much more reserved than I could be in your circumstances.  My family (spouse, children and g-children) are all unvaccinated.  They will be coming at us again soon. They admit it. God help us. I am looking up for my redemption.
1	I got my first round yesterday. i feel like i was given a charlie horse where i got the shot, but otherwise i feel good.
0	You left out the part where the VAXXINE gives you blood clots and injures your heart
0	If there is a vaccine, The White House, their friends and family, etc. will be the ones with access.  Like the  PPE situation a while ago;   Trump's son in law said that the Government supply of PPE's are for the White House and staff  (and him, family, friends etc.), not the public.   Many doctors and nurses and Americans died because they could not get PPE's.
0	Also: a negative test isn’t enough, no. It’s a way to pressure people who are unvaccinated, and are getting themselves and other infected and clotting hospitals. And it’s also no guarantee you are actually negative. Or will not get sick.
0	My grandparents lived to ripe old ages without ever getting vaccinated, so why should I start now?
0	I'll take my chances without the vaccine. No need to play guinea pig.
1	The Anti-Vaxxer crowd have been inoculated against sanity.
0	I AM UNVACCINATED AND ITS GONNA STAY THAT WAY
0	So sorry we cannot engage in helpful and necessary collaboration . This is unacceptable yet it continues . Thank you for bring a “ voice in the wilderness .”
1	This is a hard vaccine to rate, because I don't know how effective it is yet but I am hoping it gets me through omicron. NOTE - I am now 2 and half weeks passed the shot. I had the J&J for the vaccine, and Pfizer was my booster. People usually some to the
1	Hard to belive there are people out there who havent been vaccinated. They put other patients, staff, nurses and doctors at risk!
1	The facts are vaccinated people are far less likely to die and that is the goal.
0	I am also a nurse.  I had the first vaccination and boosters because we were forced to if we wanted to keep our jobs. I had a reaction to the 2nd booster, wound up in the hospital with difficulty breathing, was not covid. I will not get another vaccination forced on me and would rather let my immune system fight this now.
0	Agree with inability in reporting adverse effects. Very bad symptoms I after 2nd dose Moderna. Reporting was basically blocked.
1	Older adult's appreciation for vaccine's role in mitigating COVID-19 risks.
0	Our tax dollars to pay for a corporate shill for tax-dollar-funded poisons produced by criminal corporations with legal immunity. What a scam.
0	I’m afraid of the vaccine man, it came out way too quick and we don’t know long term effects
0	I resisted the clot shot and I'll never regret it, I had COVID only once in 2020 and it was very mild for me, haven't had it since.
0	There’s no job or no circumstance that would force me to get that jab!!!!!
0	The fact that these injections haven't been stopped and serious follow-up hasn't been done is evil
0	I got vaccinated because I want to be part of the solution in ending the pandemic.
1	Getting vaccinated was an easy decision for me, knowing it could save lives.
0	Vaccine injuries are more common than they want us to believe.
1	It should be absolutely illegal to willfully withhold vaccinations from your child. For every child that died of preventable infectious disease, the parents should be put on charges of negligent homicide. Not to mention endangering the public at large.
1	so exciting to get the vaccine congrats!!
0	I've never been vaccinated, and I've never gotten COVID. I have a Doctor who was vaccinated several times, and she got COVID twice... I also have a friend who never had a health problem in his life, and less than 2 weeks after getting the vaccine he was hospitalized with swollen lymph nodes around his heart (which constricted his breathing). He now has Hypoglycemia, Graves Disease, and anemia. I'm not sure if it was the vaccine, but it all happened immediately after.
0	Retractable needle. It wasn't a real shot. They want you to think its safe because the "fake president" got it. Its NOT safe or effective! They already came out and said you have to sign a waiver so you can't sue them if something happens to you. Don't be stupid people this was totally fake! They are trying to push another false narrative!
1	As a non-murican. I'm laughing my ass off. I never knew people were this dumb XD
1	cant wait to get it!
1	Supporting vaccination is supporting healthcare workers and vulnerable populations.
1	Vaccines CAN prevent infections, but that is not what they are intended to do for the person being vaccinated. If a vaccinated person is infected, they may be significantly less contagious, this preventing them from infecting others.↳
0	The reason they suspect the vaccine is because it is KNOWN to cause HEART PROBLEMS.
0	Looks like those that didn’t get the jab were right.
0	You could have possibly had the placebo shots, It was an experiment after all
0	to mandate vacination is to me a bridge to far. esspecialy because this covid vax is not going to put a stop to the spread of sars-cov-2. it just helps to limit the severity of sickness
0	this was rushed...concern for long term side effects?
0	People are sick because they took the mRNA covid vaccines, it has destroyed their immune system.
1	Vaccines aren't just about protecting ourselves but also about protecting those who can't get vaccinated.
1	Most anti vaxxers ain't gonna listen
0	Me and my husband are not getting that jab we been fine with out it since the pandemic
1	I used to be like those “if your healthy you won’t get covid..” i was the most healthy physically in our family yet I got the worst symptoms… until now im still recovering 3 weeks after testing negative…I got vaccinated yesterday with Pfizer .. thank you US embassy and the american people!
1	Now my idea of the vaccine has changed, thank you! I agree with the comments, video well-done :)
0	That is absolutely evil to give a child a Covid shot when we know we are having adverse reactions
1	Ohh yay , new COVID vaccines!!!!
0	So sad. 17 million dead from the vax.
1	I CANT WAIT I CANT WAIT I CANT WAIT GIMMME DAT SHOOOOOOTTTTZ
1	good video! very concise and easy to understand. the graphics shown also helps in better understanding about the vaccine's roles. thanks! i'll show this video with my friends and family and those antivax
1	Hey Theo. CTE and addiction aside, if you can scrape yourself together, do you want to come and actually learn about COVID and the non-existent vaccine injuries? I’d love to show you.
0	We've got real raw herbs God Gave Us. I'll stick to that.
1	It’s 99.9% unvaccinated people in hospitals. Vaccine works full stop.
1	"Vaccination is a symbol of resilience and human ingenuity—working together to overcome a global challenge."
1	It cause of the vaccines the kids died from measles take these anti vaxxers to Kenya to show tou how to fix measles with lemon aioli and sage extracts blended with cacao from the Peruvian mountains
0	Hmmm as I have an autoimmune issue I think I will just let my own system work it out
1	Just got Covid middle of October, had the booster nearly three weeks before, my symptoms were mild and sickness short. My roommate on the other hand did not get a booster and was suffering really hard for it, hit him pretty hard. Vaccines work!
1	"I got vaccinated to protect my elderly relatives who are more vulnerable to severe outcomes."
0	If this is so safe - why aren’t the pharmaceutical companies held liable as other companies are, please explain why so many young healthy people are being buried ? Athletes in their dropping like stones. Why don’t the people being flooded across borders invading other countries not forced to take it.
0	Wont even give my dog the vac
1	Phizer vaccine: Heel area swelled plus bottom of foot was painful and tender too. I couldn't walk, stand, or clutch my semi. Had to quit a great paying local trucking job because I was a truck driver and couldn't walk or do my job. Life sucked for about 6
0	You're hilarious if you think I'm taking even 1 single vaccine
0	This aged so well. Even my elderly parents are like “no more vaccines”. They blew all the belief in the medical establishment in 2 years…
1	The difference between COVID19 and common flu is not how deadly it is - it’s that there is no vaccine, and the most vulnerable cannot be treated and die. So the reason for cancelling events is not to prevent mass death, it is to prevent it spreading to reach vulnerable people.
1	I have the GTFOH variant
0	I think the vax should be a choice not forced. I have never been vaxed or the family I won't take it got COVID once I never got it again Iso I won't take it for a few reasons but religion is not one of them
0	How much money does it take to buy a politician? Ask a vaccine producer.
0	A local girl had the vaccine and died the next day
0	highly appreciated invention
1	My husband and I are getting close to 60 years old, and he has health issues that place him in the high risk group for serious complications if he gets COVID. We was extremely happy when the vaccine became available to us. We have had every booster available and will continue to get them each year or however they are recommended.
0	I don't believe the media's narrative on the urgency of mass vaccination.
0	Praying for every vaccinated individual May God be with you
1	It’s absolutely insane how much misinformation there has been about the covid vaccines.
0	When a person/government is forcing you to do something , you don't have to research or prove anything, you have to refuse it by default because they want to hurt you.
1	i wanna get the vaccine so bad but my parents won't let me, but i turn 18 in a month and i am fully ready to get vaccinated then
1	Vaccines have played a crucial role in reducing child mortality rates globally.
0	I'm part of the control group. Every experiment needs one
1	Karens: vaccines have microchips. Me: bruhh, we havent even officially evolve to flying cars yet and you expect people to make highly advance DNA changing liquid
1	I didn’t think that this was a question that needed discussing. Of course everyone* should get the vaccine. Never have I ever even considered not getting it once there’s enough for everyone.
0	Why are we forcing kids to get vaccinated for diseases no one gets anymore?
1	my mother was the head of rabies and polio vaccinne production in Pasteur Institute Indonesia...once there are seminars on vaccinations and one anti vaxxer parents confronted my mom and her coallague.  my mom was so angry, after she is done those parents leave the seminar snifling and got suddens inspections from children wellfare service. oy idiots anti-vaxxer, seclude yourself.  dont ever bring polio, rabies or whatnot to the society, you morons!
0	Feel sorry for all the people who thought they were doing the world some good for getting there vaccine. Pray for humanity
1	I’ve had the vaccine and all the boosters. Just got the new booster today. My husband is unvaccinated because he’s a weirdo with some kind of allergy to vaccines. His arm blows up and he gets a crazy rash.  Anyway, we both got COVID in January. He was out of commission for a few days feeling pretty crappy (he’s 45 and healthy, no preexisting conditions). I’m same age and physical status and had only a sore throat and stuffy nose for about 48 hours. I don’t regret the vaccine at all. Only side effects I’ve had from them are soreness in the arm.
1	<-- Stagehand here. Get the vaccine so we can have an awesome 2021 concert season. I miss you all.
0	Wait and see long term effects ....... Thalidomide side effects didn't show up right away. Did they?
1	Was on the fence and worried when I learned I'm finally eligible. I just finished making my app for my first shot. I will be the first to get it in my house, hopefully to show them that it's ok and they don't have to be scared. I just remembered that we were all vaccinated for numerous things when we were young, it's nothing new and not something to be feared. Get it for your family if not for yourself.
0	This aged so well. Even my elderly parents are like “no more vaccines”. They blew all the belief in the medical establishment in 2 years…
0	You can stick your poison vaccine up your ass!
1	Ah I remember those innocent times when we vaccinated only had 6 months to live
1	t amazes me that a generation brought up on GMO food, McDonald’s, fast food, processed food, vapes, recreational drugs, prescription medicines and pollution are suddenly worried about what they put in their bodies. Just SMH
0	Have you listed on your show the slew of problems you can get after taking the Vaccine?
0	I agree with the anti vax people
1	I got vaccinated because I want to travel and explore the world again. Vaccination is a requirement in many countries, and I don't want to miss out on those experiences.
1	Today I got the first dose of the vaccine (astraZ). Good luck guys
1	ahhh congrats on the vaccine, friend!!
1	Pfizer has saved the whole world
1	This man is an idiot. Vaccines are health-motivated (and effective) and have been required at public universities for decades, even before there was a pandemic
1	Most recent vaccination in December 2021. Didn't catch until November 2023 & even then only mild symptoms for a few days
0	Nothing says trust the science like " you can't sue us if something goes wrong" from the shots.
1	I am right here, and I will be your crazy vaxxer friend. Vaccines are some of the coolest technology that has been developed in the past couple hundred years, and I say that as a Kindle addict. You are giving your child the opportunity of a healthy future that your friend's kids won't get.
0	The vax prevented COVID-19? That is false.
1	Just imagine being the pro-vaccine doctor who probably has 15+ years of studying, looking at countless studies, and practicing medicine only for a wine mom with zero understanding of medicine to tell you "you're wrong."
0	There's too much conflicting information out there. I don't know what to believe.
1	Hey @joerogan  compared to the unvaccinated, the vaccinated did better every day of the pandemic in overall mortality and serious illness. Stop getting your news from instagram.
1	When I got my first dose I wasn't "sure it was safe". I got it anyway.
0	Unvaxx here and will never get jabbed, however I did get Covid. Wouldn't have even known if I didn't loose taste and smell, even though I'm "high risk" because I'm an overweight smoker with high blood pressure.
0	but if it really works, why is that pharma companies producing that COVID 19 evade legal sanctions and no liability if it fails, since they said it is effective (theoritically)…
1	Thank you, Dr. I will be sharing this article, and I've got my vaccinations, because I dislike the hospital and dying.
1	I'm an Icu nurse and we still have alot of patients like Christopher. It seems like they are getting younger now and they end up dying. When did vaccine get to be a dirty word? I have seen a few people who were vaccinated end up on a ventilator but most are the unvaccinated. I think a life is more important than arguing about the vaccine. I have seen rare adverse reactions to the flu shot, like guillane barret,but nothing from the covid vaccine, that I am aware of anyway.
1	support for Dr Fauci & the vaccines . Happy Sunday, Brittney
1	Totally normal. That’s why I switched to phizer with the booster and updated one
0	Glad I said no to the jab and stood my ground despite the challenges from friends and families. I don't trust the system, period.
1	....and with ALL that 'education" .....  &#x200B;   MD's  kill 300,000 people in US hospitals EVERY year with AVOIDABLE errors.....700 a day BTFW!  and Rx drugs kill another 150,000....so YOUR point?
0	The right to informed consent means being able to refuse vaccines without penalty.
0	My sister-in-law dropped dead from that vaccine! Sadly she had coronavirus early 2020, and fully recovered from it! Myocarditis is one of those side effects. The only reason I didn’t get the vaccine, I already had coronavirus. Now, I’m anti vaccine!
0	Sadly the covid vax wasn’t a vaccine. They changed the definition of vaccine to include the covid shots. Massive marketing campaign by big pharmaceutical companies and the government.  They have lost the trust of millions for at least a generation.
1	3rd booster and still alive...
0	I'm young and healthy, so I don’t see why I need the vaccine.
1	get vaccinated to protect against covid
0	The doctor told me I was vaccinated against covid 19, so far iv had covid 19 more times than iv been injected with the vaccine, and ironically up until I got vaccinated I hadn’t caught covid 19, so from my personal experience I was definitely not told the correct thing by my doctor, but hey my doctor told me I was immune yet iv caught it multiple times since, so that must mean I’m just a crazy conspiracy theorist.
0	I was anti some shots, now I am anti them all. Not sure about Rabies
0	If a person or government is forcing you to do or take something, you don't have to do any research or prove anything, just refuse it by default, because they want to hurt you.
1	I was vaccinated and i checked myself if i had any side effects, but luckily i just had fever and a week later i asked my husband, and he did it too! thank god we were not much affected by the covid
1	I am VERY pro-vaccine. Was willing to ginnea pig this vaccine for humanity. Anyway, I had to read about mRNA vaccines on the CDC website to set my mind at ease. If this video can freak me out, I worry about it being misused by others.
1	Anti vaxxers are so passionate about this topic because it’s the first time their lives they’ve felt so intelligent
1	Woo hoo vaccine I got mine a while ago I got mine on the first day 11 year olds could get it sooo yeah I'm fully vaccinated feels amazing
0	This is the only vaccine in history that has an "acceptable" death rate. The side effects in some are bizzare. Isnt it your job to have concern about this and not try to belittle people that do?
1	"There's no more polio in the United States so why should we vaccinate". Because of how globalized the world is, that's not going to stay that way at all. And you can take polio off the vaccination list when it is completely eradicated.
1	I'll be getting mine soon
1	I absolutely believe that in mass its safe. And I highly suggest others to get it. But I’m one of at least 3 people who had… a very specific and scary issue about 6 months after the first shot so for my own sanity I’ve not gotten another since the first booster. I don’t like to spread it though, its not like 3 is numerically significant even if its 3 in the same area of a specific state.
1	100% vaccines work! simply review the facts!!
1	I’m personally thankful for this and every vaccine I’ve been afforded in my lifetime.
0	I can tell you I had a horrible reaction to the Moderna vaccine back on August 17, 2021. I have suffered for almost 6 months now from pain and suffering. It started right after the vaccine. I only had on shot. I think everyone should have the right to choose but after what happened to me I wish I never took it. I wouldn't be having to deal with pain and suffering now if I just listened to my senses.
0	I'm unvaxxed, got a bowl of popcorn and a soda getting ready for the drama of a lifetime.
1	No shits given for anti vaxxer idiots.
0	All of this was a scam and planned with the world economic forum and Bill gates's depopulation agenda.
1	But from my point of view I agree with some experts argue that preventing any infection at all is not always the point of vaccine, the goal of vaccine program for Covid-19 is not necessarily to get to 'Covid Zero' but to remove its ability to cause serious disease, hospitalization and death. It is not the problem if the type of vaccine that we receive if different, the real purpose is to give our body enough protection.
1	I honestly wish I could have volunteered for the vaccine trials. I'm a full time mother of three, though, and couldn't take the risk. I'll be, masked, in that line with you.
0	My body, my choice. Saying no to vaccines for now. #NoVaxxDecision #MyChoice
1	I think that every place that has lots of people in it should require vaccines
0	This was not a vaccine. It take years to make a vaccin, not weeks.
0	lets not forget unlike all the other vaccines out there, the FDA has not fully approved any of the COVID vaccines yet because they don't have enough data to say its okay except for emergency use authorization.
0	Biggest mistake of my life was taking the shot to get my wife out of lockdown. 2 years later and I still have heart problems and thrombosis in my legs. F the entire medical mafia.
0	Then Pasicron, Quirvovirus, Ratifariant, and Suprakill will be boosters, 5,6,7, and 8, it will never end.
0	Why they want to give a vaccine to older people? Why is it so they can die faster?
1	just got my initial pfizer vaccine, due for my second dose in 3 weeks!
0	Military Intel says COVID was a globalist plan to kill off millions of people in the next 20 years . The majority of young people below 49 who got their shots won’t see 50 . They are doing what the nazis tried to do . It was simple really just create a pandemic
1	As a contact tracer one of the most important parts of doing my job successfully is, without judgement, inquiring about people's hesitation around COVID-19 tests and vaccines, and providing good information to clarify points where they are confused or fearful. Almost always, resistance to the vaccine is rooted in fear and lack of understanding. With the assertion that every person has the right to make the decision to get vaccinated whenever they feel ready, providing good information as a person qualified to do so almost always makes people more open and willing to have a positive conversation and even change their opinions against the real, good science that has been done to help people against disease.
1	What is good to see is just how few everyday working people around the world are anti vaxx. They scream so loud and congregate for rallies to make it seem like huge numbers, but in reality they’re a minuscule amount. And it’s nice to see that tiny amount suffer the consequences. Their idiocy has caused this pandemic to continue way too long, and too many politicians are pandering to their bullshit.
1	Just got my Moderna 1st shot! I’m excited:))
0	Deaths like this are noted publicly. Therefore it should be straightforward, if labourious, to compile and go through various lists of high-ranking international athletes in various sports, either medal winners or, say, all team members in the top 20 teams in the NFL, Major League baseball, Champions League football, etc.) and see how the rates of unexpected deaths amongst these supposedly healthy individuals in the primes of their lives have changed since the vaccines were introduced. Remove those whose cause of death is clearly known, e.g. a car accident., and you might have an interesting graph.
1	Got my 2nd COVID Vaccine yesterday  I'm grateful I didn't suffer from any side effects from it! I'm gonna contribute that to being hydrated and hopped up on vitamins
0	You won't be telling my cells to do anything.
0	No it just causes variants that the 💉 doesn’t protect you from 🙄 I’ll just stick with my God and His all knowing to create a beautiful balance of my body to protect me. I’ve already had the 🦠 and overcame it so I’m good. Praise the Lord for being my doctor.
0	EVERY SINGLE ONE of these doctors should lose their medical licenses. There are legal and ethical problems with any doctor pushing treatment on anyone but to do so in this way is simply disgusting.
0	I won’t take this vaccine when it took magically only 1 year to make this when they have looked for years for other vaccines and still can’t find one
0	If the vaxxes would work, as you and me understand this to mean, they wouldn't be given away for free. Obviously they work, for the Cabal. Last I checked they have administered over 11 Billion jabs worldwide. If they didn't work for the Globalists, they would have stopped being offered after the 1st billion jabs (or even earlier and place all their efforts in starting WW3 and/or death by starvation/famine).
0	Rushed = accelerated
0	Decreased appetite
1	Right having sourced the paper you are quoting from now. They are saying further research needed. Agreed And “Given the effectiveness of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines in preventing severe illnesses, hospitalisations and deaths” So more research, carry on with vax as best option.
1	I am going to take AstraZeneca since in Australia getting that is optional and i can take it right away but if i wanted biontech i will have to wait and i really don't want to wait i just want to get this over with honestly.
1	And it's going to keep mutating into stronger and stronger variants... Get vaxxed.
0	If the vaccines are so low risk why did the UK recently state as their public policy that vaccines should not be given to those under 18  because the risk of serious health side effects and hospitalization was higher for under 18 from the Covid vaccines than Covid ?
0	When I got the 2nd c shot, my arm was in pain for months and I couldn’t carry things like a plate and then the nerve that runs down my arm felt like it was out of place or something because it hurt a lot,and I could feel it moving,Specially when I would move my arm like to reach for something. It was like that from april2021-January 2022. I did lots of metal detox’s and iv ozone therapy. I never got any of the other c shots. During the summer I make fresh lemonade with honey and once winter starts, I make oregano tea with lemon and honey and it keeps my immune system going and I have avoided getting sick. Don’t think it’s necessary how many rounds of the c shot people got. I mean how Many was it, like 4?
1	In the US the public has paid for a highly effective and minimally detrimental vaccine. If one chooses not to partake, there should be adverse consequences.
1	I'm 25 and got both my vaccines!
1	I was so naive. I thought everyone would rejoice that we developed a vaccine so quickly.
0	I already had covid, 4 days of headache and body aches and that’s it. I also have asthma and am completely fine. No vaccine for me
0	Temporary one-sided facial drooping
1	Well you can always catch Covid 19 and have a far higher risk.  Boosters are needed, it’s a small risk compared to what Covid can do to your body.
1	I’m getting the Pfizer vaccine tomorrow. I can’t wait
0	I absolutely agree. Putting such an artificial untested substance in our body is messing with Mother Nature and the way our genes have evolved to be.
0	Far more people died from lack of basic medical treatment and vaccine damage than covid 19
1	Im unvaccinated and alive. The best part of it is not getting myocarditis.
0	this is a total lie…
1	Thank you. I got my vaccine last year on November. And then I was fully Vaccinated. Yes I did got somewhat sick but it got better again. Same with the second one. But it sucks that I end up getting covid because of my brother who got it from work. 😒but he didn't get vaccine.. he had it worse.. and am surprised he still alive.. me and my daughter is fully Vaccinated. But we end up getting covid. Ya I didn't get sick I did get medication and my daughter got slight sick but not dangerous. 😔it's been hard for the both of us.. but we are staying home. People should be Vaccinated.. it well save your life..
1	I’m vaccinated so are my family, friends and relatives. I’m sick and tired of Covid-19. I just want normalcy back.
1	Finally, I got my pfizer fully vaccinated already
1	Sniffle It’s hard for me to think of a future where we don’t have the right to spread highly preventable diseases. What are these people thinking?
1	Just today I read in a comment section that the vaccine killed more people than covid. You could have all the proofs in the world and this folks would still believe a TikTok Video from a stranger, if he reassures their opinion about topic xyz
0	13 billion doses injected. Mostly in the western world. It's all part of the plan. ANY new vaxxines will have the MRNA included. If you are not killed by it you will be infertile. The elite want the population under 1 billion. EVERYTHING BELOW IS IN MOTION
0	Now I’m rearing the vaccine has been found to have human so what ever disease is in the DNA has been pumped into people that’s why I’m glad I remain unvaccinated, now all the people that looked down on the people that refused to get vaccinated wished they hadn’t
0	As an unvaccinated who suffered a lot of discrimination, thank you so, so much for your  honest opinion, Dr. Campbell.
0	Wow hpw much did pfizer pay to get this published?
0	Dangerous side effects,25% chance of heart attack
0	The COVID vaccines were designed to be an immunotoxin for the purposes of degrading ones immune function to make them dependent on medical institutions. Honestly, what did you expect from the disease mongerers.
1	I got my updated booster a few weeks ago. Later that day my husband tested positive. He got really sick, while I never did. I know it takes a week or two for the vaccine to work but I still think it helped.
1	Yes I'm glad I got the vaccine.  Also, other than the 0.001% of people that had an allergic reaction anyone that regrets it is misinformed.
0	When you experience symptoms of something you’ve never felt before, immediately after taking a brand new medication that had zero long term clinical trials…. Yeah of course it’s something completely natural and not to be looked into further
1	Shoutout to all the healthcare workers and scientists working tirelessly to vaccinate the world
0	This didn't age well..all my friends that got the covid vaccine are sick and all my friends that didn't are fine
0	My father got a covid booster vaccine on the 23th of November '23. I found him the next day. He had died within 24hrs of taking the booster. Please, don't let your loved ones get a vaccine!
0	My concern with the COVID-19 vaccine lies in the lack of transparency from pharmaceutical companies. I feel there's a potential conflict of interest that might affect the safety information we receive.
1	Great informative column that reinforces what's been known and said for quite some time now for those willing to seek reliable guidance. It's easy to do. But the anti-vax crowd and the other ignorants among us refuse to acknowledge facts. They put others at risk. Unfortunately, that is the U.S. these days.
1	I'm immunocompromised, and the more I see of people doing this it gives hope. Thank you
0	Dangerous, deadly, and no thanks!
0	I've never seen so much lying and deception surrounding any one particular topic before this one, in my entire life.
1	Not sure why I clicked on this since needles make me gag but good job getting the vaccine!!!
1	I had COVID 3 times but thankfully all after my initial J&J vaccine. Delta in 2021 did suck, the other two times were more like mild colds.
0	😂😂😂😂 next Joke please!! We have had enough! Without being rude... Go take a nice long walk off a short Pier.... Be my guest enjoy your vaccine. Bye
1	If you want a chance to a long life get vaccinated.
1	Hospitals should deny admitting those who refused to get vaccinated.
0	I am unvaccinated and don't have any regrets. And forgetting more and more things each day! It's heartbreaking to watch!
1	Why are people against the vaccine ? I'm reading every excuse, but puzzled at the main reasons.
0	Yes of course, thankfully my tinfoil hat has saved me from the BS
0	They are NOT safe but are effective at depopulation and control .. fixed it
1	I got vaccinated because I trust the science behind it.
1	I just had covid and I’m pretty annoyed about it. Glad I had the vaccine and paxlovid to make it not a big deal. But still, wish people would mask in public so that we can all protect each other from long covid
0	The only thing to know is that I will never take this poison.
0	Think it's ridiculous that we're expected to trust the word of politicians and bureaucrats when it comes to matters of science and medicine
0	The only thing to know is that I will never take this poison.
1	Got my vaccine today, and it feels like there's light at the end of this long tunnel we've been in.
0	The Covid Vax has killed or injured more people than any other vaccination in history that has been pulled from the market
1	Long term effects of covid suck, please get the vaccine.
1	India is a major buyer for the Oxford vaccine. We have started vaccination drive with that.
1	I just got my booster Tues. Suck it anti-vaxxers.
1	Husband and sons just got their boosters (4th dose) in Gatineau. The clinic at 75 Boul De La Gappe, QC, takes walk-ins from Ontario. There has got to be a way for us to make this easier for people without cars. Hint: ON could open up #COVID19 vaccine boosters to everyone 18+ now.
1	The man that refuses a vaccine because of conspiracy, don't deserve to breed.
1	Vaccines were invented for a good reason, and they work.
0	The covid vaccine is doing more harm than good now if had been in testing for the 5-10 years it should’ve been before being released than I’d get it but until then nope
1	hi! i'm a pfizer trial participant. my father and brother are also participants. we're feeling great!
0	My very healthy 90 year old friend got vaxxed and her nose started bleeding and she was dead a week later.
1	GET VACCINATED.
1	There are many heroes emerging during this pandemic. These guys, arguably, are at the top of the heap!
1	The vacinne is clearly the one major success in this terrible Covid time. It is the one thing that buys us time until better cures and vacinnes are developed. Anti-vaxers are anti-freedomers. Just. Get. Vacinnated. Just. Get. On. With. Your. Life.
1	The moment I was vaccinated, I felt a wave of relief and gratitude. It symbolizes not just a personal shield, but a communal bridge to safer days ahead.
1	didn't hesitate to get vaccinated because I knew it would reduce my risk of serious illness and hospitalization
0	Me too!! The ones that didn’t vaccinate were the smart ones.
1	Second shot is making me feel like I just ran a marathon. My body aches, my skin feels sore to the touch, having headaches, fever and chills. It sucks. Still glad I got it though bc I am asthmatic.
0	WHO I'll skip my jab. You can take it yourself
1	Even if you had 1 person will minor concerns (not death or debilitating side effects), totally worth it - statistically.
0	Never ever ever trust the government. They've proven this time and time again.
0	The biggest regret of my life was “trusting the science” not necessarily for me - i’m already old, but because I also took my kids to get vaccinated
0	Covid 19, a chemically made virus was manufactured in the lab in Wuhan so the experimental gene therapy aka covid vaccine could be used, TOTALLY DEMONIC
1	You know the answer.  Vaccinated people are less likely to spread the virus.  Unvaccinated are more likely.
0	When will I get the vaccine? NEVER!!!
1	Holy shit, the comments are full of anti-vaxxers and people agreeing with them… What is so hard to understand? The doctor gave simple statements that are easy to understand, if you want elaboration just go study the immune system. The body’s immune system is extremely complicated and its acquired immune system is even more complicated (that’s the immunity that deals with the new pathogens that enter the body and try to find the most optimal solution to get rid of the pathogen quickly and then it remembers that way so if the same pathogen re-enters it can deal with it before it spreads inside the body). The vaccine is there to basically help your immune system deal with the pathogen (virus in this instance) quickly before it spreads in your body and damages it. When a virus infects a cell, the immune system has to kill that cell so it won’t continue to spread the virus as well, imagine how many cells can be infected in a week or two weeks which is the common time for your acquired immune system to deal with an unknown pathogen inside your blood and cells, if the body successfully gets rid of all the infected cells and the virus, a lot of damage will have already been made (think of it as a result of a war) this damage might be enough to cause permanent harm. So as to avoid this damage the vaccine helps the immune system by letting them know about that specific pathogen so that they could figure out a way to deal with it so when it actually enters the body will remember it and kill it before it spreads. The immune system can deal with that same pathogen if it re-enters the body in 2-3 days, that’s how efficient it is when it knows what it’s dealing with! The immune cells that remember the pathogen are called memory B cells and memory T-cells and these different types of these cells exist for EACH specific pathogen that enters and each one has a specific lifespan for example the lifespan of a memory B-cell for pathogen 1 is just a year and the memory B-cell for 2 is 20 years, so it’s different for every single virus and pathogen and variant so that’s how specific it is, this is an oversimplified version of how it actually happens though. This is how the Covid vaccine works https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/coronavirus/in-depth/different-types-of-covid-19-vaccines/art-20506465 The immune system is so extremely specific that if one thing is changed about the virus it won’t know how to deal with it and will have to restart the process of learning how to deal with it again, this is why the vaccine won’t help the body fight the new variants as efficiently as the variant you get the vaccine for but it might help and this “might” could save your organ or your life or someone else’s life and that’s enough of a reason to get the vaccine. For everyone who says the doctor is wrong, do you know the immune system works? I learn this in high school ffs
1	My sister had a reaction to a vaccine and can't get certain ones. She's still pro-vaccine.
1	When the polio vaccine dropped in 1955 people lined up to get it, & we were 2 years away from artificial satellites. Now in 2021 we carry external world-brains in our pockets & there’s robots on Mars and idiots think the COVID vaccine is full of wizard poison.
0	I like that "Massively Accelerated"... not rushed
1	I understand getting a booster doesn't mean I won't get covid, but there have been statistics out (at least with past boosters) that indicated they had some level of protection against infection for a period of time (particularly right after getting the booster.)
0	Being pushed to vax. Not sure how I feel about that.
0	I am an Australian who declined the vaccine & so my government employment in mental health was terminated, I now am self-employed, poor but very healthy.
1	I've been fully vaccinated since Dec. 2020 through Oxford Astra Zen eca. After watching this video I need to have more sympathy to those that admit they made a terrible mistake. Ma'am  pray that you can beat this virus because the unvaccinated need to listen t you. It's become a matter of life & death. May God bless you maam !!
1	We all knew the vaccines weren't 100% effective from the beginning. It's not about eradicating Covid right now, but about reducing the death-toll. If we can slow down the deaths / eliminate as many as possible, that would be fantastic. Eventually, we will be able to treat this as easily as we treat the flu, but we need time.
0	My mom died from a seizure from the vaccine
1	I would rather have someone get forcibly vaccinated than having a hippie mom give me measles.
1	I’ve never been more excited to get a vaccine in my whole life. I used to be against it but at the end of the day I’d rather get the shot than Covid.
0	I’m unvaccinated and will continue to thoroughly research and remain unvaccinated.
0	Yes. You can die when your vaccinated. Car crashes, drowning, bleeding out, burning to death, starvation, and neglect. Why don't you go throw away the vaccines and let kids who cannot access vaccines die out you dumb shit
0	I’m unvaccinated and will continue to thoroughly research and remain unvaccinated.
0	side effects..becoming a zombie! CDC already outlined that from being a human lab rat.
1	First covid 19 vaccine done! Remember. By choosing to be vaccinated you save those who are more susceptible
0	Exactly the risks is more serious. I would never put that vaccine in a child. He speaks as if heart failure is not a greater risk. Their way of thinking is so unethical.
0	Haven't had a vaccine in 6 years, I recommend we quit vaccines for less threatening diseases.
1	I appreciate the clear explanation. I think one of the reasons there's so much resistance and conflict has more to do with politics than medicine or science, it has become almost a political stance to hold a
1	I feel for people who drink and drive in a car accident. But not as much as I feel for the non-drinkers they injured or killed and the emergency workers that had to deal with the aftermath. And I may feel a little mad that the driver ignored the hundreds of “don’t drink and drive” safety messages, or the similar number of news reports about drunk driver fatalities. It’s the same with anti-vaxxers, especially the vocal ones. It’s sad they died but they had all the information they needed, their choices took a toll on others, and emergency workers have to deal with the fallout.
1	To those who are vaccine-hesitant, let's listen to each other with empathy and understanding. Open dialogue is key
0	This validated everything I knew and further confirmed that not getting the vaccine was the right choice.
0	There is no debate. That is a bioweapon. Anyone tied to the distribution, and implementation, should be executed
0	I'm anti-vaccine and im proud to be i regret doing any vaccine
1	Be SMART get vaccinated.
1	I really hate how antivaxxers use autism as a fear mongering thing. especially since I'm autistic myself. it sucks to have a group of people use the way I naturally am as a "bad side effect", something that you don't want and should avoid. like, gee thanks, I love having the way I naturally am used as a fear tactic and portrayed as a malevolent disease /s
0	My brother is head nurse in a trauma unit in metro Orlando. His hospital forced that jab on everyone on shift one night without warning. Two weeks later while he was working, he had a stroke. Thankfully, he was at the hospital and received immediate care. He had to stay 3 days in ICU and is now on daily anticoagulants. So much for "safe and free effective!
0	I am glad I watched this because it helped me realise that the shots are certainly unsafe.
0	It’s now 2024 and State Surgeon General Dr. Joseph A. Ladapo calls for a halt in the Chinese Communist vaccine due to HEALTHY human genes are being transformed into cancerous cells.
0	"We don't have a good grasp on how long protective immunity lasts from either Cov or the vaccine." The wiggle room on this is awesome for the people who stand to profit from these vaccines.
1	YES YES YES PLEASE END THIS PANDEMIC
1	there’s a chance of reinfection and spreading it. If we all get the vaccine that won’t happen
0	Every CDC NIH and FDA aspect of the plandemic has ben fraud since day one, including the clot shot.
0	Good morning Dr. Campbell. Thank you for such a professional and easy to understand predation. I have had many friends and family members die unexpectedly including my own mother. I didn't vaccinated and very thankful to God and you. God bless
1	Behind the scenes at a recent Covid vaccination clinic in Llangefni. Older age groups have are now mostly fully vaccinated. Please encourage younger people to get boosters to protect them against the approaching Omicron wave. Clinics at Bangor and Penrhos Thur/Fri #KeepWalesSafe
0	Dont take it guys
1	So thankful for the vaccine it's a huge relief
0	I can't wait to get my 16th booster shot to finally end this pandemic!
1	I would get vaccinated because I prefer being alive.
1	When I win the lottery, I’m going to offer a secret trip to an antivax mom or two and land the plane in some third world country with malaria and dengue and perhaps a case of smallpox and see what they think.
1	Let's encourage everyone to get vaccinated so we can put an end to this pandemic.
1	Is she a doctor or scientist? No. Then she can F off on fake antivaxx propaganda
1	I am grateful my parents and school vaccinated me ...I saw kids that where very affected growing up
0	I’m a public school teacher, I am 100% going to be taking a vaccine as soon as possible to make sure I don’t spread anything unintentionally to my students or colleagues. When we have the tools to stop suffering, we need to use them.
0	I didn't get the vaccine, so I have no worries about side effects on me.
1	I just got my third dose as an immunocompromised person!  At the hospital I work at, 1/3 of our patient population has Covid. Most are aged 40-50 and only 2 of the 68 Covid patients had both of their vaccinations. You’re not invincible!!! People are on 100% oxygen with saturation’s in the 80s. Delta is scary as hell.
1	Grateful for the COVID-19 vaccine, a beacon of hope in challenging times
1	I felt like I got covid early and displayed symptoms of long covid, after getting vaccinated they went away.
1	Lol I came from a video with lot of anti-vax people. I just gotten my second dose 2 weeks ago but nothing happened. The stuff that they said that would happened never did. I wonder were there getting there information from because it's sounds like a cool movie to see.
0	I'm sure all of us could list several health problems we've seen in friends and family after receiving the shot.  My 28-year-old athletic co-worker died in his sleep, another coworker had a stroke, my son's best friend (19 years old) had a seizure right there in the pharmacy and had to be transported to the hospital by ambulance (where they blamed it on a non-existent fear of needles), my brother-in-law had to wear a heart monitor for irregularities right afterward, my sister-in-law and nephew say their anti-anxiety meds no longer work for them like the used to, my husband's co-worker swears his arthritis has never been worse, a neighbor developed blood clots, and I could go on and one, as could all of us.  I will never get the shot, nor will my husband or children.
1	Puting your child AND everyone around not old enough or with medical conditions that prevent them from being vaccinated, its great to see you eventually got vaccinated :)
0	I will retire and live meager before ever getting that shot. Had my resignation letter ready in the event the Supreme Court went “broccoli” on us.
0	What about long time side effects? Ten years out? Five years? Hell, let’s go with one year out?
1	Let's not forget that vaccines have eradicated deadly diseases in the past. COVID vaccine is our way out.
0	I'd rather have natural immunity than play Russian roulette with vaccines
1	It's not required, but not getting it at this point is just stupid
1	Got the COVID vaccine today. This is amazing. So happy to be able to get this!
0	And yet major companies are still pushing the vaccine on people.
1	Oh my goodness, you described my decision making process with this so well it’s scary!!! My two kids have a total of 6 vaccines but I did do the J&J.
1	I've had my vaccine, and I'm feeling thankful for the layer of safety it adds as I go about my daily life.
1	get vaccines and improved immunity.
0	Friends have died. Friends have been injured shortly after receiving the jab. Family members have had heart attacks and others have had drastic health changes in the last 2 years. One person developed turbo cancer.
0	For the second dose, I felt like I got hit by a bus, launched into the sky, then hit by a plane knocking me into a food waste garbage truck.
1	Getting vaccinated is a responsible choice for the greater good of society.
0	By not taking the jab, I'm 100% safe from side effects and 99% safe from covid.
0	It weakened those that got it or killed them.  As well as those they shedded  it on.
0	Thankfully someone is speaking about long vaccine injury. I have been suffering immensely since the first one and each one after. I took the first 2 and the first booster which nearly finished me off! My GP wouldn't have a word said about the vaccine and still won't even though I'm still suffering. Medical gaslighting is real folks, please try and stand your ground xx
1	This reminded me of my mom's reaction to people who won't get it- "more for me!"  And thanks for the old school references. A nice smile on a Friday.
1	The joy of scheduling my vaccine appointment was overwhelming. It's a step towards reclaiming the moments we've lost.
0	Nobody has lost their children due to vaccinations you complete degenerate.
1	Arguing with an anti vaxxer is like playing chess with a pigeon. You may win the game but the pigeon will knock all the pieces off, poop on the chess board, and strut around like it won anyway.
0	Don't trust anything to do with vaccines
0	With the excess deaths since mass vaccination, not my opinion but worldwide fact, they were smart, not selfish.
0	No jabs for me and I never will be.
1	it's a free, safe health measure that will keep you from getting deadly sick and keep your neighbors healthier.
1	Encouraging everyone to get their COVID shots.
1	If you haven't been vaccinated yet, I urge you to do your research and talk to your doctor. COVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective, and they're the best way to protect yourself and your loved ones from this serious disease.
1	Vaccination is our best defense against COVID-19, dramatically decreasing sever illness and mortality rates. Data shows that while breakthrough cases can happen, the unvaccinated are at a far greater risk. Don't wait, vaccinate!
1	they won't kill you, but all the antivax idiots suddenly don't have parents / grandparents. ZERO sympathy for those dummies.
0	I was fooled into two doses as I used to travel internationally. Shame on you media and propagandists. The data and information that is coming out and was coming out while you were spreading lies is a crime against humanity. There is DNA in the Pfizer vaccine, not just RNA. They messed up on so many levels and you supported and promoted it.
0	No matter the safety or not still can’t predict the future effects in years to come
0	THANK GOD I DID NOT GET THE VACCINE
1	Your next covid-19 infection could be your worst, so don’t gamble with your health
1	If You're an Anti-Vaxxer, You're an Idiot
1	Pfizer gang represent
1	What we feel about covid19 back then ans how we feel about it now is like worrying about yellow 5 from drinking mountain dew through our teenage years and what we feel about it now lmao
1	I can already tell how mad the anti-vax community is. Congrats on the shots, stay healthy!
0	Concerns about the use of preservatives and additives in vaccines raise questions about their overall safety.
0	How many people who would happily have a vaccine, would also happily have a gene editing injection? Because that's exactly what you got with those mRNA shots.
1	With the widespread spread of the Omicron variant, it is crucial to strengthen the vaccination of children.
1	Prioritise those vaccinated.
0	98% of all people who get any variant of COVID do live, so.....
1	i'm more than excited to get vaccinated! and because of this video, i'm more than determined to share this towards my family and friends. kudos to the team behind this video!
1	I also got the vaccine in October, and had no noticeable symptoms except a slightly sore shoulder where the shot went in. I could still comfortably sleep on that shoulder.
0	I personally know of four that died after their first jab.  Two others now have rare cancers after their jabs.   Must be climate change!
1	t is sad Antivaxers are dying in record numbers in Arkansas. The health care workers would be smart to relocate to other states, where they won’t be overwhelmed with trying to save people who can NOT be saved.
1	I support the French governments vaccine strategy 🇫🇷Show your support, dont let demonstrations against be the norm
1	Officially on Team #Moderna, no fooling! #GetVaccinated and #MaskUp
0	The only question I'd ask the reporter and anyone else: "How can you be suuuure, the vaccine is safe?"
0	By not taking the jab, I'm 100% safe from side effects and 99% safe from covid.
1	I have a guy at work that is anti-vaccine and by the gods it takes everything in me not strangle him until he turns a color that resembles a smurf being held underwater.
1	Great, where can I get a Pirola Novavax vaccine? I’d like to stay up to date with the current variants, since XBB.1.5 is long gone
1	Except antivax types believe anything free is a conspiracy leading to socialism. Or so they've been brainwashed to believe.
1	The vaccine rollout has been impressive. Kudos to healthcare workers!
1	If antivaxxers cared about facts this would mean something.
0	I would just like to ask has anyone continued to take their 2nd dose after experiencing similar symptoms as me? And if you have continued to take the 2nd dose, would it ok to share what was your experience like?
1	vaxxed and relaxed, that's me now, no more stressing every time I have to step out
0	My daughter was pregnant in 2021, and it was a high risk pregnancy. The pressure she was under to vaccinate was tremendous, bordering on coercive. They didn’t just “allow pregnant women” to get it, they PRESSURED women to get it. It’s criminal. She resisted, thank God.
0	I’d never get that vaccine, period. Benefit absolutely does not outweigh the enormous risk.
1	Also side effects are also quite common but shouldn’t scare you away. I had a fever 3 times and now I have cramps and tummy aches but they’re all part of your body building anti bodies
1	people need to get vaccinated
0	Just another thing to profit on. They play with our lives
0	Amen! Most "anti-vaxx" are actually mislabeled. The are "pro-choice" vaxx and believe in individually evaluating the efficacy of each vaccine, against the side effects and risk of taking it. And most pro-choice vaxx are that way, not because of some conspiracy theory, but because of a personal negative reaction rosa vaccine in the family.
1	We need more women to advocate for vaccines like her.
0	For true informed consent, side effects like myocarditis should have been disclosed before administration. It was not which is against the Nuemburg code
0	They would have to hunt me down, fight me, and restrain me, to get that stuff pumped in my body.
1	Natural selection at it's finest.
1	well the vaccine does work
0	People who are anti Vax aren't very smart.
1	MAGA Anti-Vaxxers believe 6 million Jews died from the jab during the Holocaust. Oh wait, these shmucks don't even believe the Holocaust happened in the first place. smh
1	People saying vaccines are a government plot need a reality check. It's about public health, not a conspiracy.
1	I hadn’t been vaccinated in 23 years (two life threatening reactions when I was little). But I decided that the risks of COVID were high enough, and the mRNA vaccines are different enough, that I got the vaccine anyway. It went fine and now I have much more peace of mind.
1	As someone who has seen friends suffer from severe COVID-19, the vaccines give me hope that we can prevent such suffering in the future.
0	tested only on mice
0	I dunno... long-term effects are still a big question mark.
1	Let's make vaccination a symbol of unity and solidarity
0	I think the side effects are underreported and not taken seriously.
0	The bible warned us about this
1	Got my vaccine passport ready to go
0	No thanks, I'm trying to cut back on my poison intake.
1	3rd dose #Moderna. As a healthcare worker more than 6 months out since my 2nd dose, I feel relieved to receive this booster. Keeping myself, my loved ones, & my patients safe.
1	conspiracy theories blowing up, stop spreading misinformation!!!
0	And this is to convince me to get the vaccine? Not.
0	I'm not going to get it. I've had three vaccines and Covid twice. I developed chronic daily headaches, beginning the night of the bivalent vaccine. They are still going strong and it's been 8 months. I had almost never had a headache prior. I wanted to report the negative effect but there was no way to do so.  My UCLA doctor said I should probably skip this next booster. I can only imagine how many other people have been negatively affected by the vaccine.  I'm grateful for the initial vaccines when Covid was so severe, but now, I'm not going to risk another long term complication.  I'm glad it's a personal decision.
1	If we all get the vaccine we will be safe. Trust the science.
0	Same thing happened to my wife Aunt. Took it and didn’t make it 48hrs
0	Covid restrictions got tougher after vaccination 💀💔. Lasihlabelani
0	A lot of experiences about the disgusting abuse and blackmail people have endured in getting this. I for one have lost 9 people to this experiment,  my auntie was the most recent one 3 months ago.
1	I am ready for the vaccine. The owner at my work just told us he will give us a paid week off once we all get vaccinated, I love that he is convincing people by way of incentive
0	I've never been vaccinated, and I've never gotten COVID. I have a Doctor who was vaccinated several times, and she got COVID twice... I also have a friend who never had a health problem in his life, and less than 2 weeks after getting the vaccine he was hospitalized with swollen lymph nodes around his heart (which constricted his breathing). He now has Hypoglycemia, Graves Disease, and anemia. I'm not sure if it was the vaccine, but it all happened immediately after.
0	I heard a Dr. say a couple weeks ago that most people won’t see the effects from the shot until about 5 years after taking it
1	I believe in what vaccines do
0	Those people who did not get vaccinated are happy there's plenty of people that got the vaccination who are not
1	I,m a social activist, i strongly suggest all to take vaccination to get-rid of covid
1	Anti Vaxxers don’t need any help to look stupid.
1	If the pandemic is fake, then wtf I have I been utterly suffering with for the last 3 days?
0	I don't know anyone that refused the jab regret it, but I know a,lot of people that got the jab and regret it.
1	Here in Thailand, we barely have any vaccines, people are desperate to get vaccinated, and less that 10% of us are vaccinated. It feels very unfair that Americans just shoo it away when so many of us would have it in a heartbeat.
0	Glad I said no to the jab and stood my ground despite the challenges from friends and families. I don't trust the system, period.
0	I have several friends who I've known for 20+ years, so I know their history. As soon as they took the vaccine, their bodies went haywire. I didn't take it (and never will), and I'm just fine. The other 8 people I know who have had no health symptoms - all unvaccinated. Although some of the vaccinated people I know haven't had ill effects, it's about one per week now - who ends-up getting shingles, or needs ankle braces (a common side effect from the vaccine). I work at a medical clinic, so 'm thinking - I know a little bit more about this - than your average Joanne.
1	I urge everyone to get vaccinated and do their part in ending this pandemic.
1	Why should those of us who cared enough to be vaccinated be put in danger by selfish people who refuse? It is the selfish people’s turn to stay home. We care about our country and others and play by the rules. We want business to thrive.
0	COVID shots were not vaccines and did more harm than good.
1	Know the call proper explanation of the vaccine efficacy statistics, and get the vaccine
0	Unless the definition of rare has been changed to mean 'happens a LOT' then these side effects aren't rare.
1	Getting your flu shot and updated COVID-19 vaccine offers the best protection against serious illness.
0	My best friend died from a cerebral hemorrhage at the age of 77 in 2020 before there was a vaccine. My friend was healthy, happy, and vigorous, and my tennis partner for years. He was also very intelligent, and generous.
1	Let's hope for the best and take better care of ourselves.
0	Who's 'excited' about neverending boosters
1	The global effort to develop and distribute COVID-19 vaccines is a testament to human resilience and scientific progress. I'm confident that these vaccines are our best tool in ending the pandemic and saving lives.
0	The Covid shots are definitely deadly and have killed over 17 million as evidenced by the data put out there by thousands of medical doctors. More people die from Covid shots than firearms fired by humans
1	thank god i learned about vaccine.saved my life
1	When you get a vaccine it’s a less severe form of Covid 19 that lets your body produce antibodies for it so if you ever do come into contact with someone who has Covid you will be able to fight it off I’m pretty sure
0	Never got the Covid Vaccine, I am very lucky. My grandparents got very sick after the shot a week later.
0	The way this whole thing was handled has turned me complete anti vaxx. I hope everyone effected gets justice.
0	I'M NOT TAKING YOUR EXPERIMENTAL VQX! YOU MAKE IT YOU TAKE IT!
1	2020 is clearing finally
0	Sad story... My 64 year old grandmother who followed all covid 19 protection rules for the past year passed away after 3 weeks of taking the vaccine. It was so sudden coz she didn't exhibit any problems until the 3rd day before her passing.
0	I'm by no means 'anti vax'  But, this last year or so there has been a spat of people I know, all young and healthy people... having heart attacks and strokes.
0	Side effects scare me. Not sure if it's a risk I wanna take.
0	I have a higher chance of getting struck by lighting than dying from Covid, no thanks
0	Too many mixed messages about the vaccine. I'm out.
1	I got my second dose last week! So grateful to the folks in my community for volunteering their time to ensure anyone that wants a vaccine can get it. I hope others are utilizing the heck out of that link!
1	As a 27-year-old musician, I got my appointment within an hour of them going up this week, because I. WANT. TO. PLAY. SHOWS. AGAIN!!!
0	Your guilty conscience is showing. You know damn well that covid vaccine is dangerous as hell.
0	Prevent vaccine injuries.
1	many people lack in their understanding of vaccine
0	That junk is in no way fitting the description of any vaccine and is in no way following bona fide protocols of medical science in it's development and deployment. The only science in this has to with creating pathogens of biological warfare.  Ignore cnn and by all means, do some research.
1	Fantastic work in our arsenal against the AV plague dogs. Thank you.
1	without vacination, it kills many more people, and has legacy symptoms.
0	Remove restrictions on vaccine requirements and restore the rights and freedoms of Canadians
0	Pro vaccines people blindly trust anyone in a lab coat they cant name 1 ingredient in any vaccine, ended taking a experimental vaccine that in the end gave them 0 protection.  They then put on a mask that gave them 0 protection.   And demanded the un vaxed do the same cause they got duped
1	Got my booster today. So smooth I had to check to see if I had a bandage.
0	I will NEVER regret NOT getting that shot.
0	I commend the people inMalawi. There are many people that have been jabbed and had Bell’s palsy, blood clots, guillándonos barre syndrome etc. My Dad took it a few weeks ago and now says his back is constantly itching and in pain. If you want to get vaxxed… do it but don’t judge others that don’t want it.
1	I can’t say it enough but after a long shift it needs saying again. Please get vaccinated if you are pregnant. Covid vaccination is safe in pregnancy Covid is not. At best being Covid positive will ruin your birth experience.@MFTnhs @WythenshaweHosp  @MFT_SMH  @NorthMcrGH_NHS
0	its the same vkrus passed around in the shot. ppl
0	Safe and effective, tell that to the people who died or are disabled.
0	What absolute BS this was  A psyop from the very start. #scam
0	Get your next shot, and the next one, and the next one, and the next one, and the next one, and the next one!! (Ps:  sarcasm)!!!
1	Hmmm... would I rather take the vaccine or catch Covid? I got the new vaccine already, and yes, I do stay up to date on my vaccinations. Why are people even wondering whether they should get it or not?
1	Here is a great reason to get vaccinated. Long Covid otherwise known as Post Covid Syndrome or Long Haul Covid doesn’t go away. I got Covid in March of 2020 and have been almost completely incapacitated for 22 months now. It would be wonderful if you made a similar short documentary on the people not getting better for years.
1	Vaccines work when everyone uses them. There are a small number of people who cannot be vaccinated due to medical reasons. They rely on others being vaccinated. So when a lot of people who can take the vaccine refuse to do so, they put these people in danger.
0	You're hilarious if you think I'm taking even 1 single vaccine
0	Proud to be Unvaccinated.
1	Please go out and spread the word... Of getting Vaccinated. Such exciting tech.
1	Glad to know that there's another vaccine, #SputnikV, has comeforrh with approval against this dreaded virus.
0	I've read about vaccine injuries and the cover-ups. No way am I risking that for a supposed 'protection.
0	I nearly lost my job from vaccine mandates but I stuck to my guns & didn't take it.
0	don't call me an anti vaxxer dear, the name's mrs doubt pfizer
1	Anti vaxxxers are selfish Morons who don't care about themselves or the people that care about them.
0	My family and I refused the vax and will remain unvaxxed. Decision was primarily based on my knowledge of thalidomide combined with many like you stating vax not safe.
1	If it gets me back to the football they can inject it in my bell end
1	Let's show COVID who's boss and get vaccinated.
1	My experience with the COVID-19 vaccine was smooth, and the minor side effects were a small price to pay for the protection it offers. It's about weighing the risks, and to me, the risk of COVID-19 is far greater.
0	If it’s made compulsory then it should be safe for everyone and it’s not safe for some people!!!!
0	I am glad I watched this because it helped me realise that the shots are certainly unsafe.
0	It's already the fault of covid vaccines....
0	The so called “ anti-VAX “ group wasn’t against science or even all vaccines we wanted to see more research and choose for ourselves what’s right for our body. Thank God he protected us.
1	My kids both got their #COVID, #Influenza, and #HPV vaccines today!
0	Covid vaccine spike prions. Prions form abnormal aggregates of proteins called amyloids, which accumulate in infected tissue and are associated with tissue damage and cell death. This is where the blood clots are coming from.
0	‚ÄúThe vaccine was not brought in for COVID.  COVID was brought in for the vaccine. Once you realize that, everything else makes sense.‚Äù ~ Dr. Reiner Fuellmich
0	This is just another pharma infomercial. I hope everyone watching this knows the entire purpose of this report is to sell shots.
0	At this point, 4 years since the beginning of the #covidscam, considering all the evidence of #vaccinedeaths & #vaccineinjuries, the fact that people are still posting #IStandWithTrudeau is proof that mass hypnosis works. #safeandeffective #Liberals #Agenda2030 #TrudeauForPrison
0	Total nonsense.. I’m betting she’s a sales lady for big pharma
1	congrats South Africa. as a Nigerian I don't know how to feel about these vaccines, they are expensive, my government is inefficient, and to be honest I don't know if these should be our top priority as this is not exactly a major problem here according to the statistics an seeing
1	Proud to stand with science and get vaccinated. It's about saving lives
1	Honestly some people are little too dramatic. I haven’t gotten the vaccine yet but I have nothing against it.
0	If before people were skeptical of vaccines, the way the handled this pandemic made it so much easier to be a disbeliever
0	I've had constant neurological symptoms since 10 minutes after my vaccination. Next month will be 3 years. I was so blindly pro vaccine. All it takes is to be one of the few who reacts badly to change your whole view on them.
1	The vaccine is our best shot at returning to normalcy.
0	I am unvaccinated.  My heart goes out to those of you who aren't.   It must be like living with a ticking time bomb.
0	Did you even end the flu with vaccine? You cannot vaccinate a virus that’s mutated. All we need is to have a strong immune system. That’s it.
1	Thrilled to have received my second #PfizerBioNTech #covid19 #vaccine!
1	For the first time in history, the ineffectiveness of a medication is being blamed on those who have NOT taken it.
0	The only thing to know is that I will never take this poison.
0	Why are you all so desperate for us to get the ‘vax’ If you are so worried about it then go get it for yourself, if you are protected then why should you care if I am or not, that’s my risk to take
0	How many in the study died from the shot? They always seem to leave that number out.
0	I made the mistake of getting it (Moderna) so I could travel - in Sept of 2021. 38 year old male, never been to doctor for any disease or health related problem. Have now had chest pain for over a year, high bp, constant headaches and had to get put on beta blockers as well as getting stress test. Wish I would have listened to my instincts on this one. I hope all that got it make it through this alive. I'm glad the young lady didn't back down in the face of the smug interviewer.
0	For every kid who died because of vaccines 1000 died because the lack of it you absolute ignorant piece of stupid ass Karen mom
0	Still unvaccinated, and couldn’t be happier.
1	The COVID-19 vaccine was an essential requirement for my compromised immune system.
1	Even though my wife is just part of a tiny gear in the Biontech machine that takes care of the vaccine, I couldnt be more proud that she goes to work everyday saving the world :)
1	The data shows that vaccinated individuals are less likely to spread the virus.
1	Doctors need to be telling them to get vaccinated
0	Still don't have the shot, tell me when I am supposed to die again
1	Good job, anti-vaxxers. I hope you enjoy that blood on your hands, 'cause it's gonna get thicker.
1	Its not a flip flop, it's an AWAKENING to TRUTH AND FACTS! WHO IS STILL ASLEEP?
1	"Vaccination is a powerful tool to minimize the impact of the virus on vulnerable populations."
0	"For the near future, it will be necessary to review the correlation between vaccinated individuals and deaths from myocarditis."
0	The thought of injecting my baby with so many vaccines at once just feels wrong to me. It's overwhelming.
1	I will be getting the vaccine asap. My parents are both in several high risk categories. I have been so scared for them and want to protect them as much as possible.
0	A Message for the Vaxxer Movement...  Cry us a river. Build a bridge.
0	You should wait on getting it especially if you're a teen bc it hasn't been tested on teens.
1	There is nothing haram about vaccines what was this imam thinking
1	i'm a history nerd, so i learn't about what happened to people back in the day before there were vaccines. i couldn't imagine living in a world without vaccines.
0	Nobody should be getting them.
0	Sure, I understand the importance of Vaccination. I've had every vaccine but Covid-19. The thing is, I understand clinical trials are supposed to take four years or longer, to actually deem a short term and long term response. The biggest difference is, I'm not a test subject.
1	I got vaccinated, and guess what? I'm not in the hospital. Coincidence? I think not.
0	The only shots I take come from a liquor store. OPA
1	We are more than 95% confident, and that's good enough for me. The whole world was built up with gambles of waaaay worse odds than this... it's honestly a miracle we've made it this far without nuking ourselves out of existence.
0	It's all about personal choice. I'm choosing not to get vaccinated.
1	A few studies have also suggested being vaccinated causes you to be less contagious and for a shorter period. So gaining protection through vaccine is also superior when it comes to protecting your fellow humans.
0	Why would I regret taking a shot that arguably has more downside risks than potential benefits?
1	Stop me. I need to take a few deep breaths. So many people around me are anti-covid vaccine for NO VALID reason other than they don't want to be told what to do. It's such a narcissistic point of view. They haven't studied the science. They're just sheep. I'm just so sad.
0	i got covid once in all these years i havent been vaxed and ive been fine.. i havent been ill in over 6 months meanwhile people i know who have had multiple jabs have had terrible coughs for weeks and other illnesses
1	Fuck yea. I dont want to die
0	Pure blood here, keep the faith No vaxxers
0	15 of our personal friends who are over the age of 60 developed strokes,thrombosis,pericarditis,pneumonia,and all have died,and this 2-3 weeks post booster shots
0	Remember when they said the unvaccinated would die? I'm still here and quite healthy. My other peers, who got the shot because of fear, aren't doing so well.
1	All vaccines in the country are safe for use. Before a vaccine is certified for use, it must receive approval and authorization from WHO.
1	In the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, the rapid development and distribution of vaccines are key to returning to a sense of normalcy
1	78% of Americans have been vaccinated already. Why so many thoughts? Get vaccinated.
0	Sister in law had a stroke caused by blood clots after her first AZ shot.
0	Okay. But then what about the diseases that you can catch from not being vaccinated? If you catch a disease that can be prevented with vaccination, there’s a high possibility you could spread it to the newborn who had not gotten the vaccine yet. That wouldn’t be very fair, would it? Also it’s kinda dumb to avoid getting protection from diseases just because, according to YOUR studies, it makes you more prone to colds. So, stop being a smartass and vaccinate the hell out of your kid (if you have one or if you’re gonna have one). Heroic people have gone through hardships to create these vaccinations that could potentially save the world from diseases such as measles. It’s people like you that let that hard work go to waste. But, of course, you’re entitled to your own opinion. However, it’s a FACT that vaccinations have given so many people a better chance at life, and that cannot be proven wrong.
1	I got my second Moderna vaccine on April 5th 2021. Had no significant post-vacination symptoms after the first dose and none after the second until last night (5 days later). At midnight I was awaken with severe vertigo. I never experienced vertigo and, at first, my thought was "this was the end of my life". After a few seconds I slowly promted myself to sit and just breathe. It helped until I attempted to get out of bed.......    Being a retired medical professional, I started to self diagnose myself, realising that my hearth is functioning very well therefore it cannot be the end of my mortal life. After a while I realized that I may have a reaction to covid vaccine. Started searching the internet and that was unhelpful until I found theVeDA sight. In this time of pandemic and many unknowns, it was a blessing to learn that there are other people experiencing similar symptoms after various number of days post vaccine.   I still  highly recommend covid vaccines, but would like to encourage vaccinated people to post their symptoms. It will help us patients and medical professionals know that immunity building can produce LATE  symptoms. This knowledge will safe our minds and money spend on unnecessary doctor visits and use of medical diagnostic tests.   Official medical sites are waiting for real data analytics,  which takes a long time to collect and produce. In the meantime, we humans are participants and need real time answers for our problems. Knowing there are other people in similar situations as ours is of tremendous help.
0	Absolutely NO way!! I'll take my chances.
0	On friend went for a full physical at the doctor and was said to be in very good health . So he went 2 days after the physical for the jab. Next day after the jab he was not feeling so good week later they said it just side effects 2 weeks later died of heart failure . And guess what they said it not related to the jab
1	that is only in the US. Im from the Philippines, and people here are actually mad at the government for slow roll out. We want our vaccines shot asap if we can have it. People line up outside the streets of vaccination clinics for hours to get their shots. We dont have good health care being a 3rd world country, so if you get seriously ill from the virus that might be it for you. And everyone just want to come back to work with as much protection as we can.
1	Wonderful to know all vacine can avoid the death
1	This has saved so many lives
0	Considering the Pfizer and Moderna haven’t finished their clinical trials yet I would say that you cannot draw a concrete conclusion to the risks of the vaccine.
0	My husband had a heart attack weeks after getting the MODERNA VACCINE. He can barely walk now and has to sit wherever we go. We cannot work since I am now taking care of him full time, which is ok because I love him. But I feel so alone and the doctor even had the nerve after to say that the symptoms he has been experiencing after the heart attack, are psychological..
0	Wise man Joe! Spot on. There is no good reason for anyone young and healthy to get that poison.
0	So many people that got multiple jabs I know are always sick. It was an experimental unapproved drug. A disgrace by government and big pharma.
0	Afraid of turning into a cyborg hybrid creature if exposed to too much modern technology
1	Vaxxed life is the good life, because staying healthy is the real wealth.
0	Zero benefits all deadly results
1	The vaccine gives us hope. Let's embrace it and move forward.
1	The vaccine was ready in January, and took a weekend to develop, which just blows my mind. I really hope this new mRNA method is able to give us vaccines for other diseases so fast.
0	Got my information from alternative sources; won't be getting vaccinated. #AlternativeInformation #NoVaccineForMe
0	Still do … many jobs are stilled closed ti the unvaccinated in Australia
0	I had AZ, I was 62 it was my first covid vaccine and I'll never have it again I can assure you, I never experienced anything like it with any other vaccine in my life, it floored me and almost 2 years later I still have side effects , and I only took a second covid vaccine because of pressure from family! which I waited as long as I could because of the adverse reactions to AZ I was determined I wasn't having it again nor did I, instead I had Pfizer thankfully not as bad but I decided then and there I would never have another nor any booster!! I'm trying to get as well as possible by myself, what made it worse was not being believed when I reported my side effects to my local GP, I truly believe prayer and Asprins saved my life!
0	I just don’t understand the point of any of this. I think it’s smart to get vaxxed if your doctor thinks it’s best for you. But vaccines don’t prevent the spread of Covid, they reduce the severity of the symptoms. Being unvaxxed ultimately only poses a threat to the individual, and anyone who is vaccinated should not be concerned, considering they can contract covid from both vaxxed and unvaxxed coworkers.
0	My coworkers have all gotten the vaccine. One had a heart attack at 30 (3 shots) and the other (3 shots) has had a stroke, followed by subsequent TIAs. He just went to the cardiologist yesterday for an EKG and they immediately called him back for a 24/7 heart monitor.
0	Our beautiful people being led to slaughter in the name of profits.
0	Im unvaccinated and alive. The best part of it is not getting myocarditis.
0	I'm unvaccinated and I don't wear a mask and I feel healthy, wealthy and wise. In fact I feel terrific. Stop listening and watching the mainstream media and your life will change for the positive.
1	As the UK Prime Minister confirms to Parliament today that "unequivocally … Covid vaccines are safe”, it is worth bearing in mind that: 1. MHRA rules prohibit the unqualified use of the word “safe” to promote any prescription medicine, and the MHRA now publicly states only that the benefits of Covid vaccination "outweigh the risks" in the majority of people. 2. The NHS website only goes as far as to say that vaccination is "the safest way to protect yourself from COVID-19”. If the PM is so certain - even in the face of those ruled to have been injured or killed by a Covid vaccine - he should surely now instruct
1	This time, I could only get the Pfizer and all my previous vaccinations were with Moderna. This time, I didn't even have a sore arm and didn't have any other side effects.
1	I got the COVID booster + flu vaccine last fall and this fall. Haven’t had either covid or flu since. I am around kids in poorly ventilated rooms without wearing a mask quite a bit, too. So, for me, it’s worth it.
0	No I won't get that shot why so I can still get sick and still have to wear a mask what's the point
1	I sleep so much better at night knowing my favorite people are almost definitely not going to die from this disease
1	it’s already killed tens of millions of people.
0	The financial corruption with this business is so out of control I don’t know where to begin. These people are despicable. They certainly don’t care about the health and welfare of the people.
1	I got the moderna and was surprised by the intensity of the inflammation, actually felt feverish for a bit. Reading up on the tech behind it it’s no surprise, it’s designed specifically to render the fastest and strongest immune adaptation possible. Honestly getting those side effects made me feel confident I’m in the vaccine actually working properly
1	been fully vaxxed for months now, no issues, life's pretty much back to normal, feels good man
1	Trust me this vaccine is safe! i'm a living proof
1	got my second dose of pfizer yesterday! not as bad as i thought
1	Vaccines are one of humanity's greatest achievements. From smallpox to measles to COVID-19, they've protected countless lives and improved global health outcomes
1	Got first shot of Pfizer on Friday,a bit of headache and muscle discomfort in my arm.That's it so far.
1	Getting vaccinated is not just a personal choice; it's a collective responsibility. Together, we can build a shield of immunity that protects the most vulnerable among us.
0	NO vaccine for me.
1	Kindly introduce more vaccination program centers in different Places and also make more positive awareness on people about the importance of vaccination. Thanks
0	I'm pretty sure the only thing worse than catching a contagious disease is getting stuck with a giant needle full of mystery juice.
0	R.l.P for those who will take them.
1	I got COVID. I did have to be in the hospital, but I know beyond a shadow of a doubt that my being vaccinated saved my life. I got a much, much weaker case having had the vaccinations. Before my talk with the doctor I was anti vax. I'm so happy that eventually I decided my doctor was more educated than myself.
1	I have to say I am relieved to see how many people want the vaccine. I was worried about the anti vax population but all I’ve seen so far is people begging to get it
1	What do you think most medicines are made of? Most are refined versions of what's found in nature.  If you think doctors in general are looking to kill people you're more diluted than your homeopathic remedies.
1	I got my shot to protect my family and friends from the virus.
1	I'm next in line to be vaccinated for COVID-19 but I don't know when or how am I going to feel if it does.
1	Yes. It's so amazing how good these vaccines are. I really good that they can start mass production soon
1	I’m on my 15th booster shot and I feel great ….unreal
1	It cracks me up how many conspiracy theorists think the government was using these vaccines to inject microchips into us, ignoring that the government already has more than enough ways to track everything we do thanks to our over reliance on cell phones and computers. Like literally, we willingly sign away our rights to privacy the moment we sign up for a cell phone plan and internet subscription. No reason to waste money on insanely advanced tech.
1	If parents choose not to vaccinate their children that is fine because that's their right. But, parents who don't vaccinate their children need to respect the rights of schools and daycare to refuse service to individuals who don't adhere to the regulations and rules to enroll. Parents who don't vaccinate their children need to find schools and daycares that allow non vaccinated children
1	I have an autoimmune condition that I have to to get infusions to suppress my immune system for.  I caught covid three days after said infusion to kill my b-cells and I had a fever for 14 days, terrible body aches, blacked out in the shower, and was not eating. Sometimes I think the people blessed with great health assume that's the case for everyone, it's not.  You have people with cancer, immunosuppressed, diabetes, obesity, etc. I got two doses of the vaccine prior and I do wonder if this virus would have put me in the hospital if I didn't. I just know that ultimately God has allowed me to breath and walk another day and for that I am thankful.
1	Thank you, Pfizer/Biontech! I received my first dose this week, and am so grateful.
1	My husband is home bound and finally received his second Covid Vaccination. I thank the local health department as it was hell trying to coordinate this happening. They are trying. Thank you.
0	the covid vaccination rate is pretty much pointless at this part unless we’re only counting people who have been vaccinated within the past 6 months or recently got their booster. instead of 65% of the population having 95% protection against covid it’s probably much worse
0	Dangerous and defective.
1	I was unvaccinated and last October my family all tested positive during the height of delta. My parents in their 70s had their 1st shot and they got mildly ill. I was taken by ambulance to hospital, ended up in icu in an induced coma on a ventilator for 21 days followed by 1 month of rehab learning to walk again. I was revived one time during the intubation as they'd lost me. I'm now triple vaccinated.
1	Got my vaccine and feeling fine, better safe than sorry
1	It’s almost like the vaccine is safe and effective, who would’ve thought
0	They haven’t been tested rigorously they haven’t even had enough time to do proper trials
0	I can’t wait to never get any of those vaccines ❤
1	I'm gonna be getting my first shot next Tuesday! I'm a tad bit anxious, but overall pretty happy!
1	I wish the vaccination prevented you from getting COVID at all…
1	The muscle pain is normal, my arm was also hurting when I got it, I am fine now, nothing serious. But idk what to say about the short breath one. I mean, its way better to get the vaccine then to get covid.
0	Not to be a sceptic, but doesn't anyone find it a bit strange that the vaccine has been developed and put into production / passed through so quickly? I thought from what I've read and researched that to be sure a vaccine not only is effective but also safe takes a long time. Longer than what's taken thus far.  I surely won't be taking it.
0	Messing with our genetic code can't be good, right?
0	My mother in law has deteriorated so bad constant headaches, rashes, and can’t remember Anything after her shots. Very active and mentally smart prior. Doctors deny it was jabs some nurses say opposite but afraid to say otherwise. I have zero trust in most doctors today.
1	Booked to get mine soon! : )
1	Soooooooo excited for this vaccine!!! Thank you to all of the scientists who are working so hard to make this happen.
0	"Thank God I didn't get vaccinated."
1	Your shots give you your best chances, especially together with masking, hand-washing and so on. Are they guarantees? Of course not. Just the best we can do for now.
0	By not taking the jab, I'm 100% safe from side effects and 99% safe from covid.
0	My mother died of a stroke after her second vaccine. She’d never had a stroke before
1	I got vaccinated because I believe in the power of herd immunity. By getting vaccinated, I'm not only protecting myself but also those who cannot get vaccinated due to medical reasons.
0	No way and I’m doing just fine, so are my unvaxxed family members. The ones who got the shot, not doing so well.
0	That guy is a criminal with stock or kickbacks from Pfizer Moderna . These people are soulless demons
1	I got the second vaccine shot of COVID a week ago and so far I'm fine.
1	My biggest question is long term side effects. We have no way of knowing until it's too late. I fully plan on getting this vaccine, but it's still a major concern.
0	This is this doctors last chance to convince you to get the horrible arm candy shame on these people. Truth is out here. Go look
1	Well 2 weeks ago i traveled with my relatives around my country. I spent 2 days with them and then we went separataed ways. They tested positive while i didn't.  Probably the kind of vaccine takes role. My 1st and 2nd was sinnovac and the 3rd was astrazeneca. My relatives got their 1st and 2nd astra and the 3rd was moderna.
0	Purebloods unite!
1	My parents just got their #2ndbooster This really should be referred to as their #firstbooster. Your primary series should be 3 shots w/ #moderna or #pfizer to be considered #fullyvaccinated.
0	A salute to the unvaccinated
0	Vaccines are just a way for doctors to make more money.
0	It blows my mind how many people actually took the jab. It was so obvious what was going on...
0	Covid Vaccines Are Officially Deadliest Drug In History and Nobody Is Allowed to Talk About It -
0	Research here showing that the EXCESS DEATHS are not from LONG COVID, but are indeed from the vax:
0	There's a lack of long-term testing for the COVID-19 vaccines, and we're essentially unaware of what the future side effects might be.
0	I'd bet no one in this pic is vaxxed. Why would they poison themselves.....
0	The beginning of the end.
1	Iit's a small joy that, even though the covid vaccination programme has been primarily aimed at adults, someone high up approved the development and production of stickers for everyone who got their shot. They knew how nice it would be for those grown ups to get a sticker.
1	It allowed me to travel. Otherwise it didn't bother me either way
0	Regret not getting #Covaxin is that what you’re saying? @elonmusk
1	There are *very few, and rare* legitimate medical exemptions for the vaccine. Proper facilitations should be made for them, but that’s it
0	My uncle had a heart attack 1 week after getting the Pfizer vaccine, lucky he survived, but is in constant pain. My aunt also started having uncontrollable shaking and tremors.
0	THANK GOD I DID NOT GET THE VACCINE
0	Fun fact: pfizer ceo has not taken his own jab cuz "he doesn't want to cut in line." Can y'all believe that? What a nice and considerate person he is!
0	This isn't being skeptical. It's being smart!
1	If you reject a vaccine, you’re an antivaxxer. And a dumbass.
0	Covid vaccines are safe,if you don’t take them😡😡
0	I am in the category of let me decide what I want to take and not take. Leave the decision up to the person’s own body and mind!!!
1	Got my vaccine! Everyone do the same for a safer future.
0	“The vaccine should be tested on politicians first.     If they survive, the vaccine is safe.  If they don’t, then the country is safe.” —  Monika Wisniewska
1	When I took my 2 vaccines I didn't have any of those side effects
1	I had my first shot a few days ago. The only side effect I had was a mild headache and a slight tender arm. Only lasted a few hours.
1	YESSSS GOD. Yasss lawd. Whew!! Can’t wait for January-April when we get this vaXXXine and we can go back to normal!!!
1	I am glad that my family and I got our vaccines! We did not experience any side affects either! 👍
1	New research shows antivaxxers don't care about science... Or facts in general
1	i wanna get the vaccine so bad but my parents won't let me, but i turn 18 in a month and i am fully ready to get vaccinated then
0	I can't trust what I don't fully understand, and these vaccines were rushed. My family's health isn't something I gamble with.
1	Only 90% effective, because 10% antivaxers won’t get the shot.
1	That’s because most of the groundwork in developing mrna vaccines had already been done for years and years. This wasn’t “how do we invent a vaccine for covid?”, this was “how do we adapt this proven, well-understood vaccine tech so that it works for covid just like it does for the ebola virus that we originally developed it for?”
1	I feel vaccine refusal for reasons other than immunodeficiency reasons should be neglect and constitute removal of the child from the home.  Also if your unvaccinated kid infects someone who cannot get vaccinated, due to actual medical conditions, should be negligent homicide at the very least.
1	Fully vaccinated and grateful for the protection. Let's all unite against COVID-19 by getting vaccinated.
1	if you're vaccinated, go fucking puta rusty nail into your cut, see what happens!  Also even if getting vaccinated was going to help me against polio, what if it was going to give me brain damage or make me sick?   And even if I agreed, until polio does come about it's not worth injecting crap into us to protect us if it means more neurological and illnesses induced by vaccines.  I wouldn't purposely induce potential illness even if I was vaccinated.
0	The vaccine does NOT work, It too fast and people still get sick. What the vaccine does is push in a small dose of Covid-19 in your immune sys.
1	we lost our uncle to covid. he was such a loving man but he was afraid of getting vaccinated, like most of our family. After his death, my parents started to take it seriously enough to consider getting the vaccine. Unfortunately, that clarity of mind didn't last too long and a while after they changed their minds again. I couldn't get vaccinated as I was under 18 and they wouldn't allow it and soon after we all ended up getting the virus. My father and mother have both been left with permanent health consequences. It is wild what misinformation can do to our world.
1	Vaccine is in, mask is out!
0	Maybe those of us who have been screaming about our vaccine injuries for the past two years weren’t just crazy conspiracy theorists after all.
0	Fully jabbed are getting hospitalized and some are dying.
1	Everyone at first was saying I don’t trust it I’ll wait til it’s been out awhile… now what’s the excuse?
0	Government robots want us killed that is, I am not taking the vaccine
1	Vaccines have been a cornerstone in eradicating diseases like smallpox and polio.
0	If they really wanted the American people to believe in this vaccine then it would have been made visible during all the testing. Where are all these people who volunteered?? I don't trust a pharmaceutical company as far as I can throw them. They're a BUSINESS....and businesses are in it for money!
0	He said vaccine will help reach herd immunity. So far the articles I have read says that you can still get Covid infection and spread it after you are vaccinated.
0	Studying vaccine development prior to the COVID outbreak gave me all the information I needed to refuse the new vaccines.  Best decision I ever made.
1	I would never vote for anti #vaccine person.
0	Make no mistake, I take well tested vaccines, but COVID-19 isn’t one of them.
1	Hearing all the anti-vaxers screaming at the state capital when Newsom signed a mandatory vaccination bill into law was just lovely
0	Looks like the brigadors are here hiding in the shadows, only down-voting people, not commenting for fear of being exposed. Those are the same people who all along were for the vaccine and lockdowns and masks, which we now know were useless.
1	I got vaccinated for my newborn niece. The thought of bringing the virus near her terrifies me. It's a small act of love and protection.
1	Getting vaccinated is a powerful step towards protecting ourselves and our loved ones from the impact of COVID-19
0	My soon to be daughter in law is in medical school to be a doctor and she refuses to get it and neither will her coworkers No thanks!
0	I've heard too many stories of adverse reactions to the vaccine. No thanks. #AdverseReactions #SafetyConcerns
0	I have had no shots and dont plan on gettig one ever.
0	Kudos to all the uninjected!
0	I personally know of four that died after their first jab. Two others now have rare cancers after their jabs. Must be climate change!
0	Liars! The shot kills more people than the disease itself. Treatments are available so no vax is needed. Get rid of the FDA, CDC, NIH.
0	I love your comment! I’m in the same boat! Got the popcorn and hear of ill health/ new diseases/ in the vaccine zealots constantly. Oh well- I did try to warn them. Got abused. Too bad!

0	Dr Seheult,  I feel you have trusted this experimental vaccine too much from the beginning 😡😡😡
0	By not taking the jab, I'm 100% safe from side effects and 99% safe from covid.
0	There is never ever a reason for Government to FORCE any citizen to take a medical treatment.
0	I mean I got Covid then my job forced me to get the 2 shots I got um felt pretty sick for them. Then pretty sure got Covid more 2 times after those shots. So I think personally they arnt worth it especaly with the head acs. Never had a head acs before Covid or the vaccine and sence Covid and the vaccines I occasinaly get head acs.
1	I have a couple of friends with long covid - it has a huge impact on their lives. Both got covid in early 2020 when there was no vaccine available. Why anyone would risk it is beyond me.
1	While I joke with friends that I am on #TeamModerna, I am really on #WhicheverGetsIntoMyArmFirst
1	I am an ER doc in East Texas. received my vaccine last Thursday. I really appreciate the scientists who developed it. I can’t thank you enough.
0	All of the adults I know who took it now either have clots in their legs or are sick at least once every other month. Women's periods either got worse after taking it
0	People regret taking the poison, nobody regrets not taking the poison.
1	I received my second Astra zeneca dose in May. I am currently battling a never ending stream of snot in self isolation having recently tested positive for Covid. However, I am fully aware that whilst I feel rough if I had not been vaccinated I could well be in hospital now. Instead I have an annoying 'summer cold'.
1	I’ve received both shots and both boosters from Moderna, now my pharmacy is only offering the Pfizer bi vaccine, should I seek out the moderna booster or is it safe to cross over? I work in a grocery store, so I’ve been dedicated to staying current.
0	still not getting the Jab, good luck with all that though.
1	It's the permanent damage that covid could cause to bodies which is also significantly lowered by the vaccine.
0	WILL NOT COMPLY ! This is the greatest hoax ever perpetuated on mankind.
0	She left out fetal tissue. Just a government ploy to deceive you
1	You could start by shutting up with your anti-vax, anti-science nonsense.
0	I think there's malevolent stuff in it that has to do with nanotech and transhumanism and the internet-of-things making people — eventually with 6G which is coming after the 5G — where you're biologically tuned into the internet at all times,
0	The vaccine is such a hoax.
1	The vaccine has lifted a weight off my shoulders and allowed me to focus on the positive aspects of life once again.
1	I recommend double or triple doses. It just makes sense.
1	I had a crazy bad reaction to the MMR vaccine when I was a toddler. I still get all my vaccines. It's insane to me that people feel like it's some huge risk. It seems selfish to me
0	Absolutely not. Never again I have crippling depression and reactivated EBV that cropped up after the vax in 21
0	No, I don't trust the vaccine and I'll continue masking myself, social distancing, and constantly washing my hands
0	Many are dying from this experimental jab and especially young people. This is murder
0	Staying unvaccinated to protect my body from unknown risks.
1	mRNA is safer though because all you're doing is making the s protein of the virus which on its own is harmless. The only way you can get anything resembling an autoimmune response is by literally overdosing on a vaccine which would overwork your immune system by overproducing the protein and that's just any drug. It's called dosage. No matter what drug you take. You take too much of it. There will be a problem. These companies have determined the effective dosage of the vaccine is two shots. Two shots in a year is not remotely close to a problem.
0	Oh my gosh, I never got the jab and I’m perfectly fine
0	"That whether a company has done its job well or not seems to be the conclusion of this gentleman, but for me, the important thing is how many people have been affected by an openly malicious treatment."
0	What absolute nonsense! Children get ear infections ALL THE TIME. I’m 40. My daughter had plenty before covid vaccines. I had loads throughout my younger years. As did every child. Stop spreading lies. It’s unhelpful.
0	LIAR!!!!!!
1	Enjoying life's simple pleasures without fear all thanks to the protection of the vaccine
0	I am unvaccinated and don't have any regrets.
1	healthcare would be crippled if not for the vaccine
1	Or, maybe dont jump to conclutoins and blame the covid vaccine just because the internet told you to.
1	Thank you so much Miki, I am scheduled to take my first dose tomorrow. I am nervous but excited. I just want everything to be alright. This video has made me feel less nervous.
0	Really regret it. Still got COVID four times after getting three jabs. Plus my health has sharply declined past two years.

0	Had COVID in 2020. I tested and still have lots of antibodies more than a year later. I know people who had the vaccines and had bad reactions and later still got COVID. I don't know anyone who recovered and get sick again. The vaccine is not worth the risk foe me.
0	the shot does not prevent the transmission
1	I didn’t think that this was a question that needed discussing. Of course everyone* should get the vaccine. The only question I have is timing. I’m in the lowest risk group, so I’m going to wait until there is enough supply for those who are at higher risk to get one first. But never have I ever even considered not getting it once there’s enough for everyone.
0	If you want to get free abortion, you should get the jab.
1	Currently, vaccines aren’t our best defense, if used in isolation, against Long Covid
1	mRNA vaccines have been studied for decades, I'll get mine
1	Yes this injection hurt
1	ngl I been fighting for my life for days now I cannot even imagine having covid without being vaxxinated
1	I'm excited about the possibility of returning to normalcy once enough people are vaccinated. It's a light at the end of the tunnel
1	I just wanna say, I am lucky to be fully vaccinated.
0	The vaccine doesn’t work and you proved that by getting Covid yourself. Israel is the highest vaccinated country. Going on 5th booster. Yet they are still getting Covid. Your money making vaccine doesn’t work.
0	I have never had the flu vaccine, and NEVER had the flu.  I have not had a single covid vaccine and have NEVER had covid, despite being exposed 9-10 times!  It's weird how vaccines lower your immune system!
1	The vaccine has cause adverse effects in many. But to be critical or skeptical of the vaccine, even very mildly, is regarded as anathema. This breeds conspiracy theories.
0	There’s no words that can be used to describe this evil man. NONE!!! Imagine knowing people will die from something and still push it like it’s the best thing on earth. Unreal!
0	All of the anti-vaxxers out there I've got one message for all of you I salute you keep up the good work
0	i'll never forget how people treated me when i told them to avoid the vaccine.. i was already disollusioned with the world before 2020, and what followed just confirmed my disdain. glad theres still some people out there taking it seriously and talking about it
1	as soon as i'm able i'm going to get vaccinated:)
1	I just got my second injection and I feel great!
1	FINALLY BOOKED MY COVID VACCINE!!
1	Hmmm... would I rather take the vaccine or catch Covid? I got the new vaccine already, and yes, I do stay up to date on my vaccinations. Why are people even wondering whether they should get it or not?
1	It's true, people didn't die before the COVID vaccines. They prayed to Jebus for healing and lived forever.
0	I personally know of four that died after their first jab. Two others now have rare cancers after their jabs. Must be climate change!
1	The success of vaccines in controlling disease is one of humanity's greatest achievements.
1	If your child has an autoimmune disorder you should be PRO vaccine, even if it means not vaccinating that child. You need the healthy children around your child to be vaccinated so they don't spread these preventable illnesses to yours
0	The new vaccine for COVID-19 will be the first of its kind EVER. It will be an mRNA vaccine which will literally alter your DNA.
1	I'm 27 and fully vaccinated since February because I work in a hospital. A huge benefit for me has been the freedom from the anxiety of getting myself or others sick. It's such a relief. DFTBA! - Don't Forget To Build Antibodies!
0	More vaccines, yay! We can totally believe the claims this time, totally.
0	it's impossible to ever discount personal experience totally, but the amount of misinformation that people report simply because they beleive their personal experience is fact is insane
0	Easy explanation. The vaccine destroys your immune system. Don’t get any more shots
1	No doubt the vaccines work, but it's germane to note that, as of May 1, the CDC is apparently only accepting "breakthrough infections" when the PCR test is run at a cycle threshold no greater than 28.For the non-vaccinated, the cycle threshold remains in the 30s and 40s.
1	what im getting out of the antivax movement is that some parents would rather risk having a dead child than an autistic one
0	my hair has either turned grey or fallen out and I have become rather grumpy.
0	What to know: Don't take it, no matter what they say. Retired professional nurse here.
0	It sure looks like the state media narrative is changing to blame cardiovascular adverse side effects from the vaccine on the COVID virus itself. Long COVID or some such shit.
1	The study is right there and you can read it yourself. And it makes even less sense if you look at the millions still alive thanks to the vaccine. Can you clarify?
1	Got my first one today. I wasn't against it or anything just haven't really been concerned. Well yesterday my 9yo asked me why I hadn't gotten it yet. And I had no good answer for her. So I went and got it today
0	Covid is just a cold
0	I did not get the clot shot. The surgeon general of my state came out saying the shot is linked to blood clots and heart failure. I’m so glad I listened to my instincts and not the doctors trying to force me to take it.
0	Let’s not forget that hospitals profited from calling everything a Covid death.
0	My mom had two brain aneurisms after her shots and died soon after !!!
0	Man I’m so over all this COVID talk & vaccination shit. Guidelines were put in place & people ignore them & that is what is going to keep spreading this shit. Ya acting like if the whole world got vaccinated this shit would disappear LMFAO
1	I had a friend who was convinced the vaccines cause infertility in women, you might notice I used the term had a friend, I won't be friends with an anti vaxer.
1	Vaccines help your body prepare in case of an attack. Your body will know how to deal with the virus should you ever come in contact with it, and it will significantly reduce your symptoms. Plus, there are so many people who can't get vaccinated. Cancer patients, individuals with autoimmune diseases, the elderly etc. Why has our mentality become "well too bad for them, as long as I'm healthy that's all I care about"?? Are we supposed to just push these people to the curb?
1	Was nervous about side effects, but I didn't experience any.
0	I personally know of four that died after their first jab.  Two others now have rare cancers after their jabs.   Must be climate change!
1	If you give any medicine to a billion people a few thousand will have serious side effects.
1	Super grateful to receive a COVID-19 vaccination today. Keeping myself and my patients safe!!
0	tRuSt tHe sCiEnCe
0	Got vaccinated from peer pressure.  Ruined my life.  Have had a ringing in my ears that will not go away that started 10 days after shot.  If you’re healthy like I was I would say skip it.  I’m miserable now.  Would have never gotten the shot of it wasn’t for family and media pressure.
1	Wow, they did it before the FDA...I'm SO impressed. It looks like their rolling review process really did speed up things.
0	CONSIDER YOURSELVES VERY FORTUNATE. YOUR OWN IMMUNE SYSTEM WILL WORK BETTER
1	Got my pfizer vaccine today. Feeling good, just a little bit tired. Looking forward to putting COVID behind us.
0	Let's be fair you can't believe Corporate Media
1	hell yeah, finally vaccinated
0	Nothing fishy about any of this.
1	Still can't get over all these healthy, rich Americans standing in the middle of New York comparing themselves to holocaust victims. Absolutely no shame whatsoeve
0	The unknown long term side effects makes me nervous
0	Nomatter how many videos they make ridiculing people who do not trust their Jab, WE STILL WON’T take it. Period.
0	Lying, hate vaccines
1	Seeing the rigorous testing and approval process helped me trust the safety of the vaccine.
1	I've got my 7th booster in a months time. Immune suppressed individual here. I'm extremely greatful for the vaccines. I've also never had it. Strangely enough neither has my son though. Who's entire class came down with it, plus his family and he never tested positive the whole time even though he was around them. I also shared pizza with a guy who had COVID (unknown to me untill after the meeting when he tested) and had multiple people I work with have it. Still not had it. I might be a carrier however I make sure I take every vaccine just incase I've just been lucky so far. They're so important and it would be selfish not to
0	Now they care about age, but before when they were pushing their agenda they were lumping all ages together.
1	I never thought I'd see the day where masks would become a fashion statement, but here we are. And soon enough, maybe we can leave them behind thanks to vaccines.
0	There's no such thing as a #coincidence. #DiedSuddenly #myocarditis #VaccineGenocide #vaccineinjuries #vaccinedeaths #arrestFauci #CrimesAgainstHumanity #Nuremberg2
1	Hate to continue spoiling your appetite…. My position is to same. For older and sick people, the vaccine was a godsend.
0	I had the first jab, and I wish I hadn't, total peer pressure and coercion after being made to lose time ten days off work due to being in contact, despite having clear tests. The side effects of that first jab made me realize just how bad a move it was. I've lost so much faith in humanity at how this whole thing was orchestrated.
0	Am I uncool for saying that azteca zeneca vaccine brought back my allergies I really don’t want to sound redneck but it happened and in fucking annoyed at this
1	Just a couple of years ago, we had a scarlet fever outbreak in a refugee camp that we (My family and I) did missions work in. The UNHCR was mandatorily vaccinating all the children they could find. We stopped going out there for a couple weeks because my parents were worried about us kids. We were all vaccinated, but it was a bad outbreak. Anti-vaxxers are an entirely first-world problem. They make me so angry when they call me an idiot because my parents vaccinated me.
1	Lmao, imagine being afraid of a vaccine. All it fucking does is stimulate your immune response it's not this deep.
1	getting vaccinated isn’t dangerous
0	I believe in personal responsibility for my health, not relying on vaccines.
0	Vaccine effectiveness is at best 1%, but has serious side effects!
0	I’m glad I’ve been antivaxx since pre Covid years. I do not regret my decision at all. My kids, my husband, my father in law, and myself are healthy as can be. My FILs both brothers got the jab and boosters and both had strokes. We tried to warn people and were called conspiracy theorists. But every single day I see crap like this that makes me not regret my decision. All I can tell y’all… us conspiracy theorists TOLD YOU SO.
0	Here’s the question: If vaccination is so important, effective, and necessary...then why would vaccinated children be “at risk” by unvaccinated children?
1	omg, i've to admit.. I am so damn jealous.. I'm still waiting on my invite to get vaccinated.. I'll get it probably around OCTOBER, which makes it hard for me to get a new job, to get internships or see my university from the inside.
1	the idea that the individual consumer is right about everything, always, at expense of everything else truly is one of the worst effects of the society at large
1	Vaccine hesitancy is baffling. We've got a solution to get back to normal, so let's embrace it
1	Masking,testing,vaccination, and lockdowns are the main four tools for controlling covid. Taking lockdowns off the table is the equivalent of trying to win the Kentucky Derby with a three legged horse.
1	Moscow Russia everything is open business as usual. Ontario Canada is reporting 1546 cases of #COVID19 465 new cases in Toronto #lockdown Closed business, Church, no family, No Hope #MentalHealthMatters Canada get out of Syria #SputnikV 91.6% effective
0	Literally second time having Covid in less than 3 months & I’m vaccinated. Wasn’t vaccinated until August and didn’t get Covid once pre vaccination. Just a little suspicious bc 2 weeks after getting fully vaccinated I got Covid for the first time & now I have it again. Weird…
1	The vaccines work!! And they are safe! Thankful to the NHS for vaccinating key workers such as myself!
0	Still traumatized from the forced vaccination of many Americans whose livelihoods were threatened.
0	And then u woke up from ur mini cardiac arrest after ur booster..
0	I don’t believe the FDA is telling the truth. The vaccine is not ready yet and people I know who have taken it are having serious side effects and doctors are covering it up.
1	This vaccine is safe and effective. Do not let fear of rare and unlikely events overshadow the awe of this 95% efficacy
1	Vaccines play a crucial role in controlling infectious diseases like COVID-19.
0	Thank GOD I didn’t get jabbed. Feel terrible for all the trusting individuals who thought they were doing the responsible thing. So sad
1	Got my second shot yesterday. A little groggy, and headache. Don't regret getting it. My immune system is working.
1	Honestly, if you think the vaccine is worse than COVID, you're not paying attention to the facts.
1	stop trusting the tweet, get vaccinated
1	Volunteer at vaccination clinic, answer questions, reassure people.
1	I'm glad there are so many antivaxxers, it means more vaccine for me
0	walk and breathe. take steps and take breaths. never stop and you will stay human. I don't believe in this path of our evolution, I don't understand it. when did men become so greedy. why this push. for what?
1	I will get vaccinated. Have had the  four, also had Covid and the antivirals. Heavy cough which is still not totally gone after two months. But, firmly believe that I would have been much sicker without the vaccine. I believe we need to take advantage of every bit of medical advancement we can.
1	we love a vaccinated queen!
1	Here is a great reason to get vaccinated. Long Covid otherwise known as Post Covid Syndrome or Long Haul Covid doesn’t go away. I got Covid in March of 2020 and have been almost completely incapacitated for 22 months now. It would be wonderful if you made a similar short documentary on the people not getting better for years.
1	My entire family got vaccinated, and we feel much safer now.
0	There are too many unknowns with the COVID vaccine.
0	I had so many family members try to tell me that I was reason that COVID persisted because of not getting vaccinated. They are not saying that now.
0	Who should get them? NOBODY!!
0	The vaccine killed my dad, it’s lethal end of story.
0	Not heard anyone say they regretted NOT having the jab.
1	Vaccinated patients have lower risk of long COVID
1	Watching with major chills after second shot. Still worth it
0	This. Vaccine. Is. Bad. Deepest condolences to the family.
0	I am 68 years old,  not vaccinated, never had Covid and perfectly healthy.  In my county we were put under house arrest, discriminated and pressured worse than in any authoritarian regime but we stood our ground and I a  so happy we did.
1	God bless all the people that took the vaccine
1	The COVID-19 vaccine is a powerful tool in our fight against the pandemic. It's a symbol of resilience, unity, and the triumph of science over adversity.
0	I never got the vaccine despite the pressure. I know I'm lucky to have been able to avoid it but others were forced to take it to avoid losing their jobs or getting essential services. Around the time people were getting vaccinated, 2 of my mom's colleagu
1	Already GOT corona and I’m gonna get the damn vaccine. No way am I going through that again.
0	Now after 3 years we can say that the vaxx is not the right thing!
0	My body my choice
1	so you are going to ask a random dude online who has taken it? These vaccines has been thoroughly tested, if you want to know the side affects. Ask your dokter or look it up as it probably should be mentioned on the reader.
0	"Suddenly, many doctors are prescribing deworming treatment."
0	My brother got a heart condition from these things.
1	Let's be real, the benefits of the vaccine far outweigh any risks. It's a no-brainer.
0	PROSECUTION OF VACCINATION OPPONENTS AND COVID-DISSIDENTS @
1	Well I'm convinced
0	vaxxers are the real threat to society, spreading unknown and dangerous substances.
1	I'm grateful for the COVID-19 vaccine; it's our best shot at returning to normalcy.
0	I prefer to boost my immune system through diet and lifestyle rather than vaccines.
0	79 and not wearing a mask or taking death tests or death jabs.
1	DeSantis Destroying public health one press conference at a time
1	In day 4 of isolation. Felt pretty miserable the first two days. Have had all the recommended shots, or it could have been worse. Get your vaccine folks.
1	Unfortunately, the only people who are still convinced that the vaccines don't work are specifically the ones who will not change their opinion when presented with evidence that they are wrong.
1	Phizer apparently did not take money from tRump’s warp speed program. I for one will take a vaccine with this effectiveness. Scientists are explaining that this quick turnaround is possible because of previous types of covid vaccines. I trust the scientists!
1	The end is in sight, many of my coworkers and I are getting our first doses of the #PfizerBioNTech #CovidVaccine
0	Just don't force me to take the vaccine, I am happy.
1	WRONG! IF YOU ACTUALLY LISTENED TO THE MEDICAL INFORMATION DIRECTLY and not to the publicists' interpretation, you would have heard that their pitch has ALWAYS been REDUCTION in both infection probability and symptoms (harm from infection), at least since the vaccines became commonly used.
0	Plandemic is 100% scam, vaccine is scam scam scam
1	Sad to see all the anti-science nuts and their bots downvoting everything. A miracle in science that did great good, and they believe what some shit eating snake oil salesman tells them who is barely qualified to tie their own shoes. Anti-vaxxers are directly responsible for an upcoming genocide as they keep bringing the vaccine rate lower and lower, until we drop below herd immunity in many different diseases. If only they would suffer what they are going to force on children and the immunocompromised.
1	Cheers to the scientists and researchers who made the COVID-19 vaccine possible. Getting vaccinated for a safer, healthier world!
0	As an unvaccinated who suffered a lot of discrimination, thank you so, so much for your honest opinion
1	Its one thing if you choose covid for yourself. It's just heartbreaking reading the stories of people who received substandard or compromised care because their hospital was full of covidiots.
0	The Covid vaccination campaign is the largest mass poisoning event in the history of the world
1	People need to understand, that the more people who refuse to take this vaccine based on unfounded beliefs and misinformation , the harder it will be and the longer and it will take to reach herd immunity, and the longer the lock downs will last. That simple.
1	Came back to Japan where the vaccine rollout is shit. Husband isn't vaccinated and caught covid. We likely were exposed at the same time.I am vaccinated and I possibly have a breakthrough case (getting tested Sunday), all I had was a VERY minor fever, light chest pain, and now just a heart rate increase when I stand. If I wasn't vaccinated I would be SCREWED.
0	Convenient for big pharma!
0	The UK govt data shows significant non covid excess deaths. Same govt data shows a 44% increase in heart attacks. Given that the vaccine is known to damage the heart, is seems a logical theory to explore.
0	If women can say my body my choice about abortion, then I can say the same thing about vaccines, which btw abortions are far worse than a shot.
0	Over 300K people have died from taking the vaccine in the US alone.
1	I did get all 3 shots and I’m glad I did my whole family caught covid in 2022 but it wasn’t bad just like a cold!
0	It’s not just the immediate effect it’s the long term effect
1	My parents got double doses of covishield. I got one shot. No side effects.
1	I think the vaccine is safe for most people but not everyone.
0	It won't reach me! I won't take the koolaid!
0	I really need to get a vaccine for a virus with a 99.7% survival rate. Hard pass.
0	The shot Pfizer and Moderna offered us made the COVID situation worse
0	They are injecting Alien DNA into us and are body’s wants to rejected and this is what u get ..
0	You CANNOT prevent ANY disease of any kind through injecting poison. PERIOD. THE END
1	Well you can always catch Covid 19 and have a far higher risk. Boosters are needed, it’s a small risk compared to what Covid can do to your body.
0	You tell me when I'm supposed to die from not getting any. I think this will be the second winter of severe illness and death. I'll let my own immune system protect me rather than being force fed new cures every season so big pharma can make a buck.
0	If it's so safe then why are manufacturers exempt from liability? Even washing machines come with a warranty…
1	My 7 year old son is penpals with his 93 year old great great uncle. Our uncle just wrote Z (my son) a letter saying that when he was my son’s age he had measles, mumps, chicken pox and scarlet fever all within a few months. He told Z that he was so grateful we had all these vaccines now so that Z didn’t have to go through that. It was a good reminder of how far we’ve come!
0	Worried about what we don't know about the vaccine.
0	This whole thing is fools errand that has no end… it’s obedience training
1	As a scientist, I get this question from friends and family ALL THE TIME. Thank you for putting my argument into a concise video I can just send everyone now lol
0	Am not used evil vaccine ..
0	Unjabbed and happy!!!
0	Stay away from the poison
0	Headache
0	Noticed the video failed to mention possible severe blood clotting, tinnitus, and anaphylactic shock that has occurred in some people.
1	Vaccines work, and are safe.
0	Freedom is worth dying for. My body my choice!
0	Biggest mistake of my life was taking the shot to get my wife out of lockdown. 2 years later and I still have heart problems and thrombosis in my legs. F the entire medical mafia.
0	The time will tell the truth about these vaccines.
1	We might have and probably have reached it and have you noticed that vaccinated people have shorter less bad colds and so are less likely to spread it because they have shorter colds and you're daughter's must be lucky and be born with strong immune systems and it is not about what happened to you for I am sure that there are many vaccinated children who that happened to but it is not about one person's experience it is about the whole and the average.
0	I NEVER took the jab. I was pressured by my own family, criticized, and bullied but i stood my ground. MY BODY MY CHOICE RIGHT?
0	Get ready for a lot of pain. That jab is no joke.
0	I’ll rely on my natural immunity thanks.
0	Doesn't grant 100 percent immunity, Not tested long enough before deployed to the public. Those are enough reasons for me
1	I wish this people could tell us, what we would need to tell their pre-illness self, that would have convinced them to get vaccinated. That could safe a lot of others.
0	I have never been vaxed and I have never had covid. All my friends who have been vaxed have had covid
1	They work by using mRNA, or messenger RNA, which is the molecule that essentially puts DNA instructions into action. Inside a cell, mRNA.
1	I’m glad I got it, never understood the resistance. Data is solid on it, mRNA has been in develop for ages.
0	People here believing what mainstream media tells them without requiring any evidence or proof. So a mainstream journalist outweighs the many scientists who have done proper research with verifiable results doesn't have the weight of a BA in journalism.... laughable
1	I vaccinated my baby against COVID. She ended up getting COVID two days before my appointment to get her vaccinated. Then she IMMEDIATELY got RSV/pneumonia. It was an absolutely miserable two months for her that set her back developmentally a bit. If vaccinating her even has a CHANCE of avoiding a similarly miserable life-or-death experience for her in the future, it’s 1,000% worth it.
0	so ur an anti-vaxxer?Hehe u should know that just because someone is vaccinated they dont have complete immunity they just have more immunity
0	Dear fellow purebloods. Stay strong
1	I feel we need to go from VOTE to VACCINE. Spread the word! So many people are not aware of how important this is.
0	God is our vaccine
1	Medical science is simply amazing. We went from not knowing if we could come up with a single vaccine to having 6. Absolutely incredible that we can hack the human body’s immune response to deal with otherwise deadly pathogens.
0	Do not give an untested vaccine to our most important people who knows what the side effects will be.
1	Being pro-vaccine doesn't mean ignoring potential risks or concerns. But it does mean recognizing that the benefits of vaccines greatly outweigh any rare complications
0	LMAO, he's had it 3 times because he's fully vaxxed and boosted. Every time you boost you make it harder and harder for your body to develop any kind of lasting immunity.
0	Feels like covid vaccines worked more effectively. Now it seems like they kinda sucks ngl
0	I am unvaccinated and don't have any regrets.
0	My mom lost her legs and I know 2 people who died within a week of the shot coincidence I'm sure
0	We also took way fewer precautions after getting vaccinated
0	I am remaining unvaxxed. At all cost that is important.
1	I've had all my vaccines. I've had Pfizer, Moderna and most recently I had Novavax. Do I need to get a second Novavax as a booster of that particular one?
0	had a heart attack after my jab. I'm young fit don't drink or smoke but that wasn't enough after my jab.
1	It pissed me off how nice docs were to anti vaxxers when they are so horrific to obese patients that are trying to be healthy but are held back by factors out of their control. Anti vaxxers are rabid dogs. They can't be argued with and they can easily end up killing those around them. I feel for their children and sad that our society is so broken people would rather believe their god daddy president and his mouthpieces bc they weren't taught basic science in school as it was "of the devil"
0	In my opinion I am very weary of RNA Vaccines. Remember the reason for RNA technology comes from producing more vaccines and cheaper, NOT because they are a better vaccine.
1	Don't be moronic, vaccinate against Omicron!
1	Tell them they can't have it, that it's only for the elites, and then they'll want it. It's the fact that it's being pushed as something you must do that stirs up suspicion. I think the vaccine will work just fine, I'm more concerned about the precedent that we set here and how we choose to approach non-participation.
0	~from the flu pandemics of 1918, 1956-58, and 1968. But when the media agendists move on to the next political hoax, just like the flu vaccine, only 43% of the population will bother getting the COVID-19 vaccine. This 'horror' and panic over COVID-19 is LESS horrible than the~
0	Still on the fence. I feel like it was rushed
0	It’s the vaccine lady. Stop just stop. Enough is enough.
0	I’m unvaccinated and I’m perfectly fine…my friends who got vaccinated are always getting sick .
1	I received my second dose today, and I'm excited to be fully vaccinated! Let's beat this virus together.
1	Two 70 somethings here hanging in with our vax dutifully. Now able to travel, visit families and friends without worrying about severe illness taking us out. We still use masks here and there, planes and doctors offices for instance.
0	I'd rather take my chances with the disease than the vaccine.
1	Just overheard someone saying they're hesitant about the vaccine. Shared my positive experience and the importance of protecting our community.
0	Thank god I've never had any covid vaccines!
1	A few months ago I said I'd never get the COVID vaccine. Tomorrow I get my second dose, and I just signed up as a volunteer to administer the vaccine. What changed?  I educated myself. Did research using actual medical sources, and talked to doctors I trust.
1	I'm grateful for the vaccine. It's our shield against COVID, just as MMR is against measles and mumps.
1	Thank you science
0	Vaccine or not u still got covid
0	If you have taken any of the vaccines for Covid Well, you were warned.
0	Took the vaccine, got headaches and soreness.
0	I wasn’t convinced to take a vaccine that hadn’t had long term studies done on it. When it became available and the government put pressure on us to get it I stood my ground as I don’t appreciate coercion
0	Please keep all of your records. Never can we let the bastards who forced these jabs on people, knowing they were not safe, nor the practitioners who did not care enough to advise their patients to avoid this injection, get away with saying “we didn’t know the harm they could cause”. We knew - they knew.
0	The second jab was way more crummy feeling than the first. I slept for two days with toilet and food intervals. Arm was sore to the touch and just felt like I got rough housed by an aggressive rottweiler. 😪 I was still recovering from a cold cough so I had mild chest pains (that I contacted my GP for). Never felt so violated in my life lol
0	Helloooooooo....ready to admit the Vax don't work?
0	How arrogant is this so called professor. Sits and grins right thru this interview.
0	When the vax first came out I was telling people that it would destroy their immune system and they argued with me saying I didn't know what I was talking about but I'm sure most people who took the vax are privately regretting it now.
1	Grateful to be vaccinated
1	Truth! I'm immunocompromised (Crohn's, so I love this channel) and was paranoid about COVID until I was able to get the vaccines last spring. I got my booster the first day of September and earlier this week my roommate got COVID from her boyfriend. We were briefly in the same room with each other before she started getting really symptomatic and tested, but while she's positive and sick I tested negative and have been fine. A few weeks prior I also got two potential exposures within two days, but those people were masked. I honestly feel that without the vaccines I would not have been able to stay away from COVID this year since all classes are back to full capacity with only masks separating us.
1	Vaccinated today. It's more than health; it's about getting our lives back on track.
0	I don't see evidence they are hiding anything--the CDC talks about the serious side effects that happened during the trials and always asks that people report anything unusual so they can learn more about the vaccine. You have to remember that people with autoimmune disorders would have been excluded from the initial trials (they always test on healthy adults, not compromised adults--I've worked in the research department of a big pharm company, so I know), so no evidence about how people with autoimmune disorders react would initially have been available; in addition, all the official advice about taking the vaccine if you have an autoimmune disorder clearly states that although the CDC recommends it because it can prevent death and hospitalization, the long term effects on those with autoimmune disorders is currently unknown. That seems pretty up front and transparent to me--no hiding anything, they just don't know yet. So you can blame them for a "too early rollout," I guess, but not on hiding the effects on those with compromised immune systems. They've admitted all along, they just do not know. They need more data, and the people on this forum can supply it by reporting their side effects to the CDC. But I also understand the pressure to get a life saving vaccine on the market--too many people were dying. The vaccine has clearly saved some lives.   I have had covid twice and have an autoimmune disorder (gluten ataxia). I am also a covid long hauler. I can tell you that the side effects of the vaccine people are reporting on this forum mimic some of the side effects of being a covid long hauler. I can also report that the long hauler symptoms I experienced were controlled, at least in my case, with zinc (some people report better results with a zinc/Vit c combo, but for me, zinc alone really helped with the long hauler symptoms). That's not a guarantee zinc or Vit C will work for everyone, but for many, they have provided relief.  A high proportion of covid long haulers have autoimmune disorders, so it makes sense that the vaccine would be more problematic for people with an autoimmune disease. However, personally, I'll take problematic side effects, even those that last for months, over dying or serious hospitalization. However, I would urge everyone to report their vaccine side effects to the CDC so they can collect them and make better recommendations for those with compromised immune systems. That way, with a better knowledge base, more people can weigh the risks for themselves and make a more informed decision about taking the vaccine. But it's important not to forget the risk if you don't take it--death or severe disability from extended hospitalization. That's a game of Russian Roulette I'm not willing to play.
1	im watching this bc i got moderna and it feels like my arms been punched from the inside
1	Hopefully start on January 1st this vaccine would be approved and make 2021 the best year ever
1	The vacine production needs to increase, its a race againt the clock.
0	You now have the MRNA within you to enable manipulation of your body. This will most likely leave you vulnerable to other diseases.  They will top you up regularly with the new version yearly or more often, as you will become dependent on it to live in the new covid normal. It’s a crime against humanity!
0	My then 15 year old son started having severe headaches 9 days after the second dose. It took 10 days to discover he had a blood clot in his frontal lobe and an abscess above it. He had bacterial meningitis. Was in hospital over 3 weeks and had 2 brain surgeries including a craniotomy.
1	I got my booster and flu shot together and I was totally fine! I didn’t have any side effects at all.
1	I got COVID. I did have to be in the hospital, but I know beyond a shadow of a doubt that my being vaccinated saved my life.
0	We don't want our DNA to be tempered with.
1	I suppose no regrets. Wife worked in pharmaceutical at the time. I honestly don't even know if I ever had covid. If I did, it wasn't even bad enough for me to have thought I had it, therefore never even bothered testing for it. Only ever tested for it twice, when both my kids tested positive for it. But I never tested positive myself.
1	The recommended vaccine schedule has been developed so your child will have the best response to develop immunity. If you’ve fallen behind on your child’s vaccines, it’s not too late to get caught up!
1	Excited to have received the first part of my #PfizerBioNTech #CovidVaccine today.Impressive resource mobilization
0	No trust in vaccines, especially with the rushed development.
1	We know the rich will get immediate access to the vaccine but I sure hope our front line workers in all industries will have that chance too.
0	wouldn't get it. It would still be an untested unproven injection.
0	I was one of those people who did not trust or plan to get the shot , but after about a year and a half , i decided to get the shot because my job put me at great risk of catching Covid , but I wish i stood my ground, and never taken it; won't be taking anymore ! My blood pressure went up after the shot , and I've been on a blood pressure so called medication that also has terrible side effects
0	Don`t take the poison.
0	I’m unvaccinated and will continue to thoroughly research and remain unvaccinated.
0	I'm glad I trust my gut feeling, the pharma industry is absolutely evil. I have companies still denying me just because I'm unvaccinated, its crazy
0	A soft leftist I know heard this from me. I said “my friend, you now support Pfizer, mandatory vaccines, and Government lockdowns….?” He just looked at me and shock his head as if he didn’t understand is own understandings. I couldn’t believe the left was doing this, but the powerful comforted and protected them with the blanket of virtue. Just like any good villain, cover your intentions with good deeds.
1	I was vaccinated and have had a great life. I still get a flu shot every year, and an updated Covid vaccination. I made sure all my kids were vaccinated and they are vaccinating their own children! Vaccines have saved so many lives and prevented so much suffering! None of us have had any bad reactions to vaccines. Just as this investigation pointed out, you have a much higher chance of suffering debilitating injury from the disease than you do a side effect from the vaccine!
0	vaccine?? wtf do we need a vaccine for?? The annual flu is more deadly.
0	Dear Anti Vax people, y'all are dumb
0	oh hey, if we're doing Anti vaxx why not bring back communism along measles while we're at it?
1	It's reduces risk of transmission It reduces risk of serious illness It reduces risk of death.
1	Vaccines are our shield against illnesses like COVID-19. Protect yourself and others by getting vaccinated at our pharmacy! Contact us today to schedule your vaccination appointment. Together, let's build a healthier, safer community!
0	Brother, friend, and I all got our second round of #Moderna today. 12 hours later, brother has a migraine, friend has a migraine + chills, and my entire body aches. Gonna be a long night
0	It used to be you were told "dont give in to peer pressure and experiment with drugs". Now they say "listen to your peers, take the experimental drugs". I dont want anything that teaches my body to attack it's own cells. I will remain in the control group
1	Well, after receiving the 2nd shot I had a sort of mild fever and headache. The experience was worse than that of the 1st shot. I couldn't sleep. Also had injection site pain which isn't a big deal cuz it's a very common and natural side effect. However, I am doing well now and I am fine. 😃
0	Never had one, never will.
1	I have had both vaccines thank you to the scientists
0	95% effective, on a virus that is 96.9% survivable??? Makes no sense
1	it is unfortunate how people down play getting the vaccine
1	3) obviously medicine has gotten better since then &; now we churn out a new flu vaccine every year to account for its mutation rate, but we still have to figure out COVID-19 &; mass panic doesnt help. Misinformation &; careless mistakes can severely affect a groups vulnerability

0	Great video!  Great  information!  3.5 years LC + vax injury.  This is stuff I had not heard before.
0	I’m not taking it.
0	i dont know one person that wants to take this shot.
1	If you don’t want it don’t get it. It’ll make the line shorter for when I go
0	This documentary sickened me to my core. And further convinced me that I would never take it. Well done to Nazarin for standing up for herself.
0	By not taking the jab, I'm 100% safe from side effects and 99% safe from covid.
0	"The vaccines aren't appropriate for use in humans." Florida's surgeon general, Dr. Joseph Ladapo, calls for an immediate halt to mRNA-based Covid "vaccines", citing cancer and other health risks. "Dr. Ladapo says he has safety concerns pertaining to the discovery of billions of DNA fragments found per dose in the Pfizer and Moderna Covid vaccines."
0	Atleast 5 people in my circle of known people have died following second dose of covid Vaccine..... It's true most people are ok with the Vaccine.... But for those who are allergic it's deadly
0	the sideeffects seems to much to me
1	My Husband and I, Both 68, took both vaccines and had no problem at all... I even helped on Valentine's Day at my daughter's flower shop. I had to get the second vaccine then.... I went right back to work and I never was sore or tired....
1	Had both shots AZ here in Australia. First dose I had light fever and headache but went away the next day. Second shot was fine,
0	Yeah I won’t be getting the vaccine
0	the first covid vaccine I got gave me heart palpitations, no thanks.
1	Let’s do this country great people, get your vaccine, wear a mask, use hand sanitizer, stay away from big crowds for now , what is so fucking hard about that , people in this country need to get it together.
1	I am a firm believer in vaccinations. That being said, I'm in my 30s and each and every of the 4 covid shots I've had so far were quite brutal. Each time I was sicker than I've ever been. Fast forward into end of 2022, I finally caught the real covid (kids brought it home from school). Just as brutal as the shot, maybe a tad worse. I was fine 2 days later. So, I get it that some people don't want to get vaccinated. But I like to think that, had I not had the vaccine and gotten covid earlier in the pandemic, I probably would have not survived. Yay to science! And yes, I get the flu shot every year.
1	Nope, my parents didn't because my brother almost died directly after getting vaccinated
0	The fact is you can’t ACTUALLY count the lives that have been saved.  You can’t just can’t know that. It’s a bullshit sales pitch.
1	Antivaxxers are fucking retards
0	As a nurse 10 years in the NHS,  I'm so glad I did my resurch and refused the vaccine! That dr who said on main streem media prob saved my life by saying the sicence don't back the mandate!!!
0	A lot of what doctors thought about these new mRNA vaccines is now known to be false
0	When a person/government is forcing you to do something , you don't have to research or prove anything, you have to refuse it by default because they want to hurt you.
0	I had a heart attack from vacinne.
1	Fully vaccinated and urging others to follow suit.
0	Who pays for these ridiculous studies?
0	Those shots shouldn't be given to anyone, ever!!!
1	Imagine spending years studying the delicate craft of vaccines and then some Karen spends 5 minutes on bing and thinks she’s smarter than you
0	I wasn't antivax but I am now . I will never trust the pharmaceutical or medical profession ever again . Statins , antidepressants it's just about money , it always has been .
0	Is not a virus is a venom if anybody is interested there’s a detailed documentary explaining with evidence
0	This is absolutely evil to force citizens to take mandatory jabs for keeping their jobs. There are many many news about sudden death of healty people after the jabs. This is still happening....
1	"long term side effects" is a tricky question to ask on anything. We don't know this on 1G mobile phones or our microwaves. A simple trick is, if there are not any or many short term effects, you can safely bet the long term will be even less problematic then those. I've yet to hear a vaccine issue that didn't show anything within weeks and suddenly very dangerous months later.
1	Remember it's not just the deaths, it's the potentially worse outcomes of the disease. It's the permanent damage that covid could cause to bodies which is also significantly lowered by the vaccine.
0	Stop it. Just stop it.
0	These poor ignorant, deceived people don't deserve to die. Your political views should not result in the death penalty. I blame their evil LEADERSHIP....
1	Look, guys! I’m just like Travis Kelce, two bandaids! Except #Broncos hat and not an NFL tight end. #Getvaccinated #flu #covid #vaxxed #mrpfizer
1	I almost die with all my family on November 2019 due COVID and we are trying to get the vaccines
1	Im happy that me and my family survived covid! thanks to the vaccine
0	Someone still falling for the covid vaccines lol?
1	Summer 2021 is going to be a good one once we get everyone fully vaccinated. What was your experience getting the COVID vaccine?
1	Vaccines are safe
1	Big pharma Guinea pig here! Day 5 of being vaccinated and i feel great, only had a minor headache the day after for a bit. Happy to be doing my part to help us get over this.
0	The fear is not if vaccines do well or not, but what are its consecuencies in the future for our bodies or other variants of Covid-19 (Sars-Cov-2)
0	I am an athlete. I got my second dose of the covid vaccine 3 days ago. The next day after the vaccine, I couldn't sleep. I had the worst fever ever. Today is my 3rd day after the second shot, I feel normal but my stamina when I workout is not the same. I feel like I get fatigued much faster than before and I run out of breath much faster than I used to. I swear I am not lying.
1	Getting my second dose tomorrow
1	Scientists have been researching this for over 20 years so it’s nothing they just dreamed up quickly.
0	I was infected by my work partner who took the jab the week before and I almost lost my life. Two other people in my group were infected that same time by the same person. Please explain that to me.
0	Why do we get the vaccine that even the government does not use it for its own people? We are not experimental subjects.
1	I got both doses and both me and baby were fine shes healthy and nothing abnormal or wrong with her. 100% healthy and happy baby girl, who is 9 weeks old today  Love your channel!
1	Get vaxed. Being against vaccine is being #ProCovid.
1	I don't mind the flu shot, i have no bad side effects, but won't be getting the clot shot.
0	I did not get the vaccine shot. I’m so glad I listened to my instincts and not the doctors trying to force me to take it.
1	Judy got her #JohnsonAndJohnsonVaccine shot on Monday and I just had dose #1 of the #Moderna. Let's hug!
0	My mom lay in the hospital with Covid pneumonia after the 4th jab, and in heart failure after receiving them.
1	Tested positive for Covid in May. over 65, obese, High Blood pressure. Got Vaxed early, last booster in April, fatigued, Dry cough, no fever, felt crappy for 6 days, Got a prescription for Plaxovid the day after I tested positive. Fully recovered in about 10 days' I would say that the Vaccine kept me from getting very sick....Glad I got it, especially after hearing about all the antivaxxers who have died with their "Natural immunity". YMMV, but in my opnion the Vaccine was a godsend.
1	How haven’t I caught covid with a Janssen vaccination & working in childcare!? Am I that unwantable
1	Had my anti-vaxx coworker say to me "you should read what's in vaccines." I have and still am 100% okay with them.
0	Same. I don’t regret NOT taking the COVID vaccine. I knew it was faked from the beginning. Lots of us did.
1	I served 25 years in the military. I took shots every year and lost count. As a kid my brothers and sisters and I walked up to the health center to take Polio, measles and other shots.
0	Vaccines ruin your body immune system.  Military personnel and veterans have had enough Vaccines
0	How about take your frickin supplements to boost your immune system. There is so much info out there. Look for it. Quit depending on the government for your info.
1	Do you remember before vaccines how hospital deaths were overflowing mortuaries and bodies were being stored in cooler vans in hospital parking lots? That’s what COVID unmitigated by vaccination looks like. Your immunity wanes over time, and new variants reduce older vaccination effectiveness. Just get vaccinated.
1	I think doctors should have the "right to refuse treatment" to those who inspite of having access to vaccine, didn't take it. After all, that should also be an "individual choice". They should have the "freedom to choose, who they want to treat".That will help free up medical resources.
0	The whole vaccine topic has become too political for me. It's hard to know what's true when everything feels like an agenda.
0	Imagine a product so awful that you have to lobby for tyrannical laws just so ppl will buy it.
1	Thankful to have received the vaccine. It's a big relief!
0	The longer this has gone on, the more relieved I am that I never got the jab.
0	was on the same boat as you, unfortunately had to take it to work. I now developed a constant fear of passing out from  a heart attack or cardiac arrest. I am scared to even workout
0	There was no test.... they knew what the jabs would do when they released them.
1	Why was the anti-vaxxer’s 2 year old child crying? Midlife crisis
0	If the vaccine will result in malformed births for the next generations. I am pretty sure it will be. (There are tons of examples for the malformed births in Africa and India because of the mRNA vaccines). In order to avoid its damages, the unvaccinated generation should not marry with the vaccinated generation. You can’t see the extent of its damages.
1	Science is amazing. We’ve come a long way.
0	My niece was a care giver for several years. In order for her to keep her job, she was required to take the poison. She is now full of cancer. Not saying the poison caused the cancer, but she was in perfect health before the required shots of poison.
0	So thankful my family didn't fall for the jab.  Even my daughter with cancer, her Dr told her no vaccine
1	The reason it logically makes sense to accept the risks is that it is far less risky to get the vaccine than to get covid.
0	My doctor asked me to get the jab and I told him that I’ve managed for 70 years without any problems so I won’t participate in their experimental jabs. But instead I will build up my immune system with vitamins D3 zinc,magnesium and c. All blessings from Ireland
0	Kudos to all of you who didn't cave to the pressure and refused the jab. You're my people.
0	Ten years from now we'll see commercials saying "if you took the Pfizer covid vaccine between the years 2020-2021 you may be entitled for compensation"
0	My husband was forced to take the shots to keep his heart Dr. appt at VA Hospital. After his first shot, I came home to find him passed out on the floor. It took about 30 minutes to get him to come out of it. He has incessant headaches, and dizzy spells. 1 year later VA runs MRI and then MRE on his hear. VA says his brain vessels are full of small clots. And he is never feeling well anymore. VA has it on his record that it is a side effect from shots. My doctor told me what was in it and would not take it. I did not either. At least I am here to take care of my husband.
1	"Getting vaccinated is not just about personal safety; it's a contribution to the collective well-being."
0	So briefly, what can one do if they have already taken the poison injections?
1	Anti-vax arguments just don't hold up. The benefits of vaccination far outweigh the risks
1	I AM NOT ANTIVAXX!
1	The side effects she experienced are the same as if you got a flu shot!!! People covid is way worse!!!
1	Just be careful if you are not planning on getting the vaccine. I am 75 and sure didn't want to take the chance of getting covid so I did get the vaccine and I am so glad that I did
1	Trust the vaccines
1	I intend to get it. The only reason I would not is if baby has an adverse reaction to an earlier vaccine or if they’re not robust enough to handle the vaccine (eg have cardiovascular issues). In either case I’d have a discussion with the pediatrician and try to chart a path towards getting protection at a later time.  I have immunocompromised family members so it’s important my baby isn’t a disease vector - regardless of their personal risk of illness. We also don’t know what - if any - long term impacts exist for COVID in infants and I’m not cool with running my own personal clinical trial to find out with my baby. I feel more comfortable with the relatively known risks of the vaccine over the unknown risks of the disease.
1	Thanks to vaccines, we've seen a significant reduction in the prevalence of once-devastating diseases like polio and measles
0	Untested on animals, data hidden for years, ingredients undisclosed. What could go wrong?
1	Being anti vax is already stupid enough but to deny covid even exists?! That’s a level of stupidity that would drive Ren more crazy than Stimpy already does!
1	Yes vaccines do works … unlike the brains of the anti vaxer cultists, which do not!
1	I had a pretty serious abdominal reaction this time… one horrible night of excruciating pain… one of my previous 5 COVID shots did the same. It is a pretty well documented issue. Won’t stop me from getting the shot again.
1	I was finally able to get my first shot, had to be in the ER last Sunday for other reasons and they said would you like the vaccination and because of worries about my allergies I figured if I had a reaction where better to be but in the MGH ER! I have to get the second in about three weeks now and they said they would do it there. I had no side effects except my arm the next day felt like I was hit with a 2x4 that subsided in a day or so. Been fine ever since.
1	My wife is a nurse here in Jacksonville, FL. She has been killing herself the last few weeks at work and now is in bed sick ( as are several nurses). She is vaccinated and should be fine but this isn’t right. Get your darn vaccine people!!!
1	"I trust the scientific process and the extensive testing the vaccines underwent before approval."
0	THANK GOD I DID NOT GET THE VACCINE
0	In my town the vaccinated people are all getting it again and the non vaccinated are not getting it. These people are nuts, no long term effects have been tested. What a bunch of nut jobs
0	I risked to remain semi paralyzed after the first shot of Pfizer. After 6 weeks still I'm limping, although I was a healthy man before the vaccine. Does mRNA messes up with the nervous system? yes it does.
1	Team vaccine here!
0	I'm not taking any of that crap
1	Scientists have been working on the corona virus for quite some years, and due to a record amount of collaborations and funding, they were able to come up with a vaccine quicker.

1	I love how everyone is so fixated on the long term effects of the vaccine, when they don't even consider the long term effects of being infected with covid.
0	I question the motives behind pushing mass vaccination campaigns.

0	I had Covid June 2021. Had both my Pfeizer vaccines. But I'm batteling with terrible muscle aches and headaches. I was told by my GP it could take 5 month's to a year to go away. In the meantime from drinking anti inflammatories for pain it damaged my kidneys. Now I suffer daily from terrible pain.  Any advise what to do.
1	make covid hit you like a light cold, or get the virus, and you will get the virus, and have a terrible week with a small but still relevant chance of dying.
0	Don't care... you can stick that wherever you wish, respectfully. Nothing is encouraging enough to risk my Life so bill gates can make money. Not happening.

1	There have been 78 study's and counting proving vaccines do not cause autism. And also there have been many studies showing that vaccines are completely safe
1	yes please
0	The reality is that the vaccine didn’t help very much. They gave us false promises from the beginning, for example they said the vaccine protects you from infection -> proven to be wrong.
1	Do you really think all the governments around the world are lying about the seriousness of COVID, and about vaccine safety & efficacy?
1	i'm more than excited to get vaccinated! and because of this video, i'm more than determined to share this towards my family and friends. kudos to the team behind this video!
1	I miss the days when a vaccine was considered a miracle.
0	I know so many people (all of whom are fully jabbed) who have got a constant cough or headaches or are feeling generally unwell.
0	At this point, I've lost all trust in the "experts". Even if every jab was a "kill shot", they'd still be chanting 'safe and effective'...
1	the vaccine kept me out of the hospital when i had covid
0	How much are they paying you to promote the covid vaccine?
1	Got my shot and ready to boost our collective immunity
0	This is a good point. I am all for science and protecting yourself against disease, but I also believed heavily that I could count on my Covid vaccines along with being outside and around people to be the most effective way to build my immune system up. So far, I’ve been 100%.
1	my grandma got her vaccine and she's been doing great, if it's safe for her, it's safe for me
1	Currently waiting my turn for the vaccine
0	When I got the first 2 doses of the pzifer vaccine, I had minor aches and pains, headache, and chills which went away within a few hours of getting the vaccine. However when I got the pzifer booster and flu shot, I was miserable, all of those side effects were so strong. Aches and pains, and headache was horrible and lasted for a couple of days for me. Never want to go through that again. Was horrible.
1	Until we have a better understanding of the neurological risks from long Covid, I’ll keep getting boosters.
0	It's just a Soros conspiracy. True magas don't take any vaccines.
0	I would never let anyone in my family get this vaccine, more research is needed
0	I'm still unvaccinated and I'm one of the very few people around me (Vaccinated friends and family members) to not have any health problems. My coworkers are constantly sick as well.
0	listen lol once again vaccinated people are catching spreading and dying from the vaccine ....... and if it works so well masks wouldn't be recommended for the vaccinated lol .... let me guess your pumped about taking a booster shot evert month ???
0	I don't like how politicized the vaccine discussion has become.
1	Vaccines undergo rigorous testing to ensure they are safe and effective.
1	The "horror stories" are antivaxxer propaganda. The only reason he'd have to worry is if he has an extremely frail immune system, like compromised by a disease frail. He'll be fine.  The pros are that his immunity to COVID will be increased >90% and he'll get that nice job.  The cons are a chance of flu-like symptoms for about 12 hours and a bruise on the arm that will go away after a day if he ices it.  I've gotten Moderna four times now. No issues whatsoever.
0	Cringe. Money grabbing fluid they just think we would take without any hestiation. Deadlier than working on a boat
0	As a nurse, I witnessed my coworkers have significant adverse effects and then be met with stone silence by the medical establishment. That was enough to make me not want to take it.
0	Niece had brain bleeding right after the shot and still is in long term care after suffering a stroke.
0	"Natural remedies and a healthy lifestyle are sufficient; I don't need a vaccine."
0	Didn’t gates say his kids wouldn’t be taking this? So why should I?
1	I have an immune disorder and even though I couldn't get vaccinations I made sure that my child did. I weighed the pros and cons and decided it was worth the risk. As my daughter reached highschool   I let her decide for herself.
0	Anyone who took the shoot WILL regret it.
1	I have gotten all vaccinations as soon as they were available.   My son and his wife has had it but they did not come near me while they were positive.
1	Man, those long term effects really make me paranoid. We haven’t even seen them yet from any vaccine, but they exist guys, trust me, I have watched hours of biased videos and have tons on anecdotal evidence.
1	I feel lucky to be in a group eligible for the vaccine before the general population. The reward greatly outshines the risk.
1	Pfizer jabbed during pregnancy and jabbed while breastfeeding. No side effects for myself or my newborn. We are all healthy.
1	My son is 9 months old, I really worry about him.
0	Kudos to all the uninjected!
1	It's sad to see America ordered 200% vaccines to population but only 50% are vaccinated. Most of the vaccines went expitrd and people in my country are literly fighting to get mRNA vaccines.
0	Do you think they've been exaggerating those #flu death stats, maybe to sell vaccines/justify budgets? (crying wolf) Flu might kill people who are already on death's door. The elderly/vulnerable who die of #coronavirus might still have years or decades left to live. #covid19
0	talk about what happened when you tested it on Animals.
1	It’s vaccines. They were tested.
1	Vaccination is the most selfless act you can do right now. Protect others
0	Smart man! I’m not getting that shot either!
1	I was hesitant before, but after my family convinced me to take the first shot I felt pretty good.
1	Get vaccinated people!
1	I am happy that I live in Denmark where approximately 90% of adults are vaccinated, and we are back to our normal lifes! No restrictions anymore! 😄
0	You should ask your parents to do a bit more research and maybe they will change their mind. Ask different doctors for opinions, not just one. And certainly don't listen to people on social media. Your are just 12.. why would they let you take it for gods sake
1	Being antivaxx is absolutely NOT something "it can't hurt to try." We recommend vaccines because it hurts public health not to do so.
0	well lucky for you. My mother had blood clots in her spleen, heart and lungs and.almost died from that damn shot!
1	The best vaccine is the one you are offered.......Thank you for explaining in simple terms.
0	THANK YOU Florida Surgeon General
0	This causal determination of potentially lethal vaccine outcomes should be world-wide news! Thanks Dr.Campbell, you are THE MAN!
0	Biggest mistake of my life was taking the shot to get my wife out of lockdown. 2 years later and I still have heart problems and thrombosis in my legs. F the entire medical mafia.
1	I didn't have any bad side effects from the Pfizer vaccine, just a tired or fatigued feeling
0	I ddcline the vaccine
1	To those doubting the vaccine, my arm might be a little sore, but it's nothing compared to the potential consequences of not getting vaccinated
1	As a Norwegian im gonna nominate you for a Nobel price. You made me take the vaccine and it probably saved my life. Thank you sir
1	I just got my second shot this morning at this vaccination centre and just wanted to thank the highly efficient staff! Everyone was  very helpful and kind contributing to a seamless, pleasant experience! Well done!
1	The safest and responsible approach to tackle this pandemic is to wear mask, maintain social distance, avoid crowds, keep good hygiene, regularly exercise, eat healthy, drink lots of water, sleep well, supplement your body with D3/C/Zinc….and GET VACCINATED.
1	Where I live I was eligible in late December.  Had to wait a few days because I had gotten the flu shot recently.  Life has been gradually returning to normal since March, live music and restaurants are open, and last week we were allowed to take off our
0	After my second Pfizer shot I had. 105.2 fever and convulsions… then pneumonia for 2 weeks… the doctors wanted me to keep my mouth shut and not blame the shot I received
1	"I got vaccinated to protect my family and friends. It's a small sacrifice for the greater good. #TeamVaccine"
1	I feel terrible for these people but my compassion and patience for the unvaccinated is really wearing thin.
1	Just get the damn vaccine people it’s just simple
1	Getting vaccinated is a tribute to the incredible scientists and doctors who've worked tirelessly. I'm so grateful.
0	The risk of any medical intervention should always be voluntary.  Never should we mandate anything like this.
1	It's gratifying to hear her call anti-vaxxers a cult.
1	Never had Covid, vaxxed to the hilt, wear a mask when in close contact with others. Maybe I just have a really good immune system. I consider myself fortunate. I don’t like being sick, and I damn sure don’t want any long Covid symptoms. I’m so grateful for the vaccine
1	I laughed so hard when you impersonated the anti-vaxxers. It's so true!
1	I’d rather take my chances with a vaccine instead of being one of the 635,000 people dead from it.
1	The Unvaccinated with their cold hard facts from Social Media are upon us!
1	I don't understand what is the anti mRNA vaccines logic. You are against mRNA for some reason? Fine, then take something else that is not Moderna or Pfizer. What the heck if you are really into conspiracies then just get the good old inactive virus vaccine that exists for decades. There is simply no reason not to get vacinatted.
0	The amount of relief I feel that I didn't get vaccinated, even though I was pressured by almost every member of my family, is absolutely indescribable! I feel sorry for those who got it though. Best of luck, they're definitely gonna need it.
0	It was not a vaccine and whatever it is, it didn’t work and Big Pharma bought off Congress so it can’t be sued.
0	How many of the 'safe' vaccines did the King get?
0	Thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS, very rare, primarily associated with the Johnson & Johnson vaccine)
0	I know it’s the holidays but I think the Nova Scotia government should be able to gather the vaccination status of the 25 people in hospital suffering from COVID-19. Saying you’ll have the information next week when you haven’t provided it for over a week now isn’t good enough.
1	I’ve got every single shot, and I ended up with covid. It was a sore throat and nothing more.It’s amazing how much the vaccines drop the effects.
0	One ring to bind them...
1	Just a little PSA seeing as the government hasn’t really told anyone here but every single adult in Chicago is eligible for their covid booster. Go get your triple. Triples are best. Triples make it safe
1	All shots and boosters. No covid. And I’m getting 5G reception better than ever.
1	Sweet, I'm hoping I can get vaccinated soon too
1	Y’all. I went to Disney World in Florida at the beginning of June 2021. It’s now the end of June 2021. I am vaccinated, I was not required to wear a mask, and I STILL DON’T HAVE COVID. That vaccine works.
0	I am unvaccinated and don't have any regrets.
1	i hope there would be a vaccine for kids and youngsters thats as effective and as safe as the one's the mature ones gets..
0	we getting injected with a foreign vaccine?
1	Vaccines! Do they work? So far the answer is yes. Are they effective? It appears they are for vulnerable age groups. The question is will this last with the new Omicron variant?
1	I got the shot , and I feel terrible. I have no complaints. The side effects let me know that it’s working. COVID won’t send me to the hospital.
0	They are dangerous for all ages.
0	"We have all seen how effective they have been....right!"
1	Tomorrow it's my turn to be jabbed. #Vaccination #ChemburGymkhana
0	I've read studies questioning the effectiveness of these vaccines against certain variants.
0	Had two doses of az. In UK. Coerced by education employer. Never been right since. Arthritis/ fatigue/ brain fog. Been made to feel like a heretic regularly even by close family. Thank you so much for highlighting this, hopefully it will save some from suffering.
0	is it not weird all the "free stuff" people are getting for the vaxx lmaooo
1	Today I finally got my first dose of the #COVID19Vaccine . I never thought I was going to be this happy to have my poked . I hope you all can get your #vaccine soon! #Moderna #vaccinated
1	I got vaccinated to support the healthcare workers who have been tirelessly fighting the pandemic. By getting vaccinated, I'm helping to reduce the burden on our healthcare system.
0	New here. Been permanently banned from multiple COVID sites for presenting meta analysis on ivermectin
1	That's literally the liberal playbook. Lie blame spread misery. Take another #COVID19 vaccine please
0	Just don't force me to take them and I am happy.
0	Moderna is upset with Megyn Kelly for publicly disclosing her vaccine injuries caused by her covid booster, her 3rd shot. Moderna worries that Megyn Kelky discussing her autoimmune disorder (triggered by the covid vaccine) would add to the public fear of autoimmune disorders triggered by the vaccine Only big pharma has the unmitigated gall to attack victims disclosing injuries caused by their own products
0	My uncle had a heart attack 1 week after getting the Pfizer vaccine, lucky he survived, but is in constant pain. My aunt also started having uncontrollable shaking and tremors
0	Fuck vaxxers
0	I regret getting it. I had covid and in my case it was 1 day of mild fever and 1 week of coughing while my second booster fucked me up for 2 days and nights and made me feel way worse than actual disease.
0	Ivermectin is my vaccine. I had 2 Covid vaccines and was in ICU for 10 days with Covid and my 39 yr old nephew died. Keep taking that fake 💩
1	To everyone questioning the vaccine: it's not just about you. It's about protecting those who are vulnerable in our community.
0	I won't let fear dictate my health decisions; I choose not to get vaccinated.
1	I got the vaccine to protect my friends, family, and community. We're all in this together.
0	I am sorry that you took the shot. Just do a little research, and you'll see. It's designed to kill 3,4 years out.
0	The lack of long-term studies on the vaccines makes me hesitant to get vaccinated.
0	Never tested. Never vaxed. Perfectly healthy. Not afraid.
0	Im not an anti-vaxxer, but the COVID vaccine is different. Its too new to be fully trusted. #SafetyFirst
1	Question is Covid and their answer is Vaccination
0	I'm just waiting to see more long-term data before making a decision. It feels like we're still learning about the vaccine's effectiveness.
1	This Vaccine save lives; fear endangers them. It's a simple message parents need to keep hearing.
1	By giving people small doses of covid from the vaccine, we will develop better immune system. It has been proven years ago
1	Good can someone mass produce this product and get it to the arm of everyone who wants it?
0	For me personally, I'm terrified of needles. I get panic attacks every time I get my blood drawn. One of the YouTubers I watch said she got the shot and immediately passed out from it. And she got the second shot and she is in a lot of pain. I don't feel like it's safe to use.
0	RIP IM NOT DOING IT
1	Don’t care why, give me that boost.
1	Get the vaccine if you can!
0	I'm not against vaccines, but I am cautious about new one
1	Got my second dose yesterday. I feel crummy, but covid would be worse. Very grateful to be in a country where this is possible.
1	I got the covid vaccine. I feel great. I trust science.
1	As an actual oncologist, probably also good to point out that nothing could possibly cause "turbo cancer" because the term is entirely made up by idiots, and is nonsensical.
0	Vaccine development is rushed, and there are worries about potential unknown risks associated with new vaccines.
1	Smart people get vaccinated.
0	My mom got auto immune condition after vaccine of two doses. Our life has become hell.
1	i am pro taking the vaccine
0	Never have, never will!'
1	Yes! Inject that into my veins muscle tissue!
0	The day my employer requires this is the day my skills go elsewhere.
0	The point could be valid, but the analogy is inapposite with the the fact that many genetic deletions are associated with autism and are inheritable; autism is not an injury caused by vaccination. Fact checking with reliable sources isn't in an antivaxxers wheelhouse. Or, this is an ESL issue.  Edit: polititans[sic] in the post above has since been corrected. There is still an issue with the second sentence's clarity.  Mind =/= blown.
1	I got the booster yesterday and feel great! No side effects!
0	I was forced to get my vaccines by my mum because I was under 18. I never wanted ir, because I knew it was a terrible idea, and I'm blessed to of had zero effects, but seeing what's happened to others, I am terrified now. I wish I was like you all who never touched it.
1	Got my first Pfizer jab about 22 hours ago. Feeling great, no side effects except for a slightly sore arm. Apparently the second vaccine hits harder though with chills fever and fatigue (which is a normal reaction after getting vaccinated).
1	Just had my second shot of Pfizer, taking a day off to let me get over the muscle aches and the headaches, there not bad just annoying, already mainly gone. Glad that so many people are able to get it!
0	I’ve been ok without it . Don’t want it . This vaccine should be a choice
1	Some people Take such things in a positive way. That if i take this vaccine i may be able to conclude the Virus and Save millions
1	Sick fucks. You don't want the vaccine? Fine. Don't fucking stop my mom from getting it. I hope they catch COVID.
0	From 712 to well over 6 almost 7000 adverse reactions!! THAT IS NOT NORMAL
0	Remember when people were forced to take it to keep their jobs while the CDC told us it undoubtedly blocked you from getting COVID?  Almost like they mighta lied or something
1	We should get vaccinated for our communities well being
1	Love this. Sounds a whole lot better than covid! Thank you for sharing with everyone
0	Big pharma don't create cures
0	We have to stand up for this world wide tyranny.
0	No thank you. I survived the Delta variant unvaxxed. My immunity is stronger now. I was in the hospital next to vaccinated people that were dying literally next to me.
1	I got my vaccine and I feel healthy
1	Bro go get vaccinated. I'm tired of all these Covid variants
1	1st dose!!! Yahooo! Update: second dose!!
0	I still think natural immunity is better. I mean, if you've had COVID, you should be good, right?
0	Little MONEY was spent on prevention; billions are being spent on developing vaccines.
1	I got the 3 shots and I didn't get sick any time. I'm from Brazil. Here the vaccination was slow at the beginning, but now we are almost finishing!
0	This documentary sickened me to my core. And further convinced me that I would never take it. Well done to Nazarin for standing up for herself.
0	Unvaccinated. Never took part in this pantomime as history has taught me not too. Still alive and well
0	The only real evidence you provided was for the reported case. And it was literally called the first ever. You provide no evidence or links to support the rest of you claims. No studies, no research, and no data. You are making claims but no backing them up.  Here is some data about cases of disease before and after the vaccines were created   https://ivaccinate.org/about-vaccines/vaccines-are-effective/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=ivaccinate  Another  http://www.immunizeforgood.com/fact-or-fiction/benefits-vs.-risks  Risks of not vaccinating  https://www.caringforkids.cps.ca/handouts/when-parents-choose-not-to-vaccinate-risks-and-responsibilities  The reason vaccines have risks is because a) the person may have an undiagnosed immune disorder. Which means they can't take vaccines because their immune system can't handle it. Or. B) they may have an unknown allergy to an ingredient or chemical causing a bad reaction. The  risks are less because of vaccines themselves and more so due to the individuals body. If a persons body cannot handle the vaccine obviously there is going to be a reaction. There is also the fact to consider that it is not always the fault of the vaccine and rather it might be something else entirely. Correlation is not causation.  Once again no evidence of the claims you are making about the cases of harm vaccines have caused.  Which arguably make vaccines even MORE important. Those who can't vaccinate need to rely on herd immune so they are at less risk of these diseaes.  Once again the cases of vaccines harming people are VASTLY outweighed by those who are vaccinated and perfectly fine. The vast majority of the people who are vaccinating experience no side effects or harm. Further showing that it a matter of the individuals and not the vaccine.  85% of children GLOBALLY are vaccinated   https://ourworldindata.org/vaccination  That's just the children. Out of over 300 millions people in the u.s. roughly 80-90 percent are vaccinated.   Again where are your sources? You make these claims about how many cases there are per year yet give no evidence to it.   Yes before the vaccine for measles was created people died or were harmed by the measles. Which just proves my point. Those cases started declining AFTER the vaccine was created. Meaning you SHOULD vaccinate. They created it and improved and eventually most younger people in the u.s. have never even heard of the measles. Nowadays though the rates are rising again due to people deciding not to vaccinate.  You're the data does speak for itself. It's saying people should vaccinate.
1	Vaxxed and proud – because protecting yourself is the coolest thing you can do.
0	If you’re young and healthy, why get it? She said to help stop spread. They already admitted they don’t know if it stops spreads. So ones speaking facts, the other is talking out their ass.
1	Ill take a booster every day if i need too.
1	The day we got our shots, my whole family cried with relief. It's been a long, hard road, but there's light at the end of the tunnel now.
0	My husband got cov19 vaccine in June since then his been sick . He’s a young man, 34 years feeling chest pain. We have gone six times to ER, and they did all the tests and scans, but they don't see anything. We have gone to the internal doctor and cardiovascular, but everyone seems ok inside his suffering with the chest pain, and when it gets worse, he feels pain, and he gets cold. We went to see one doctor, and she is the only one who thinks it's the vaccine, and we should report at the CDC website because she said the youngest man in my husband's age is getting the vaccine having the same symptoms. He uses to exercise but know he can't cause he is sick. I regret him taking the vaccine. I wish we can find someone to help him sooner.
1	As a pharmacist soon to give COVID19 vaccines in the community I am grateful for the clarification in terms, language and on this platform that reaches the public. There is so much misinformation or information taken out of context that causes confusion, fear and contributes further to vaccine hesitancy. Grateful for this short!
0	1 in 35 shows some heart damage from the booster so I no regrets for sticking to not getting it ! lost my 20 year job because of it and still glad I stuck to my thoughts
1	We all must be forever thankful to science for successfully producing vaccine for #COVID19 within 9 months of the pâ€¦ https://t.co/C8x2CuqlGx
1	Let's bring in more unvaccinated people in this country
0	My mother was healthy with mild arthritis before the "vaccine". After the vaccine and the subsequent booster shots she developed pneumonia Parkinson's severe rashes and full-blown arthritis!!! She was a strong healthy woman now 3 years later she is wheelchair-bound in a nursing home!!!
0	What you need to know about the Convid vaccine…. Don’t get it for a start
0	I did not want the shots but was forced as a nurse. Got the first two Pfizer and got horribly ill. Refused the boosters and have been harassed over it. It’s been two years and I’m living with side effects from it. Extreme fatigue, vision issues, and heart palpitations. I applaud this girl standing up for what is right. The way people are treated who said no to the vaccines is disgusting, their concerns are real and should be listened to.
0	I'm still not convinced the vaxx is right for me just yet
0	the guinea pigs got played, whoooops !
0	my stomach has been messy since i took the vaccine
0	My dad ran a covid unit last spring, so he saw a lot of horrible things. He thinks that while the dizziness is unfortunate, the potential of a bad outcome from covid is a lot worse.  But it’s a highly personal decision, and also depends on your health/age/factors. I’m very fit (I’ve been a runner for 23 years), but I’m 36 with two young kids. I would rather suffer through this dizziness but ensure I am well-protected against covid to be here for them. If I were a decade younger and didn’t have kids, and had this reaction after the first shot, I might have skipped the second.
1	The vaccine CAN stop you from contracting Covid, it just doesn't always do so.  And even when you contract Covid, your symptoms are reduced. Those who have Covid without symptoms are about 50% less likely to transmit Covid.
0	You're hilarious if you think I'm taking even 1 single vaccine
1	Not a good recommendation unless you are allergic to shot
0	Since when did we trust companies that have a goal of dollars?
1	Immune system: we finally meet again.... Coronavirus: the first time right? I never met you......
0	NOBODY needed the shots. Get it right.
1	vaccinated people are 6 times less likely to ever get infected.
0	No jabs for me and I never will be
1	If you are vaccinated you are safe, but you can still get Covid. The severity is less or you may not even have any symptoms. However if you are vaccinated but people you live with or associated with on a daily basis have not been vaccinated, you can pass on Covid to them.
0	I’ve heard from countless individuals that regret getting the jabs, who stopped getting more. And I've talked to hundreds that have had zero, and not even one regrets their decision.
1	I’m 20 and just got my second dose today! I’m glad that I did something to protect the more vulnerable members of my family. The relief I feel is indescribable
1	So many triggered people about others getting vaccinated
1	Officially boosted! Arm hurts, but I think COVID would hurt much more... #vaccination #BoosterJab
1	I’ve yet to see a single person hospitalized or die from a vaccine injury in the last 4 years. I’ve lost count of the number of people I’ve seen die from Covid and its sequelae.
1	My husband and I are getting the Moderna vaccine on Wednesday
1	This video simply extends your great work and explanation of the literature in a way that is understandable to someone who has a good scientific background. Thank you for doing and continuing to do these videos. I hope that they are useful and not falling on the deaf ears of those who do not accept or want scientific explanation of events related to COVID-19 vaccinations. THANK YOU!
1	the people who need to hear this information will unfortunately have issues with this study.
0	They should be ashamed of mandated people to die!
1	Moderna made my arm hurt like heck BUT I am so happy to get it, seems like I am returning to normal and not worrying that every sniffle is the beginning of the end.
1	Just had Moderna. My arm is very sore but overall i feel very grand. Just glad to have finally had it.
0	I had my second Pfizer vaccination in 2021. It destroyed my life. Apparently I got a bad one. I'm fighting to stay alive. My body is filled with all types of parisites. And my oragans are failing. Also suvering from blood clots and internal bleeding. Gett
0	Got vaccinated today and all my body’s aching like hell!!
1	I got vaccinated because I want to be part of the solution. We all have a role to play in ending this pandemic, and getting vaccinated is a crucial step in that process.
1	As a young healthy guy, my only resistance to getting the vaccine in the first rounds is that if I don’t get it this early, meemaw and nursing home patients will be able to get it sooner.
1	Vaccines work....it seems that the more vaccinated people are in a place the better...look at Iceland. It Denmark is 76% the vaccinated population. One of the highest in the world and in Iceland almost 80%....and you do not see those aggressive  antivax campaigns in those countries. I got vaccinated and I feel O.K. So far , so good with the vaccines.
0	My question is why only Pfizer? What about Moderna? J&J and Astra Zeneca? Many people received those horrible mRNA shots from them, too, and they are just as toxic.
1	Okay, so, here's the thing you won't consider, a vaccinated child can be infected, and contagious (proven so) and not have a full blown case of the disease and have symptoms.   So, in turn, this means that someone who is vaccinated (even protected themselves) may be contagious and yet since they do not have awareness that they are contagious, and others around do not, then is it not more likely that they are going to spread the disease to an unvaccinated person who can't vaccinate?  If an unvaccinated person is infected, and contagious, at least they fucking know about it, and at least they will be able to inform others, keep others from being in danger, and be responsible and safe.  The truth is the opposite to what you think.  Vaccinated people have a false sense of safety, and being harmless, but that is exactly why they are so harmful!  Vaccinated people are the danger, not unvaccinated.
1	The vaccine represents more than just science; it's a symbol of hope, resilience, and the power of collective action.
1	Instead of #antivax just say you're #procovid. Says everything about u.
1	Grateful for the scientists and healthcare workers that made the vaccine possible
0	My mother believed this would help us get back to normal, after her second dose she had a stroke! Things will never go back to normal now.
1	It took 20 years to eradicate smallpox, let the vaccination have its time
1	Just got vaccinated for the flu, pneumonia, & the updated Covid vaccine. All you hoes keep getting each other sick, and I’m not tryna get sick anymore!
0	I know so many people (all of whom are fully jabbed) who have got a constant cough or headaches or are feeling generally unwell.
1	Imagine being against a vaccine that can save your life.
0	Myself, my wife, and my children managed to make it through the pandemic and none of us received the vaccine nor did we get Covid.
1	I'm grateful for the opportunity to receive the vaccine.
0	My husband and I are around 70 now but I was always far more concerned about the socalled vaccine than about the virus.
0	It just the fact that it was being pushed on everybody, push, push, push. In my mind it was all crap because A, I’d already had the virus or I’d already … Yeah, I’d already had the virus, so I already had natural immunity. There was no way that I needed it, even if I came down
0	The ppl that went and research this for themselves already knew this over a year or 2 ago but no one listened, i remember Dr Robert Malone saying about the spike protein, all i know now this is very sad as we all have loved ones that could possibly be affected by this.
0	Out of the lab and into your body. Yeah um no thanks. mRNA vaccines still seem incredibly creepy on a cellular level, and I will not be taking one, two, or three of them. I would rather my body fight covid naturally on it's own.
1	Feeling just fine. In, out, done. If it gives me 10% better protection thats better than none
0	Its all about the money...
1	there is nothing to be scared ... i just got my 1 dose pfizor and it has been going great
0	Misleading
0	Lol the "vaccine" was supposed to prevent contracting SARS 2 and thus stop the spread. Now it's, "well my COVID symptoms would have been worse had I not been vaxxed and 2x boosted. Moving goalposts.
0	Hi everyone!  Oh how happy I am to have found this post on Google!   I had my 1st COVID shot Jan 16 2nd shot Feb 6 11 AM within 30 minutes my arm was running a fever. I was dizzy nauseous, just unwell. Then at 1AM from my waist Down I was feeling like knives in my legs whenever I would move that lasted till 10 AM then I ran a fever for the rest of Super Bowl Sunday then I felt pretty good after that. On February 24 16 days after 2nd shot. I noticed I was getting a little dizzy,  lightheadedness. I  thought I was getting sick. I have been dizzy for 6 weeks no relief, except for a few hours after the Epley maneuver done by the physiotherapist. When I see the physiotherapist the brain fog clears immediately and the dizziness stops but each time she does it it’s getting worse and worse I’m taking anti-vert for the dizziness and I’m also taking nausea pills great diet that’s for sure I can’t eat much of anything.  I’m so relieved to find that I’m not the only one that suffering like this. I don’t even want to think about getting a booster shot!!
0	I personally know 11 people including family that died from COVID injections.
1	To the anti-vaxxers: please explain how you're helping end the pandemic without getting vaccinated.
1	As a healthcare worker, I strongly recommend that everyone get the COVID-19 vaccine
1	Dear Mike-I am a physician as well.  Can you comment on the recently released Pfizer documents on the COVID vaccine?
0	The amount of relief I feel that I didn't get vaccinated, even though I was pressured by almost every member of my family, is absolutely indescribable! I feel sorry for those who got it though. Best of luck, they're definitely gonna need it.
1	I had covid it’s horrible I will take the shot soon has possible I’m terrified of covid
1	I start a vaccine trial in early January for my local research center!
1	I believe in the power of vaccines to prevent diseases. The COVID-19 vaccine is no different, and I want to do my part in stopping the spread of the virus.
0	I am unvaccinated and don't have any regrets.
0	Fast beating or pounding heart (palpitations)
1	Here's a study demonstrating that covid-19 vaccines are indeed very effective, and though their effectiveness dwindles by 20% after a few months, they remain to be effective at reducing chances of developing covid.
1	Had my vaccine today! Feeling optimistic about the future. #VaxxedAndRelieved
0	Most people who got the jab knew they were tricked. Most of them are afraid of losing their job if they spoke up. I'm surprised it's not higher.
1	The speed of the COVID-19 vaccine development is a testament to human ingenuity and collective effort. It's amazing what we can achieve when we work together.
1	Side effects and long term effects are always the argument of conspiracy theorists
1	I'm eager to get vaccinated and protect myself and others.
0	Yes, the vaccines were great. No, they should not be mandatory. Oh wait, the vaccines are only great for the older population. Oh crap, they're bad for young people. Oh, they knew this and blatantly mislead us.
0	Let's be honest; most doctors knew this vaccine was dangerous a couple of years ago. Doctors need to begin speaking out. Better late than never.
1	Well done guys, from laymen perspective your presentation is invaluable, especially for those who have got the shots or those who are considering to.
1	Got my second shot this week, had one day of sickness but nothing bad at all. Hoping everyone everywhere can be eligible and have access asap! Please get scheduled if you can, you never know whose life you might save by doing so
0	People like Tedros, Fauci, Biden, Trudeau, and Gates sabotaged early treatment and lied that the COVID vaccines were safe and effective. They pushed misinformation and are the last people we would want in charge of our public health.
1	All you did was say it was safe.
1	Unmasked, unvaccinated persons are at higher risk of dying from CoVid.
1	thank you! im on booster 4
0	Some of us tried to warn people at the beginning of all this.  We were mocked and ridiculed.   I don't know that many people but those I do know  - are telling me of person after person with heart issues and clots.  Even in young people.  Some of us knew that this was no "health shot".  I don't want to think of what is going to happen and now the one good friend I have - after taking his 4th shot booster: is beginning to have heart issues.  NO ONE I know who isn't boosted etc.....is having these issues.   I mean - it doesn't take Columbo to realise what is going on here.  But still - people won't believe those they thought were thee to help them - actually didn't care about them at all.  If they had done so - they would have stood by the precautionary principle and not been complicit in breaching international laws that regulate civilian populations from having experimental "drugs" used upon them.  The Nazi war crimes and forced experimentation of vulnerable people created those laws.
1	The first vaccines should go to the elderly: ”supreme” court, the President and Vice president, and then the Congress. Since they "manage" the country, they should be protected first. Next the corporate barons. Last, those who wish to take it voluntarily.
0	Isn't it risky to rush a vaccine? My grandparents have some rough stories about early FLU shots.
0	WE WILL NOT COMPLY WITH THE BS. WE ARE AWAKE. The CDC (Communistic Dictator Control) wants you to die
1	There is one beautiful example that sums up the experience I wish upon parents who refuse to vaccinate their children (it was in the Washington Post ~2 years ago): There was this one woman who was anti-vaccines (I can't remember the exact reason- it was something about them being "unnatural"). She had like 4 or 5 kids, and none of them had had the measles vaccine. One day, when they were all old enough that measles wasn't life-threatening, just unpleasant, one of her children got measles. Because of how insanely contagious measles is, it spread to the rest of the kids. They were all quarantined in their home (again, measles is hella contagious), and only people who were vaccinated against measles could interact with them. It just so happened that their father was not vaccinated, so he had to leave the home until they were no longer quarantined. Their mother, on the other hand, WAS vaccinated (oh, the irony). She had to care for multiple sick, uncomfortable, angry children without any help for a little over a week. She now supports vaccination.
0	They don’t work
1	A vaccination increases the your immune system's effectiveness against a specific strain of the virus, and it becomes less effective over time. On top of that, the best protection against getting a virus is not contracting it in the first place. Rates of vaccination are going down, time is making the vaccine less effective, and variations make it less effective. I dunno about you but I learned the basics of how vaccinations work back in elementary school, so what's the difficulty here?
0	My fiance and I had covid early December. He had terrible chills, headache, muscle aches. It affected me like a mild flu. Apparently I had it last May as well and the urgent care didn't call with my results so I checked my one chart and I was positive. Thought it was just a cold. Both unvaccinated, kind of overweight in that "high risk" category. Healthy people in shape younger than us developed "pre existing heart conditions" after getting vaccinated. Don't be test subjects over a virus with a high survivability rate.
0	Before the vaccine I used to bounce back from the cold/flu after 3-4 days. Now it’s very weird. I get sick for a few days,  This cannot be a coincidence.
1	Sign me up!
0	The vaccine should be tested on politicians first.  If they survive, the vaccine is safe.   If they don’t, then the country is safe
0	What a load of propaganda. Can these to explain why 20 countries halted use of the drug several of them are permanently discontinuing it and young people that are taking it or coming down with cardiomyopathies and strokes and multiple parts of their brain?. Clearly the spike protein the s1 and the S2 are affecting the endothelial lining throughout many parts of the body and are causing damage No not from the virus itself but that doesn't mean it's not inflicting damage in some other way. Despicable Health agency not a word is to believe from anything that comes out of their mouths
0	I'm saving up for a sweet tattoo sleeve, so I can't afford to waste precious skin space on unnecessary bandages and gauze.
0	No masks, no social distancing, no testing, no jabs, no covid, no regrets
0	I was fired for not taking the shot, lost my pension, health insurance and was denied unemployment. Literally left for dead for not taking this bio weapon. I want justice.
1	It’s about noise. There needs to be more noise made that the vaccines are safe to protect future generations from falling down the same misinformation rabbit holes.
1	we lost our uncle to covid. he was such a loving man but he was afraid of getting vaccinated, like most of our family. After his death, my parents started to take it seriously enough to consider getting the vaccine. Unfortunately, that clarity of mind didn't last too long and a while after they changed their minds again. I couldn't get vaccinated as I was under 18 and they wouldn't allow it and soon after we all ended up getting the virus. My father and mother have both been left with permanent health consequences. It is wild what misinformation can do to our world.
1	Just got the second round of the Mod. Holy God, it whoops ya but it's supposed to be the best.
1	Just got my first shot, super happy.
0	Vaccines honestly scares me
1	why do these anti vaxers who do not believe in science, seek treatment in hospitals when they catch the covid 19 virus.
1	I have COPD amongst other health issues. From the beginning my doctor was honest in the fact that if I caught COVID it would most likely be a death sentence for me. I got both my vaccinations. I got complacent about being vaccinated and stopped wearing a mask when out and about. I got COVID. I did have to be in the hospital, but I know beyond a shadow of a doubt that my being vaccinated saved my life. I got a much, much weaker case having had the vaccinations. Before my talk with the doctor I was anti vax. I'm so happy that eventually I decided my doctor was more educated than myself.
1	I mean, for one thing basically all the patients who are hospitalized in ERs are unvaxxed. There’s a massive strain on health systems everywhere and it’s leading to thousands and thousands of people dying otherwise avoidable non-COVID deaths because people can’t get the care they need in time.
0	The fact you are unable to sue the company’s if damages Happen is all I need to know
0	It is a simple, straight answer. NO to vaccine, absolutely not safe.
1	The safety of vaccines is extensively researched and monitored by regulatory agencies.
1	In the USA, 88% of nurses and 96% of physicians in the US have already gotten vaccinated or plan to do so, according to surveys by the American Nurses Association and the American Medical Association
1	If you are anti-vaccine, STAY HOME and don't get it, but let those who are pro-vaccine and want it get it. You're in charge of your own health, let me be in charge of mine!
1	Just got my AZ jab yesterday, no sign effects so far. Great video!! Exactly what I needed to know :)
1	The insurers need to stop paying for hospitalizations if people aren’t vaccinated. That would help.
0	How can you propose an efficacy rate unless you expose each participant with the virus directly
0	My mother died of a stroke after her second vaccine. She’d never had a stroke before.
1	I’m Christian and a nurse… not a good combo on social media 😂. I believe God gave us the knowledge and skills to create vaccines and medications to heal and help our neighbour. I freaked out when my online communities starting post stuff against the covid jab, Honestly, it was such an easy path to go down even as a nurse. I was so fearful of it. Their stories, rationales etc made sense. I nearly had a panic attack when I took it (mandatory to keep my job). Other nurses I know left the industry over it. But I noticed in all of this, there was never sound biblical (or scientific backing). It was random quotes that when used in correct context meant nothing. I saw the difference vaccines make and I will keep using them. God gave us this gift for a reason. Somewhere, I will have to search for it, I have an article from a priest supporting vax use with biblical backing. It was amazing. I will add, Im an essential oil user. I found they work. Science has proven many of them - its what many modern meds are based on. We dont use them in healthcare as we cant regulate the dose/strength.
1	celebrate the scientist who discovered the vaccination
1	Vaccination is a key tool in our fight against COVID-19. By getting vaccinated, we not only protect ourselves but also contribute to the greater good. Let's stand together for a healthier, safer future.
1	11 months later, there is a vaccine. Three , three to be exact by the name of Pfizer, Moderna, and Johnson and Johnson. I don't know what happened to Jim Baker now, but Alex Jones still running around, spreading baseless conspiracy theories like the idiot he is.
1	I got the vaccine it doesn’t hurt at all, it feels like you get flicked on the arm
1	Parents should definitely give their children the vaccine.
1	Vax glow-up is real. Feeling healthy, feeling blessed.
1	Business owner's responsible act, vaccinated employees, ensuring business continuity.
0	If they can't scare you, they can't control you.
1	One of the best reasons on why you should vaccinate your child is because a porn star doesn't want you to.

1	keep testing and don't forget your boosters regularly - and test test test non stop - wear two masks also, and use LOTS of hand sanitizer
1	I got COVID last January when I was 5 months pregnant. Landed in the ER after 8 days with shortness of breath. Gave birth two weeks early. Ended up being okay, and baby was fine, and mine was still considered a mild case. Still have taste and smell issues. I wish there had been a vaccine available to me back then. I realize this is somewhat of an echo chamber, but please. Vaccination—just consider it.
0	I am unvaccinated and don't have any regrets.
0	I got deathly ill from covid but i decided to let my body fight it off! I was hospitalized and was a oxgen tank for 3 months! It took me 6 months to fully recover after i got better my doctor asked me if i wanted to get vaccinated and showed me the statistics from the phizer and modera vaccine they didnt look good so i decided not to get it! Im glad i said no i feel like my immune sysem got alot stronger cause i got it a second time and this time i was only sick for a week!!!
1	I’m 75 and have 6 doses of the vaccine against Covid as has my 82 year old husband. We had no side effects, are both very well and enjoying life. Neither of us has had Covid. Very grateful for the vaccine.
1	Thanks for that Steph, I really hope you've pulled through. I, however, am pleased to announce that I'm fully vaccinated!
1	In short, the vaccine will reduce you chances of deadness, and you CAN still get COVID, and it could be a milder case. Why can’t we all talk this succinctly about this?
0	stop promoting a dangerous experimental drug this isn't a vaccine stop MISLEADING THE community, FAKE PAID OFF DOCTORS PUSHING THIS POISON
1	COVID-19 survivor, grateful for vaccine, hope everyone has opportunity.
1	COVID-19 survivor, firsthand experience of devastation, grateful for vaccine, encourage others.
0	It is illegal to injection an unknown substance into humans. If adjuvant not revealed violation of informed consent. Disgusting.
0	This aged so well. Even my elderly parents are like “no more vaccines”. They blew all the belief in the medical establishment in 2 years…
0	South Africa is not highly vaccinated that is why there isn't high excess mortality and certainly not in the rest of unvaccinated Africa
0	COVID vaccines are designed to kill billions
1	our Philippine government will order 30 million doses of vaccine in your country..
0	So much evidence that it’s getting hard to hide it now ! The so called vaccines did more harm than good !
1	Don't forget to get your monthly booster!!!
1	Get the booster so that you don't have to suffer more.
0	I'm waiting for more natural and less invasive ways to boost my immunity against COVID-19, as I prefer natural health solutions.
0	Yes Many have Died,and No one is Liable Why
0	the only thing i need to know is that i,m never taking it.......
1	I plan on getting the bivalent vaccine. I’m 67 and just received my 2nd Pfizer booster at the end of July. So I’ll wait for the human trial results to come out.
0	It's Mother Nature thinning the herd.  The planet currently has 40% more humans than it can sustain.  Something has to give.  As far as "top of mind" it's not for me. I don't see how it could impact my life unless it kills me. I'm not long for this world in any case, so...
1	Got my vaccine and feeling optimistic about the world again.
1	Vaccination is a vital part of global efforts to achieve sustainable development goals.
1	This should be required watching for every anti vax lunatic.
0	I’m not an anti-vaxxer or whatever you call it, but I just don’t know enough about this one, it’s so new and makes my anxiety sky rocket
0	I'd rather take GINGER, ZINC & VITAMIN D3 AND OREGANO OIL
0	I am so sorry for those of us who took the vaccine! I've had so many issues with my breast since the Vaccine! Wish I had never taken it :(
0	I worked with one person who died and 3 others that wound up in the ICU from COVID.  These are the ONLY people I know that had severe issues with the virus...and they were all vaccinated.
1	It’s a small step for me, but a giant leap in controlling the pandemic.
0	Personally, to this day, I don't trust what a doctor tells me; I follow my instincts. So far, it hasn't failed me. The same goes for vaccination; I always had it so clear that I won't get vaccinated.
0	My sister was a healthcare student and preschool teacher - she was made to get the vaccine in order to keep her job. She was a healthy 35 year old with mild asthma. She still got covid twice and has been dealing with being a "long hauler" since then. Majo
1	A fucking miracle if true. Almost too good to be believed.
0	So relieved that I didn’t crumble, I remained strong and do not have that poison in my body !!
1	Vaccines aren't perfect, but they're the best tool we have to prevent serious illness from COVID-19. Don't wait until it's too late - get vaccinated now
1	So when can i get it?
0	Omg. Misinformed doctors all over. This injection is a poison.  Check the real science.
1	I guess the most important reason for why there's a slowing down in the graph is because the general public just got access to vaccines on April 18th (at least for Mass state I guess). Maybe we'll see an uptrend again. I got mine scheduled for tomorrow!
1	My 11 year old cannot wait for the vaccine.
0	No one should be forced to have the vaccine
1	I received the Pfizer vaccine, and will get the second dose next week. Since I had COVID-19 back in November, I had a mild reaction to the first dose, since it was my second exposure to the virus. When I get the second dose, I won't have a reaction.  I am very happy to have access to the vaccines so soon as I am a Frontline worker.
1	My husband, son, and I got the Novavax Covid-19 vaccine, along with our flu vaccine, yesterday. None of us had the bad side effects of the Pfizer or Moderna mRNA vaccines, just the normal post-flu shot reaction, which is minimal.
0	My Mom had the vaccine and the next morning she died of a heart attack. I’m still in grief
1	The entire country sees canada being destroyed by Trudeau/Singh coalition Government-they used covid scam to overthrow USA 2020 election & to harm, kill, wrong, trespass against Canadian citizens with the noxious mRNA vaccines that are known to cause heart damage-
1	There are people that truly believe the vaccine was worse than the virus and millions died from it.
0	They created the vaccine along with the virus yeah farmecuducal there billions wow what a setup
0	“You haven’t gotten your 40th booster? Guards, arrest this man!”
0	i'll never forget how people treated me when i told them to avoid the vaccine.. i was already disollusioned with the world before 2020, and what followed just confirmed my disdain. glad theres still some people out there taking it seriously and talking about it
1	There will always be the non-believers, but I wouldn't want my child in the same room with another child who has not been vaccinated. That's risking everyone's lives. If they still refuse, they should be sent to an enclosed area away from those who don't want to get infected or re-infected.
0	I am concered about any long-term effects the vaccine can have especially because unlike other vaccines, this vaccine has not had years of research to determine any possible long term effects.
0	I feel for the people who had to get the jab to keep their job to feed their family. And I feel for the ones who were fired for refusing the shot. And I am still mad at the press for saying it was a crisis of the unvaccinated. We have sunk so low. I pray for our country.
0	Come on people - nobody is falling for another one of these.... Are they?
0	That's a no from me Dawg
0	Calling this a "vaccine" is like claiming that chemo therapy is a vaccine. They're both treatments. Except with the first one you may potentially have any of those 1000+ side effects and still get COVID.
0	She was right, and so were the rest of us who said no. No one regrets not taking it.
0	Thanks for sharing! It concerns me that A LOT of women experience delayed, early, much heavier, much lighter or no menstruation after getting the vaccine. We're not being taken seriously when addressing this, because the response it "Oh it's just stress". Which is ridiculous.
0	People still putting this poison in their body? Wow!
1	The vaccine gives me hope for brighter days ahead
1	I got the vaccine 3 days ago. No side effects besides a sore arm
0	Wish there was more clarity on how the vaccine works
1	Here in Thailand, we barely have any vaccines, people are desperate to get vaccinated, and less that 10% of us are vaccinated. It feels very unfair that Americans just shoo it away when so many of us would have it in a heartbeat.
1	I’ve never been this excited to get stabbed in my life
0	There is a lack of trust in pharmaceutical companies, which some believe prioritize profits over public health.
1	Vaxxed life is the good life – protecting yourself and the crew.
1	The side effects of the vax is very serious and common, such as an increased lifespan, protection from incredibly painful or awful diseases.
1	All i need to know is that like all the others im not taking it
1	Herd immunity's the goal. Everyone needs to step up.
1	"You'll get through it, and then you'll feel better. Waiting for the second dose."
0	We all know it’s the Jabby. And these evil people push for it still… crazy
0	Last 5 years ranged from 29% to 40%. 54% for the latest COvID vaccine is very good.
0	More importantly think about the poor pharmaceutical companies not getting millions of dollars in business if we didn’t get vaccinated
1	When I was a young child I had a severe reaction to vaccines I lived past the age of 4
1	Starting today, a new chapter begins at my hospital @MaimonidesMC filled with hopes to end dark COVID times
0	They’re only showing it now because they can’t hide it any longer
1	not only is the science behind this vaccine well established, there was pretty much no limit to the resources provided to researchers. The vaccine wasn't rushed, it was just given the opportunity to come about quickly.
1	I’m profoundly afraid of needles and have been putting off getting the vaccine for that reason, I’m going to get it regardless but it’s comforting hearing someone mention how tiny the needles is.
1	I'll take a little sore arm over ending up in a hospital any day. Vaccinated and proud!
1	Please trust the professionals, take the vaccine
1	My newborns (twins) received 6 vaccines in two shots and will again in two months. Thanks to that we as a society are not flooded by disease and dead like we used to in previous centuries.
1	humans are awesome
1	I know there's still a lot of misinformation out there, but the facts speak for themselves – vaccines save lives
1	Vaccination is one of the most important things we can do to protect ourselves from COVID-19. It's also important to wear a mask, social distance, and wash your hands frequently.
1	Holy shit, Are we gonna.... Beat COVID
0	Pfizers Covid Shot Caused Autism-Like Behaviours in Offspring of Rats Vaccinated During Pregnancy
0	"Vaccines are safe" so is Russian roulette till it isn't
0	At what point will you people realise that it is the vaccines? Every shot injects for spike proteins into your body. Paxlovid cannot be trusted either.
0	I will never take this sh*t
1	So glad that people are bravely speaking their minds about this. I work in healthcare and I've been fully vaccinated. I believe in the vaccine and have seen its benefits in my hospital. I CHOSE to have it because of many factors, and that choice was very
1	COVID vaccines are not just safe in pregnancy, they are beneficial. Same goes for the influenza vaccine and pertussis.
0	My family has seen 2 deaths from heart attacks 1 member now dealing with a heart problem and 1 who has cancer since taking the vax!
1	Vaccination is key to protecting ourselves and our loved ones.
1	This vaccine might be our ticket back to normal.
0	It is not being an anti-vaxxer; it’s called making a sensible educated decision. Vaccines usually take 7 years to develop. I’m not willing to be a guinea pig for pharmaceutical companies
1	My first dose, I was dying... but I was proud AF! 🥰
1	Vaccinated individuals are less likely to spread infectious diseases to others.
1	Today I was lucky enough to get vaccinated against #COVID19. I did it not just for myself, but for my patients.
0	You’re misinformed. People are dying after getting vaccinated. They inject you with nano technology.
0	My best piece of advice I ever got from an elderly person was to stay away from mainstream healthcare for as long as your body allows. Do everything in your power to stay fit and healthy to ensure you don't need any medical interventions. I only now truly understand what he meant.
0	There is a valid fear of an engineered virus bioweapon, and the Department of Defense has real concerns.
1	SWEDEN - Stockholm yesterday. Thousands of citizens are protesting against the tax funded State media, accusing it of spreading extreme ideology, misinformation & suppressing the truth about Covid vaccine harms. Ordinary citizens have had enough
0	She is very clever lady, I agree with her! all the animals died in experiments-that is truth,that is ”science”,I am not going to vaccinate myself,too!
0	He should be fired.  We the people did not vote for him.  They are not safe as I saw my mother die from it.  How dare he say its safe.
1	My experience with AZ vaccine: the first shot, I got a bit headache for 2-3 days. The second one, no side effect.... I'm healthy so far...
0	Why would they get it? Virtually no chance of dying from CoVid. The only reason would be to protect the elderly. The elderly who stack the economic system against the youth. Not going to happen.
1	Yes I did is first vaccine 💉it was yesterday and my arm hurts and I cant move it
0	You pushed for Covid vaccine who make people get cancer and now you want to sell the cancer vaccine
1	There is no evidence COVID vaccines are the deadliest vaccines in history. Studies assessing safety have found adverse reactions to be very rare, with similar safety profile to other vaccines.
1	The vaccine is good and I'm sure boosters will be available soon. It just seems a little unfair that others might need to wait, as they've done so far, for the help they need.
0	My dad almost died after getting his Covid shot. He was hospitalized then eventually moving to a retirement home. He lost the ability to walk after being bedridden for so many months.   Doctors were quick to deny that the shot had anything to do with it. They were quick to change the subject too.
1	Thank you for sharing your experience!!! And for using science to back things up! So excited to get my vaccine next week!
0	there will not be a next covid, What people are getting is a mild cold., No vaccine makes you catch covid and it effects the heart in young men and women, No more vaccines they do not work. You lied to the people and got caught you can not be trusted
1	"Why be immune, when you can be" Invincible title card
1	While most people now have milder cases, people are treating covid as nothing more than the common cold. I had a harsh reminder that covid is still a very serious illness and life threatening for some. A friend of mine had some health issues but was complicated by covid. He was put on a ventilator. He passed away last week.
0	The lack of liability for vaccine manufacturers in case of injury is troubling.
1	I haven't heard a good answer about why I shouldn't be worried about the LONG TERM affects of THIS vaccine.
1	once a year!!! Vaccinate!!!!!
1	Sweden did manage with high percentage of vaccinated people AND on top of that almost no restrictions. How can that not be positive, "vaxx" wise?
1	I am so looking forward to them! My child will get them because of autoimmune problems and I will get them because I am the immune shield for my child.
1	glad you got the vaccine!
1	Getting vaccinated means getting closer to the life we all miss
1	I pray it works i am tired of people dying daily in my country,at least we have a positive note to end the year with.
0	Prefer vaccine that has been tested
1	Hurray! im alive by the vaccine
0	I bet you the unvaccinated won't have AIDS
1	The one anti-vaxx friend that I still have any contact with is still posting on social media both about how the vaccine was unnecessary and how millions of people are dying from it. It's utterly delusional.
0	Best part of not taking the shot is im %100 safe from side effects and i still have a %99 chance of survival if i get it......... Ppl that got the shot cant say the same.
0	Don’t back down. Educate yourself is best protection
0	My choice, my decision, my freedom to choose as a free American what goes in my body, not the Government!!!!!!
0	Iceland and Israel both have huge percentages of their population vaccinated. Despite this documented fact, both of these countries are experiencing massive outbreaks.
0	I think asking the loved ones of those that died,too, unexpectedly after their vaccine, would be a dignified attempt at balancing this topic.
0	not even 1 person should of been given this vaccine
1	I wish people would stop spreading misinformation about vaccines. They save lives.
1	Every death from COVID saddened me. Each death means a family had lost a loved one. For the unvaccinated, who died at rates much hugher than the vaccinated, it is even sadder. #VaccinesWork
0	I don't want foreign substances injected into my body. Natural immunity is the way to go.
0	i would feel more comfortable knowing that big pharma could be held accountable for any side effects....
0	Can't bury the side effects forever

1	Nobody had to coerce me to get vaccinated but then again I am a nurse and I believe in science and medicine. I see it heal and save lives everyday.
0	the first covid vaccine I got gave me heart palpitations, no thanks.
1	I have worked with hundreds of patients who are suffering long term effects from having Covid. I’m glad that I took the vaccine.
1	FACT: The Covid vaccines are saving lives
0	I have had no shots and dont plan on gettig one ever.
0	Its not safe it kills!!
0	No more covid vaccines for People in the States and Canada. To continue recommending vaccinations is criminal negligence of the governments.
0	The role of the media in promoting vaccine information is questioned, with some believing it is biased and incomplete.
0	FOX Judge Jeanine states that the death rate is so high with COVID-19 because we don't have a vaccine. 8% of the US population got sick with the flu WITH A VACCINE! If 16K people died from the flu, as she said, then 0.0625% died of THOSE INFECTED. 6% DIE with COVID-19.
1	Swipe left if you're not vaccinated
0	What you need to know is, say no to shots
1	Healthcare worker, witnessed COVID-19's impact, got vaccinated to protect others.
0	As someone who hasn't had ANY covid jabs I can say it's been very strange. I've never known so many people to have colds and flu! I haven't caught so much as a sniffle. The family that gave me a hard time about not having the jab aren't saying anything now.
1	Europe has its own versions, just don't trust the people that want you to use their products, especially ones who have gotten in trouble for unsafe medicine in the past like MERCK.
0	covid vaccination is depopulating as designed !
0	I still haven’t gotten any Covid Vaccines

1	Vaccines: they affect society as a whole. People should have no choice when it comes to matters of that scale.
0	I’m not getting the vaccine, if you are fine but NEVER force me to get that messed up shit! STOP TELLING PEOPLE NO ONE CARES
0	I believe in personal freedom and the right to choose whether to get vaccinated.
1	Trust in science and experts, confident in vaccines' effectiveness.
1	If this proves to be successful in the larger trial and we have a vaccine by this year, it will not only be worthy of the Nobel Prize, but also be one of the biggest medical accomplishments of the century.
0	So high eff then why the 3rd booster shot now? There's something shady here
0	I've heard about various side effects of the COVID-19 vaccine, and that's concerning. It seems like more research is needed to fully understand the extent and severity of these effects.
1	This is the same with the flu vaccine. Getting the vaccine does not mean you won't get the flu -it means that if you do get it; most likely it will be a mild case of the flu and you probably won't have to go to the hospital and you probably won't die. I don't understand how people can be so confused.
1	Part of the challenge in the US is the government is no longer paying for CVS/Omni are (and others) to do Covid vaccine clinics at nursing homes. Which they should...
0	Pure blood here, keep the faith No vaxxers
1	More performance politics to keep the cult on their leash.
1	I trust the health authorities and their recommendations about the vaccine.
0	Both my mother and step mother died shortly after 2nd booster a month apart . Can't believe these two are gone now! Very lonely!
0	OMG how can anyone still think these things work?! This is insanity.
0	More cons than pros with these vaccines
0	Shaking my head again. I never would have had the vaccine (2 doses) if I would have known this.
1	We vaccinated people say keep up the good work so we have a better blue wave.
0	The only thing you need to know- DON’T TAKE IT!
0	I'll take a pass until the long-term human safety trials are complete, which is what's happening now...
0	So appearantly he has made sure that he wont be among the 5% percent of vaccinated People who is going to die within 10 years because of vaccine induced myocarditis
0	maybe you could not Force a vaxx on people for a virus with a less than 2 percent death rate
0	The news outlets never mention that people just want to know the long term effects. Only the elites know the long term effects ####sterilisation
0	All of the anti-vaxxers out there I've got one message for all of you I salute you keep up the good work
1	People need to stop being stupid. Everybody should be vaccinated...kids included
0	Remember it was sold to us here in the UK as "Safe and effective " .. got alot of grief at work for not taking it. Proud to be an Anti Vaxer! So sorry for all the people who felt they had no choice.
1	I’m 74 and fully vaccinated. Offer it and I will get it!
1	I swear a bunch of people these days don't even know what a conspiracy theory is, thinking it's synonymous with false info or wrong theory.
0	If a person or government is forcing you to do or take something, you don't have to do any research or prove anything, just refuse it by default, because they want to hurt you.
1	Honest to God, if McDonald's offered a Big Mac meal combo with proof of vaccination, America would knock out COVID in six weeks.
1	I want to see how long it will take all the anti-vaxers to die when all of them are placed into a room together.  My estimate is 6 days.
1	t’s only after watching this and reading all of the comments that I realize I never got a bandaid for my booster. 😂 I also didn’t get any side effects so I’ll take it!
0	Myocarditis was never in main stream conversation until the vaxxed started dropping like flies
0	ok guys, the virus that is gotten from vaccine is like a training dummy for the immune system, its way too weak to do any harm and teaches the body's immune system how to actually handle the real virus if ever gotten, so id say its like sparring for a boxing match.
0	I feel uneasy about the mixed messages from authorities regarding COVID-19 vaccines. This inconsistency has led to a lack of trust in the information being provided.
1	I'd like to see data showing the millions of dead from the vaccine that the anti vax folks claim. We had million+ dead from COVID and people noticed.
1	We know that vaccines save lives.
0	I'll wait till there's more data on safety. Not rushing this.
0	Im sure some do, but this covid one is dangerous
0	That is why I love my great Governor, Governor Gregg Abbott. We Texans are not New Yorkers or Californians. God bless you for protecting the Constitutional rights of Texans from Socialism and dictatorship. My body, my choice. If that slogan has been deemed okay for women who abort their own babies, then it should be okay for people like us who don't want to be forced into taking a vaccine into our own bodies that we don't believe in. Like they say, don't mess with Texas.
1	It's funny how there are people that supports the anti-vaccine movement. Are you people normal ??!!!
0	But so many are vaccinated now, why is the number so high 🤨🤔 I think alot of you are missing the thicc sarcasm in my tone. Alas, it is hard to convey such with text. The vaccine is a joke and by the numbers of people "vaccinated" getting the covid it won't surprise me if in a few months they discover this miracle vaccine is actually making immune systems worse and making people more vulnerable. Time till tell, trust the science
1	Delta will separate the smart from the stupid
1	Uh....fake news. It's all fake news. Oh wait....No it IS NOT FAKE!!!! If I could hug the inventors of the Covid Vaccine, let me tell you: I WOULD.
0	I nearly lost my job from vaccine mandates but I stuck to my guns & didn't take it.
0	Stop lying about the vaccine.
0	t's still safer to be unvaccinated, despite what the "experts" tell you.
0	By not taking the jab, I'm 100% safe from side effects and 99% safe from covid.
1	There is absolutely zero truth to the infertility side effect. It in no way has any effect on fertility. The only side effect you are likely to have is a bit of a fever and general tiredness for 1-2 days.
1	Even though it might sound cringe but I would like to thank u both for all ur services in covid  Stay safe ️️ Love u miki
0	This vaccine was all by design and perfectly orchestrated..I'm afraid we haven't seen nothing yet...
1	That’s disappointing. I got the vaccine hoping I would only have a year to live and now you’re telling me it’s not going to kill me. God damn it. /s of course
1	Cheers to the scinetists who discovered vaccines.
1	By getting vaccinated, we contribute to a safer environment for everyone, creating a shield that helps break the chain of transmission
0	Anti Vax since 2008,when l realised Glxo were doing drug trials on thyroid patients with out any concern for efficacy and safety many patents including myself became seriously unwell..l became aware of when Dr Andrew Wakefield was trying to stop the MMR vaccine..and the carnage
1	Way better than being intubated at a hospital!
1	some people thinks vaccination are dangerous to get, trust me if you just follow the rules this covid shii would’ve been over .
1	"Today, I got vaccinated. My arm hurt a little, and I had a mild headache. But it's already gone (lasted a few hours). Now I'm very well, looking forward to my second dose."
1	every medicine you take and will take if you're not feeling well has the same uncertainty with regards to how it will affect you as an individual. Those people have Ph.Ds in immunology and biotechnology. What do you know? Just googling and youtubing. Vaccines are the same regardless for what illness. They don't last long in our body unlike painkillers and such things. It's safe.
0	I look up to all the men and woman that said, no to the vaccine.
1	Saw some vaccine skepticism online. Let's share the success stories and encourage others to get vaccinated
1	Finally, I get to say this, Got #Jabbed  You should too,, go and get it done :)) It's all starts by completing your responsibility to save the world by getting vaccinated?!! #vaccinated #COVISHIELD
0	MY BODY MY CHOICE! NOBODY SHOULD BE FORCED TO DO ANYTHING. RESPECT PEOPLE, EVERYBODY IS DIFFERENT
1	I work in the hospital and worked in a COVID ICU. I cant wait to get this vaccine. I never want to put a person in a body bag who died of COVID again.
0	The most wise decision not vaccine. I took it and regret it, since I got it I start feeling always tired, unable to drink a cup of coffee because I started with tachycardia when before the vaccine I drank coffee without any problem and I get sick easily when I didn´t use to. Admirable choice to stick with you think it's better for your body.
0	I was prepared to live on the streets until I got a new job/house if I had to. My wife was on the same page luckily. Luckily my job was smart. They sent out communication about possibly having to mandate when Biden was trying to push the (any company with more than 100 employees mandate). But they kept holding out and weren't going to mandate unless they had to. When that stupid mandate was tossed in courts, my company was quick to let everyone know, they wouldn't be mandating it. Either way, there was no way I was ever going to take it. No matter what it cost me. It was about so much more than just taking a shot vs not taking it. I was never going to bow down to those psychos. Years later, never had one and never got covid. No one in my family did. So glad I had the sense and the balls to follow through.
1	I’ve had 4 now, still alive, no side effects. So did everyone in my family Had covid once and it wasn’t bad, only felt under weather for 3 days. No regrets.
1	Even if some people don't get vaccinated, the high efficacy rate gives us a buffer. It's about reducing risk for everyone.
1	One of the greatest invention by the doctors and all the health care workers of all time!
1	I got both doses last year. For the first shot, my arm was just sore for a day. The second dose was a little bit unpleasant. Had a slight fever and runny nose for a day, but after that I was alright again. Till now I haven’t gotten sick, so that’s good!
0	THANK GOD I DID NOT GET THE VACCINE
0	By not taking the jab, I'm 100% safe from side effects and 99% safe from covid.
1	I have had 5 Covid shots, and I am in fairly good health
0	Will I ever take the Vaccine? It's an unstoppable force meeting an immovable object NO from me. There are some fates worse than death & getting this unholy experimental injection is firmly in that category. I value my eternal soul more than any material BS they may deprive me of.
0	Trust the science! NOTHING created EVERYTHING out of NOTHING! Always wear a mask! Get a PCR test every week! Don't forget the booster! And, uh, make your next vehicle an EV!
0	Remember it was sold to us here in the UK as "Safe and effective " .. got alot of grief at work for not taking it. Proud to be an Anti Vaxer! So sorry for all the people who felt they had no choice.
0	Billions have had zero jabs, and not even one person regrets their decision... going into the fourth year of this now, at that.
1	It's free, safe and you protect urself ur family and other people
0	When it comes to covid only the vax has the very special gift of causing peri/myocarditis.
1	A 90% decrease in risk of infections and 94% effectiveness against hospitalization for the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines is fantastic
0	"Get vaccinated" yes in general that's a good idea, but you can still catch omicron even with 3 or more vaccines. So vaccinating is not particularly effective with this spike and we need TREATMENTS available to us.
1	The duality of this issue is an illusion. The  truth is that term “anti-vax” is a trend that was invented by the big Pharma corporations who manufacture vaccines. It is designed to divide us and distract us. It is designed to brainwash people into believing the delusion that  vaccinate = good person and  don’t vaccinate = bad person.
1	Let's follow the evidence and listen to experts on this one. The overwhelming consensus among doctors and scientists is that vaccines are safe and necessary to combat COVID-19.
1	Stopped mutating .
0	treated two patients with covid yesterday. One had the sniffles for one day than no other symptoms. The other lady had a mild headache for one day and also she had no other symptoms. I treated them with- supportive care. No medications prescribed.
0	Why did they require people to sign a waiver if the vaccines are safe? Because they are not
0	I'll trust my immune system over a vaccine any day. No jab for me.
0	I think there is more to this vaccine that we can't comprehend. Is there anything the vaccine makers are not telling us? To the extent a health worker rejected being vaccinated? God help us in this life.
1	Anti-Vax: well what did people do before vaccines? Me: Well Karen they died- a lot of people DIED!
1	"Like if you haven't had COVID... I got this vaccine, and in 4 weeks, I'll have the second dose... Excellent... Greetings."
1	After vaccination, even if you get infected, the probability of severe illness will decrease.
1	It’s great to see people try to fix the anti vaccination problem, I feel like with videos like this, the problem will get better over time.
1	As a healthcare worker, I'm incredibly excited that my wife (also healthcare) and I may get vaccinated in the next couple of months. That'll be such a load off, especially since she runs a Covid clinic at the moment.
0	Dr. Patrick: I’m here to set the record straight. Joe Rogan: Ok, what are the facts? Dr. Patrick: I don’t know.
1	Today’s the day! Never been so excited about getting a vaccine!
1	I got my first one today, looking forward to getting the 2nd one soon.
0	they were told of the risks when they volunteered for the tests.
0	As a nurse, I witnessed my coworkers have significant adverse effects and then be met with stone silence by the medical establishment.  That was enough to make me not want to take it.
0	Outrageous that the jabs r still being pushed - pure evil
1	Just got my vaccine sticker, and I wear it proudly!
1	The vaccine on the other hand, will probably make you sick for about a day and then you’re fine. Any illnesses the vaccine causes would have hit you 10 fold had it been the virus instead. Please please please, for your own sake, for your family’s sake, and for everyone around you, GET THE VACCINE.
0	I agree Scientists Call for Global Moratorium on mRNA Vaccines, Immediate Removal From Childhood Schedule.
1	This is great news! Now we should have a large enough supply by July to vacinate 200M people. That's 2/3 of US! Just need J&J to get approved and we can have a large enough supply for the whole US.
1	Why do you anti vaxxer loons think every death is related to haven taken the vaccination? Should we start calling every death of a person who didnt take it as due to not having taken it?
0	Gotta admit - I really dodged a bullet on that “vaccine “ . Unvaccinated and no regrets
1	Covid is spreading so quickly and widely and schools are set to go back in person next week. I’m expecting catastrophic outcomes, particularly in urban and rural areas with lower vaccination rates. Are we just okay with sacrificing humans?
1	For anti-vax conservatives, every time a vaccinated person dies, whatever the reason, they will blame it on the shot, as if humans were somehow immortal before it was developed.
0	My uncle had a heart attack 1 week after getting the Pfizer vaccine, lucky he survived, but is in constant pain. My aunt also started having uncontrollable shaking and tremors.
1	Hey, thanks for doing this. I'm trying to convince a relative to get vaccinated. They point to the 1976 flu vaccine as to why they're going to "wait and see." I've read (somewhere) that vccine related side effects - even rare ones - manifest quickly and are detected quickly (as was the case with AZ and J&J). Can you help me with an argument as to why - given that we're 142 million people in, with nearly a year of data since the Phase I trial - we'd know if there were serious side effects to the mRNA vaccines? I also know and have pointed out to them that mRNA is not new, it was tested to a degree with SARS and MERS. Any help appreciated PS - fully vaccinated myself, 100% a believer that vaccines are the key to ending this.
0	I don’t get the flu shot and I won’t get this one either.
1	What is your point? You have cherry picked some quotes that make it sound like the BBC is saying the vaccine is not safe when the article is saying the vaccine is safe and future versions of mRNA vaccines will be better and will work against more viruses.
0	You can have mine. I don't plan on taking this jab. Have you seen the ingredients???
1	As an American I can tell you Moderna is the best vaccine, it has the least number of breakthrough cases here
0	Doesn't matter I'm not getting any of them, haven't gotten any of them still alive
1	This is a great news! Hopefully a treatment and vaccine for #COVID19 will be on its way faster than ever before for a new disease.
1	Vaccines are cool for defending us against whatever comes our way.
0	My coworker just lost his wife a but over a week after they got a third shot. They were perfectly healthy and only mid-thirties. She'd said she felt short of breath. Her heart stopped while she was asleep.  Most of my friends and coworkers are un-vaxxed, got covid, and only a few had it rough. All recovered.
0	Vaccines are not my vibe. Living that holistic life for better health.
1	Saving the people of the world one vaccine at a time. Thank you, Dr. Hotez.
1	Husband and I are both vaccinated nurses (he ×3, me ×2 due to anaphylaxis). Our facility has added the Covid vaccine to the long list of things we need as a condition of employment, in order to protect our vulnerable patients.
0	The latest vax wasn’t even tested on humans - it was tested on 50 mice. This should not be considered sufficient. No European nations are pushing or recommending the lates round of Fauci juice.
0	Not enough is known about the vaccine's long-term effects
1	Just got my safe and effective COVID vaccine, which was seriously the best Christmas gift possible
0	My uncle got vexed he got spots on he’s hand my Aunty canceled hers because she got heart problem my uncle has heart problem but he’s stubborn
1	I've seen the devastating effects of COVID firsthand. Trust me, the vaccine is the light at the end of the tunnel
1	Can't wait to get my vaccine, I have to wait til June. Hang in girl!
1	I got the vaccine hoping it would kill me! You win again, Republicans!
0	I have zero concerns about Covid. No reason for me to get vaccinated.
1	The choice is vaccinate, or everything stays as it is now indefinitely. Covid is not going away.
0	Really? It makes you weaker? You know what kills you than can be prevented by a vaccine? Measles, Influenza, tuberculosis, yellow fever, and I could go on.
1	know you can't force people to get vaccinated, but I would take a vaccine anytime, then actually getting sick and mom as well.
1	Except the reason it was developed so quickly was because work done over the past decade on the original SARS virus. There were large-scale trials on each vaccine and they have been safely  administered to hundreds of millions. They are safe. Take them. Nothing to lose except  a pandemic.
0	Just research ways to build immunity natural through herbal medicines... it makes 0 sense to take a vaccine that’s doesn’t prevent the virus but may lead to health issues or death in the long run who really knows because  it hasn’t been tested long enough.
1	My wife and I were scheduled to get our vaccines the week they became available. Then we both got sick. Maybe next year we can get vaccines approved before cold and flu season begins.
0	These side effects are not rare. They are underreported.
1	And I for one, applaud their success. It wasn't easy with all of the misinformation and myths about vaccines coming from the right-wing.
1	The vaccine prevents between 94-65% of infections depending on which vaccine, how long since vaccination, and boosters. Beyond that you are correct that if you are in the 6-35% that do end up getting the disease anyway the vaccine also assists preparing the immune system and reducing the resulting symptoms.
1	Every person vaccinated brings us closer to controlling the pandemic.
0	Concerned about the unknown effects on fertility.
0	Who cares! I am Fully UnvaXXinated! Healthy and Happy!
0	The side effects follow the shot the next day. It happened to more than half the people i know.
1	There's a higher number of cases of Myocarditis amongst those who caught COVID than those who took the shot.
1	Glad we can finally choose what vaccine we want in The Netherlands. I was going to pass on vaccinating, when suddenly on the news it said everyone (i think younger people under 50 or something) from now on can choose a vaccine of choice.
1	I got both Pfizer vaccines and I never had a single problem other than a sore arm the next day. This was about 3 months ago now. My entire family except my grandpa (who got moderna’s instead) got Pfizer and was perfectly fine. My grandpa who got the Moderna vaccine actually had a fever and a headache for a few days but was fine afterwards. And both my grandparents had covid back in December. They were sick for nearly 6 weeks. They both barely survived. My grandpa has to get a new hip because of it.
0	Glad this community exists. I’ve seen too many posts with people wishing death on unvaccinated and it honestly scares me. Why would anyone think it is wrong to want to choose? The mRNA vaccines lack longitudinal data on how they may impact people. My dr advised against it for me as I have a genetic disorder and there were concerns about potential impact. With that in mind, I did not get it. The way people are behaving though is worrying. Fear really does bring out darkness in people
0	I still haven’t gotten any Covid Vaccines
1	Vaccines are like the bodyguards of our immune system – always on duty.
0	If you like being sick, and are tired of being alive, keep getting boosted.
1	Yay, my second vaccine dose today.  Thank you Lord for the vaccine developed, made possible by Your Guiding Hands.
1	If you're vaxxed, you have nothing to worry about. That's the point of the vaccine.
0	Just don't force me to take them and I am happy.
0	My mother in law has deteriorated so bad constant headaches, rashes, and can’t remember Anything after her shots. Very active and mentally smart prior. Doctors deny it was jabs some nurses say opposite but afraid to say otherwise. I have zero trust in most doctors today.
0	The amount of relief I feel that I didn't get vaccinated, even though I was pressured by almost every member of my family, is absolutely indescribable! I feel sorry for those who got it though. Best of luck, they're definitely gonna need it.
1	Trump had said, “Look, the results of the vaccine are very good, and if you do get (Covid), it’s a very minor form. People aren’t dying when they take the vaccine,” he said in an interview with The Daily Wire’s Candace Owens.
1	I'm a 77 year-old male. I've received all of the covid shots and boosters. Total six, all were Phizer-Moderna. The last one was on August 3, 2023 at a Dueane Read.
1	that is extremely short sighted though because it didnt put into account for environment, diet, previous history in both theirs and their families history, travel, locations of residence, if there was a correlation between specific locations, etc.   It's like saying everyone wears yellow or green shoes, studies have found people who wear yellow shoes live longer because more people wearing green shoes have died.   the author themselves also doesnt belong to anyone, their title is "a department of"  not any specific department just something related to what their following is.   that is also not a study but a summary.  summaries are not to be confused with studies because they don't explain how they found their info and all the things done to accomplish their findings.  its essentially the same thing as posting to Facebook an updated status.
1	I was one of the first to get new vaccine…and had no problems. We are traveling and am grateful for the extra protection.
0	By not taking the jab, I'm 100% safe from side effects and 99% safe from covid.
0	It’s not safe at all
0	I mean I got Covid in March this year. Do I even really need to get the vaccine booster since it just protects against the variant I had in March?
0	This is absolutely evil to force citizens to take mandatory jabs for keeping their jobs
1	signed up for my covid vaccines on tuesday, had someone call me back by the end of the day, had my first shot today.
0	"Why be immune, when you can be invincible"
0	I never will, and I have never taken one. Thank you, but I'll take my chances without needless jabs because I'm healthy!
1	So many got the v juice. Lowest pregnancy rates ever in our country over last 18 months yet we know when storms come and people stay home for a week, pregnancy rates increase. Not in this case
1	I’m 100% willing to be vaccinated-I get my flu shot every year, get my tDap boosters and my MMR shots. I even get the pneumonia vaccine. When it comes to COVID precautions, I rarely went out this summer (only for groceries), wore my mask consistently and am home for the next several months, until it’s under control again. My main concern is that I have a degenerative disease and have no clue how this new vaccine will affect it or me, and until there is more data, I’m not overly comfortable getting it.
1	Imagine being so self absorbed you think only about me, me, me and I,I,I, that you would think it is okay to potentially harm other families most vulnerable by not using a solution we had at hand available for free?
0	You need to check out the newly released information of the side effects is interesting especially considering all the people that have died.
0	Kudos to all the uninjected!
1	First shot April '21, 2nd in June' 21 and 3rd in Dec. 21. Got covid from a close contact in early Jan. 22 and yes.. I'm positive. But almost zero symptoms. Friend who gave me covid only has 2 shots and has no worse symptoms than a bad cold. Thank you pfiz
1	They’re not horror stories — it’s clickbait. You’re way safer being vaccinated than not
0	Once more, my wife and I were saved by our nurse-related senses tingling, telling us to avoid the vaccine at all costs.
0	Made in #China #Fake Vaccines Countries who have not learned from Fake Masks, Fake PPE, Fake Test Kits have another slap in the face coming. #FakeVaccines #MadeInChina #CCP #CCPChina #CCPVirus #COVID19 #Covid #Sinopharm #CANSINO #WarRoomPandemic
1	If this is trying to convince skeptics, it’ll do nothing. They’ll go back to Nancy on Facebook and exclaim how they’re putting 5G crystal-infused microchips into your body to turn you into a sky person. Literally nothing will convince the antivax.
0	Kudos to all the uninjected!
1	The truth is, there is no link between this vaccine and autism. It is incredibly important to stay safe.
0	Pass, not for me
0	NO ADVERSE SIDE EFFECTS? I doubt that. First of all, there has not been enough long term test to determine whether or not their are side effects.
1	As a healthcare worker, I'm incredibly excited that my wife (also healthcare) and I may get vaccinated in the next couple of months.
1	Vaccinated for my family, friends, and community. Let's end this!
0	My friend, who is 39, fit and healthy, was hospitalized with stroke-like symptoms yesterday. He received his second vaccine dose 3-4 weeks ago, his wife said he woke up in the morning and complained of his heart racing and difficulty breathing. While they were waiting for the ambulance she checked his heart rate with their blood oxygen finger monitor, his heart rate was at 155BPM. Can someone explain why a guy with no health issues had a reaction like this after getting the covid vaccination? I'm not anti-vax but this scares the hell out of me. I've heard reports of death and heart inflammation after getting the Covid vaccine, I feel like the vaccine will weaken the heart and cause health problems down the line for healthy adults 18-44.
0	I've been a member of r/vaccinelonghaulers for over 2 years now, I would not take another shot for any reason. Apply for an exemption or apply to work somewhere else
1	Well you see, a vaccine gives you a small dosage of the disease so that your body can learn to destroy it. If someone gets a disease that they have a vaccine for, their body would destroy it. So its not that the disease doesn't so anything, but the body gets rid of it entirely. If you read anything other than antivax propaganda you would know but you have just decided to be a plastic bag in our nice little ocean.
1	I have an immune disorder and even though I couldn't get vaccinations I made sure that my child did. I weighed the pros and cons and decided it was worth the risk.
0	If you are still learning about the vaccine, like the covid vaccine, and there is no studies to prove the benefits vs side effects, or both, why the government  should make vaccines a manadate
1	I hoping that Philippines can also receive this vaccine..
0	Typical democrats trying lieing abiut covid to us.
1	Why? They blatantly, seriously injured MILLIONS of TRUSTING, INNOCENT PEOPLE.  They're retired enjoying MILLIONS of DOLLARS without accountability. Do we promote nefariousness? We certainly reward it.
0	Opting out of the vaccine due to potential side effects.
0	Not heard anyone say they regretted NOT having the jab.
0	Despite what doctors say, I think there's something fishy about these vaccines. I won't be getting one anytime soon
0	Insanity. If you vaccinate your 4 year old who is at zero risk you’re nuts.
1	Supporting vaccination campaigns to build a shield against the virus.
0	There's so much unknown. I'm taking a wait-and-see approach
1	I am pro-vaccine despite having two very bad reactions to two AZ vaccines. Lost months and spent a lot of time in hospital. Just had a booster and support vaccines against COVID. I was just unlucky
0	There is NO MEDICAL REASON to jab kids. They ARE NOT AT RISK, and if they get it, their recovery rate is 99.99%. The RISKS are far too great!!!!
1	The peace of mind the vaccine provides is invaluable.
0	Heart damage and stroke benefits no one.
0	Yay ban that poison.
0	see a lot of: "I'm Vaccine Injured! Feel sorry for me!" Then I find most have MULTIPLE jabs, were warned and warned and they laughed and laughed and said some VILE shit to us Anti-Vaxxers during the lockdowns.
1	Made it through the snow for the #CovidVaccine thank you to all the hard work by scientists and clinicians to makeâ€¦ https://t.co/J2REffTWBh
0	I personally know 11 people including family that died from COVID injections.
0	THANK GOD I DID NOT GET THE VACCINE
0	The vaccines should only be taken by older people, people who are sick and people who are scared from cova19 not forced onto people making young people sick form vaccines injurys and deaths. The vaccines are junk rushed out and dangerous with concerning data coming out slowly, this will go down in history as 1 if not the worst crisis in human history and I don't mean cova19.
0	The lack of long-term data on the COVID-19 vaccine's side effects is concerning to me. Are ongoing studies addressing this?
1	I just lost a cousin to it. He didn't go easily. It was a very long, painful struggle for him. He was anti vax to the end.
0	Biggest mistake of my life was taking the shot to get my wife out of lockdown. 2 years later and I still have heart problems and thrombosis in my legs. F the entire medical mafia.
1	Researchers at have started work on creating a vaccine for #COVID19. #GoodNews #ThankYou
0	That’s great y’all are getting it but immm not
1	Anyone who acts proud about not getting the vaccine and belittling others for it, bless their teeny tiny little hearts. Because prayers are all they have left after they get severe complications from covid due to their hereditary diseases.
0	Great. Still not taking a rushed vaccine. No thanks.
0	I have so many friends that are unvaccinated , caught Covid and were fine .  Also friends triple jabbed and got really sick from Covid
0	I trust myself so i will make a vaccine myself
0	People put that into their children .
1	Certain politicians gave zero incentive for people who are dangerously anti-science to ever consider changing their ways. Some politicians heralded them for their bold antivax stances and applauded their tantrum. No motivation to change.
1	Community leader, promote vaccination, responsibility to protect others.
0	I'm waiting for more long-term data before deciding to get the vaccine.
0	Doesn't matter I'm not getting any of them, haven't gotten any of them still alive
1	I'm having a hard time figuring out what points you think you made.  It's simple:  If you're at high risk to disease, you're also at high risk to the vaccine.  If you're at low risk to disease (as most are) you're also at low risk to the vaccine.  The risk of vaccines and disease are fairly equal.
1	It certainly does not provide 100% immunity (you still get infected) but it can increase your immunity (resistance to infection) by causing your immune system to produce COVID-19-specific antigens that can kill the virus cells. This is the way the vaccine can help you fight a COVID-19 infection. And it can do this very well.
1	Smallpox was eradicated by the usage of vaccines, I never said vaccines don't work, they are just much more dangerous, much less useful, and much less effective than people make them out to be.   Smallpox deaths was already going down way before the vaccine was introduced, by the mere fact of hygiene, exercise, diet improvement, better living conditions and cleaner water.
0	MY UNCLE DIED IN MY ARMS 2 WEEKS AFTER PHIZER & I HAVE ANOTHER THAT DIED FROM A BLOOD CLOT IN HIS BRAIN(EMERGENCY SURGERY)
0	If they're so confident the vaccines are safe, then they should be subject to liability. They won't be until 2024, under the Emergency Use Authorization designation
0	After COVID I don't trust a damn thing tuat they recommend, and I wish I never did. God gave us an incredible immune system. We should have trusted it - not them playing God
1	I had COVID about a month ago. It was super mild for me. But I’m double vaxed and boosted.
0	Me when i get the covid vaccine: Autism^2
0	However I did not get any covid Vax. I have 4 friends who suffered very serious adverse reactions to the vaccine. One is in a wheelchair now.
0	The doctor said the potential downsides to vaccines are almost non existent. Has he looked at  150 side effects listed on the vaccine insert including anaphylaxis.
0	Do research. More unvaccinated deaths than vaccinated. It also isn't he vaccines. Its diseases that can't be vaccinated like cancer the buffoon
1	I got vaccinated to do my part against COVID
0	Studying vaccine development prior to the COVID outbreak gave me all the information I needed to refuse the new vaccines.  Best decision I ever made
0	Patient: Doctor, will this vaccine give me immunity.Doctor: No, it gives the pharmaceutical companies immunity.
0	3 jabs of an mRNA vaccine in one year with no long term safety data is insane. Why can no one see this?
1	Got my booster vacine a week ago, had a little fever no other problems.. yet no covid infection since my 1st pfizer shot.
0	I havent had covid since 2021. Im unvaccinated and yet, all these vaccinated people I work with. Are catching covid yearly, sometimes 2 or 3 times a year.
1	My youngest has a bunch of health issues. I always vaccinated before, but wasn’t big on getting the flu vaccine and whatnot. Now we do. We do what we can to protect the 2 year old who lives in our house because maybe she won’t survive what a normal healthy kid would.
1	In Turkey vaccines are mandatory. I've never seen someone saying that they don't trust vaccines.
1	IT IS TRUE that most vaccines are useful in preventing disease, a very big mistake was made by the W.H.O when they pushed the covid jab on to the world's population it will put vaccination back 50 years. Scientists, pharma and ( The elite involved in this covid fiasco ) need to be sacked fined and exposed.
0	Let's play an Old-Tyme GAME known as the "Nuremberg Necktie" from the post-WWII Era. Vanna, I would like to buy a 'V' as in Vaccine.
0	I TOLD YOU IT WAS NEVER ABOUT THE VIRUS. IT WAS ABOUT THE VACCINE. Pretty obvious now
0	My mom had two brain aneurisms after her shots and died soon after !!!
1	He passed away so I hope other anti-vaxxers get the message he was belatedly trying to convey.
1	QUESTION: I take the Covaxin (the vaccine that is being distributed in India) I take every other vaccine I need, my body develops resistance against each of these potential diseases. But, since I've gained so much immunity, are there any kinds of side effects of this immunity? Like, I have so much immunity, can it be bad to my body in any way?
1	Ah, so that's why Japan is the healthiest,has the lowest rates of infant mortality AND highest life expectancy in the WORLD, and yet also has the lowest rates of vaccinations in the first world?
1	I have faith in the safety and efficacy of the vaccine.
1	It is great that this scientific innovation was awarded the Nobel prize in Physiology and Medicine in 2023
1	this jab boosts the anti bodies against covid
1	Initially hesitant, did research, talked to doctor, glad I got vaccinated.
1	I guess anything is worth a try at this point
0	By not taking the jab, I'm 100% safe from side effects and 99% safe from covid.
1	One small prick for a man - one giant prick for mankind!
0	100% safe from side effects, 99.98% safe from COVID death. I think I’ll stay unvaccinated. Let’s Go Brandon!
1	As a frontline worker, seeing the difference. Get the vaccine!
1	Wrong again. What makes you think I am 100% against all vaccines? I am not against vaccines for polio, measles etc. so how do I fit into your narrowminded egotistical rhetoric? How does that make me a so called “anti-VAX”  Don’t you see what enables you to jump to conclusions and generalize an entire group of people? It’s not complicated it’s simply belief reinforced by ego. What do you think telling other people what they can do with their freedom is reinforcing in you? Your ego. Who are you to tell people what they can and cannot do with their freedom?   You want to live in a free country yet if people make choices that you don’t agree with then suddenly that’s not OK. Their freedoms should be taken away from them. This is not what freedom is about. This is clearly rooted in ego and the belief that you “know better” then they do. And that it’s your position to dictate to them but who the fuck are you to do that? Oh that’s right there’s the massive ego again reinforcing the belief that you are the person deemed to dictate to them. So called anti-VAX are the least of your problems dude
1	Yes, of course you should get the vaccine. Not to do so is extremely irresponsible.
0	I’m not anti vaccine I’m pro common sense!
0	COVID Shots Are Officially Deadliest Drug In History and Nobody Is Allowed to Talk About It
1	The end is nearly here. I hope everyone is able to stay safe and be as healthy as possible.
1	My dog seems to behave better after I took the vaccine. Do they feel some pheromones through us maybe getting stronger? Anyhows it works and I feel good.
0	Did you know more people died of the vaccine than Covid?
0	How to trigger people: Tell them you didn’t get vaccinated LOL
1	Just Recieved the Covid Vaccine! First step on the road to getting back to some normality!
1	If your against the Vax you should be given bottom priority.
0	The Johnson & Johnson covid vaccine has been discontinued. Hmmmm. I wonder why.
1	I had a minor reaction to a regular flu shot, i don’t care if this covid shuts down my fucking kidneys. If it means I’ll forever be able to taste my coffee and pizza, wear lipstick again and if it means we can open borders so i can say goodbye to my now-passed grandpa and check on my grandma while i still can, I’ll fucking popclaw those vaccines. I miss him so much. We didn’t get to hold a service or anything, It feels wrong. He was such a good kind man and i can’t hug anything but his urn now. God let this be over, please let this be the start to it being over please
1	Thank you, scientists!
1	I envy the West. In my country the government couldn't secure enough vaccines due to how corrupt they are.
1	I got vaccinated and feel a sense of relief knowing I'm helping curb the spread.
0	Dear fellow purebloods. Stay strong
0	using a leaky vaccine (People still get and transmit it) during a pandemic puts massive evolutionary strain on the spike protein to evolve. This leads to breakthrough cases and new variants.
0	I believe that the immune system is best strengthened by natural exposure to pathogens.
1	Get vaccinated, for yourself, for your families, for your community, for your country, for the entire humanity.
0	Avoid the clot shot
1	Ignore them. The vaccine is safe. Unfortunately there are plenty of christian’s who are ignorant and anti-science. Just do what is right and get vaccinated
0	Natural immunity zones are there which receives highest Sun rays throughout the year plays a vital role in developing Threshold Immunity.
0	Happy and extremely relieved that I had healthy skepticism and did not yield to pressure and mandates and accept this poison.
0	I’m gonna keep it real even though nobody asked, I clocked out of COVID vaccines after the first two back in 2021
1	I hope everyone gets vaccinated. Stay safe
1	Everyone who wants to stay safe and keep their family and friends safe and protect their society and who can get the vaccine.
0	A friend had the vaccine and is now positive for delta variant Covid!!
1	Relieved and excited to receive the #COVID19Vaccine from #PfizerBioNTech.
0	NO THANKS!!! Keep your poison.
1	My mother is 98 years old. She has taken 4 shots and is just as healthy now as she was when she took the first shot.
0	My husband and I have had covid twice. As a cancer patient, I'm not in the best shape of my life and yet I flew through covid. We both did. It was little more than a cold. Unlike your brother though, we chose our immune systems to protect us, not vaccines or drugs.
0	A salute to the unvaccinated
1	Just got my second dose! Thankful for the medical advancements that allow us to move closer to ending this pandemic. Let's all do our part!
0	I said NO, to all of it and guess what, never got the covids!
1	Glad I got the AstraZeneca
1	Honestly, this vaccine rollout is impressive. Considering we're seeing numbers like 90% efficacy, we're in a much better spot than we hoped. Still gotta keep our guard up, but this is promising!
1	The tragedy is that innocent people are dying and not just these stupid twats.
1	I hope all antivaxxers and trumptards realize there covid and vaccine information comes straight from Russia
0	Words cannot express my hate towards these covid vaccs
1	You do realize that Covid is a dangerous disease that killed a lot of people, hospitalized millions and has left many with long-term damage, don’t you? And that the vaccine has proven & continues to prove, highly effective at keeping people out of hospitals and morgues.
1	Vaccine = No Covid =No Long Covid. Simple as that.
0	I heard the COVID vaccine turns people into zombies
1	How can you be this far into the pandemic and still not know that vaccination SLOWS the rate of infection? Holy FUCK are people ever ignorant, my God.
1	I got my second vaccine on Sunday (I'm almost 24 and will be student teaching in the fall) and while it completely knocked me out, I could not be more grateful that I got it. YAY SCIENCE!!!
1	“THe vACcInE dOeSn’T WoRk”
1	Here in Thailand, we barely have any vaccines, people are desperate to get vaccinated, and less that 10% of us are vaccinated. It feels very unfair that Americans just shoo it away when so many of us would have it in a heartbeat.
1	My best friend’s daughters got COVID as they are under 12 and haven’t been vaccinated. She, her husband and her mother are all vaccinated and have been getting tested every other day and they are all negative because the vaccine is PROTECTING them!!
0	I'll never get a boost for Covid again. After my 2nd boost I got eczema, which I haven't had since I was a child and since then, over 3 years now, the rashes never went away.
0	Im not getting that poison in me I haven't taken any type of vacs since I was 3 and never had any medicine since then too and I'm 100% healthy good
1	I got my shot without a second thought. If it's good enough for our health professionals, it's good enough for me.
1	The people who are dying in rich countries despite the vaccines being readily available are predominantly unvaccinated.
0	Ask labor and delivery nurses about the increase in old blood clots seen on the placentas in women covid vaccinated in their pregnancy.
1	100% against hospitalization and death.
1	Damn chill its not that deep. Take the jab and smile.
1	What all these deniers do not seem to realize is that they are a part of a community and have responsibility to that community to protect everyone from this disease. If everyone got the vaccine there would be no more Covid!
0	I have serious concerns about the vaccine
0	Almost all of the people I know who are 60 years and above who got COVID have had the lasting effect of fatigue and shortness of breath even after full vaccination and booster shots.
0	Those injections are dangerous and should not be given to anyone.
0	The fact that they’re trying THIS hard to convince people to get that shot should scare the hell out of all of you.
0	The vast increase of "Sudden Deaths" warn me away.
1	thnx to medicine and science we are having a better and long life
1	I want to contribute to herd immunity to protect those who can’t get vaccinated.
1	Good news, I hope they pin the recipe on Pinterest
0	I have so many friends that are unvaccinated , caught Covid and were fine . Also friends triple jabbed and got really sick from Covid
0	I'm healthy and young, so I'm not in a rush to get the vaccine
0	My in-laws take the shots because they’re normies and fall for everything the news tells them. Their cognitive abilities have degraded considerably. I feel sorry for them.
1	I had a crazy bad reaction to the MMR vaccine when I was a toddler. I still get all my vaccines. It's insane to me that people feel like it's some huge risk. It seems selfish to me 🤷♂️
1	I got my first Pfizer shot yesterday, I can feel my 5G powers coming in guys 🤣
1	Don’t give any vaccines to trump lover Republicans. Let them get. Less Republicans out there to vote
0	no thanks to the government injecting who-knows-what into my body?
1	Fear nothing. Just take the vaccine.
0	ug 16, 2022. A study of 1.25 million vaccinated individuals regardless under 65 the risk of an arterial blood clot, the kind that could cause a heart attack or ischemic stroke by blocking blood flow to the heart or brain, was nearly 22 times higher than in someone not vaccinated. For those 65 and older it was nearly 70% more likely overall to be diagnosed with Alzheimer's within a year of their infection, and 1,500 times more likely to have brain fog 1 year after infection researchers. And, a new study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that the latest version of the covid vaccine provides no benefit over the old booster for preventing infection. And its effectiveness significantly dropped off after 2 months.
1	The vaccine not only safeguards my health but also contributes to the safety of others. It's a selfless act.
0	" Proud to have resisted. Proud of my husband, my mother, and my family who protected their little ones. Sad that my father submitted due to the imposition of the nursing home where he was admitted... and to have lost him. In my memory, the acquaintances lost due to vaccination."
1	It takes a strong person to admit they were wrong on the vaccine. Weaponising the vaccine as a political tool representing 'oppression' etc. I wish everyone well and stay safe in this pandemic time!
0	I suffered an adverse reaction from dose 1 Pf, refused further doses under extreme pressure, and I was fired from healthcare job when my doctor would not sign my medical waiver. My greatest outcome is it scared my 25 yr old son who refused all doses thank God.
1	I am a Christian, fully vaccinated (first dose in March 2021, boosted in December 2021) - there is no vaccine that can touch my relationship with God.
1	Wish I could get the vaccine but my health condition won't allow it.
1	i wanna get the vaccine so bad but my parents won't let me, but i turn 18 in a month and i am fully ready to get vaccinated then
0	How about investigation into what he did with Federal covid relief money.
1	Yes, take any shot you can
0	vaccine mandates violate our freedom. it's a slippery slope to government control?
1	I'm a RN and I work at a hospital. I got the vaccine back in the beginning of the year, it's still not required at my job. I don't know if it should be but it makes sense that they would make it a requirement. I'm required to get the flu vaccine every year. I also have to maintain certain certifications and get a TB test otherwise face disciplinary action. When COVID hit I was also forced to be "redeployed" back to the inpatient units, I work in outpatient surgery, otherwise be fired and ineligible for rehire. I had to work directly with COVID positive patients. It was a very hard time for me. I didn't have a choice. So, needless to say, I'm not surprised a hospital would enforce such a policy, I work for one of the biggest Healthcare systems, you have to play by the rules, otherwise be unemployed..
1	Gimmee dat gud stuff boiiieeeee
1	Vaccines save lives, plain and simple
0	ALL VACCINES ARE POISON!!!
0	remember a time when 50 people died or had horrible side effects, The drug was removed from the trials. Ahhh the good old days when you could actually trust the science and medication.
0	I'm not going to be a lab rat! No shot for me ! Nice try
1	I'd figure that the more I put off vaccination, the faster virus mutates
0	Vaccines are a scam and it's obvious.
1	I trust the extensive research and dedication of scientists who have worked tirelessly to bring us the COVID-19 vaccine.
0	I regret getting it man.. I regret it
1	Encouraging everyone to do their part in ending the pandemic by getting vaccinated
0	Vax mandated nurse. I became paralyzed with transverse myelitis at C5, had 2 TIAs, developed a hemangioma in my vertebra and a fatty tumor in my heart. My lipid panel doubled within 3 months of my vax. I also developed allergies to foods I’ve always eaten and dysautonomia. The tinnitus and SFN have been horrific to deal with, too.
0	I had 2 AZ and my pharmacist recommend low dose of aspirin for 3 weeks after every jab. Unfortunately I trusted the Medicine that they were really trying to help, but now I don't. Now I question everything.
1	Please please PLEASE get vaccinated if you can and haven’t already, and if you aren’t do everything you need to in order to protect those around you.
1	I'm very glad I got it and I will happily get any boosters that come my way. I'm high risk, so being vaccinated means I can feel confident about getting back to the things I liked to do before the pandemic
1	Getting vaccinated is an act of love for our community.
0	Oyy veyyy not the clot shot
1	I’ll happily take a vaccine (I just got my flu shot like I do every year)
1	Just got my first dose this past Saturday, can't wait to get my second dose. One step closer to protecting my loved ones
0	I had a friend in England get her booster vaccine in Dec 2021 and ended up having a Mini Stroke. COuldn't talk or swallow for a week. She was in hospital for that time. She now has a  DO NOT GET BOOSTER note in her chart.
1	I'm getting my vaccine next week I'm so grateful to be getting it!!
0	Headline should read “We’re going to tell you what our sponsors and government officials that we work for want you to believe because it benefits them and us.”
1	After getting vaccinated, my body will develop immunity to that disease
0	So you were tricked into taking he vacinne. Instead you defend it by saying my symptons were not that strong. LOL
1	Trust in science and get vaccinated. It's our best chance at beating COVID-19. #TrustScience #BeatCOVID
0	No vaccine here
0	Sorry, you got the wrong target. These are not vaccines, they are just a huge business. And not only.
0	In Baton Rouge. How can you possibly know long-term effects? Is it true that most cells penetrated by vaccine mRNA will eventually be killed by, for example, killer T cells? Many of these killed cells are muscle cells. But, how many are lymph cells? Will the damage thereby done to the immune system diminish a body's ability to fight early stages of cancer? How can you know? Tell us?
0	I have no intention of taking an under tested vaccine produced with a new and untried technology. I do not need to, as having recovered from Covid19 I now have natural immunity.
0	I'm glad I trust my gut feeling, the pharma industry is absolutely evil. I have companies still denying me just because I'm unvaccinated, its crazy
0	What vaccine doesn't stop you getting the disease it's supposed to protect you from ?
1	Yes getting the vaccine for seasonal flu seems to lessen symptoms. I've had pneumonia before, obviously not COVID19 related, but it sucked and I would not wish that on anyone
1	Remember it's not just the deaths, it's the potentially worse outcomes of the disease. It's the permanent damage that covid could cause to bodies which is also significantly lowered by the vaccine.
1	"I got this vaccine, and in 4 weeks, I'll have the second dose... Excellent. Greetings."
0	IT'S NOT A VACCINE IT DESTROYS THE IMMUNE SYSTEM. BUT IY SURE PAID OUT FOR THE "WORLD WEALTH"  ORGANISATION!!!   "THE BROTHERHOOD" OH SORRY I MEANT THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANISATION..OOPS !!!  IN THE UK £1000.00 PER JAB WAS GIVEN TO EACH ADMINISTRATOR PER JAB GIVEN!!
0	Nobody regrets not getting the jab.
0	It's the long term affects that worries me.
1	We are in the 2nd year of Covid-19 and the Govt. still thinks that curfews & lockdowns are the way to resolve this! Testing and vaccination are the only way ahead… …and maybe not holding political rallies too!
0	I've had it twice. Once on 2019 and then 2021. Not vaxed , no hospitals, no drugs. Just my immune system and I'm 67. Now tell me what??? No way.....
1	These people will drink bleach if someone tells them to https://arstechnica.com/health/2023/10/florida-men-sentenced-to-years-in-prison-for-selling-bleach-as-miracle-cure/Anti-vaxxers aren’t anti-science because that would imply they understand science. They’re anti-knowledge and anti-reason which is far more dangerous
1	That second paragraph gave me hope for humanity.
1	Happy to report I'm vaccinated. Protecting myself and others feels greatv
1	Vaccination is the key to ending this pandemic. Let's all do our part! #VaccinesWork #PandemicSolution
1	Anti-vaxxers should be refused all medical help whatsoever. No medicines. No surgeries. NOTHING. Let nature take over so Republicans have a maximum of a 40 y lifespan.
1	I'm about sixty-four years out from my polio and measles vaccinations. I've still had no ill effects from them, so we have no doubts about the long-term safety and efficacy of vaccinations. I had both chicken pox and mumps, because vaccinations for them didn't exist. I can tell you how it felt to have each of them. I had fevers with both. Mumps was so painful! I'm glad people don't have to suffer through mumps and chicken pox any more. Some children were very sick from them. I got the shingles vaccination when I was eligible, and then when the two-injection vaccination for shingles came out, I took medical advice and got those injections also. I can't remember how long I've gotten flu vaccinations, and I got the latest flu vaccine a couple of weeks ago. I got my fourth COVID vaccination at the same time. I've never had polio, measles, shingles, or COVID. Vaccines work, and they are safe.
0	Testing new vaccines with microchips. This is a fact jack!
1	The Covid vaccines are now among the most tested and used medicines on planet earth.  BILLIONS of people have used them. Any significant risk would be affecting millions of people. Even in this country, like 200 million people have taken it, and if you include boosters we’re talking nearly a billion shots. If only 0.01% of people had a side effect, it would develop in hundreds of thousands of people. You would know if 200,000 people developed blood clots from the vaccine.
0	This was a coworker. He went to a Christmas party with 5 other people and they all got the 'Rona except him. He is unvaccinated.
0	So glad it's been mandated.for 5 year olds who are basically immune to Covid anyway…
0	They started forcing people to take the vaccine threatening them with their jobs if they didn’t get the vaccine and it only had about a year of history and testing before they started pushing it out, my job told me I couldn’t work unless I got the vaccine, I quit that job before my boss could finish that sentence
0	Biggest mistake of my life was taking the shot to get my wife out of lockdown. 2 years later and I still have heart problems and thrombosis in my legs. F the entire medical mafia.
0	Let's be honest; most doctors knew this vaccine was dangerous a couple of years ago. Doctors need to begin speaking out. Better late than never.
1	I got my 2nd Dose from Pfizer/ BioNTech vaccine yesterday, Btw, I am working in Germany as a nurse. I had my side effects but i can live with it.
0	After my second Pfizer shot I had. 105.2 fever and convulsions… then pneumonia for 2 weeks… the doctors wanted me to keep my mouth shut
1	Anti vax nuts can get pissy at this all they want but they’re making their choice, isn’t that what they want?
1	Furthermore, vaccinated people have a lower viral load, so even if they are infected, they are still less likely to spread it.
1	My kids are vaccinated dipshit. I just choose to educate myself further since doctors aren't always right unfortunately. Medical error is the number 3 leading cause of death in the US. Remember when cigarettes didn't cause cancer? DDT was safe? Asbestos was safe? It's up to you to properly educate yourself to protect yourself from malpractice.
0	i’m unvaccinated against COVID and i honestly am so happy i never got it
1	I had my daughter in Dec 2020. The minute vaccines were available for her age group, I got her vaccinated. If it had been available when she was 6 months, I’d have gotten it for her then. Sometimes babies go through it fine, and sometimes they get very sick, and (luckily rarely), they die. If the worst happened and I could have prevented it with something as simple and accessible as a shot, I could never live with myself. That’s what I decided for myself and my family. I get that other people look at the stats and feel fine with their kids odds of a bad infection.
1	About 30.3 per cent of people in aged care have received a booster shot in the last six months, more should follow
1	I've never been more grateful for modern medicine than when I got my COVID-19 vaccine
0	Covid vaccines= depopulation
0	The amount of relief I feel that I didn't get vaccinated, even though I was pressured by almost every member of my family, is absolutely indescribable! I feel sorry for those who got it though.
1	I just got my first Pfizer shot and as I'm sitting here with a slightly sore arm (utterly normal), I am enjoying understanding what is happening in my body as I type this comment.
1	They are as close to a "you will not die" shot as there is.
0	I'm a tree hugging hippy. I believed the Moderna vaccine would help all of us. I am now on disability...im one of the few who ""never"" had autoimmune disease whom now has autoimmune disease. I have 12 different Dr's now. Before 4/21 I  had one Dr. That I seen once a year. Now I at the Dr's office atleast 3x a month. I want to say thank you for your honesty and knowledge.
0	In teens and young adults ??????? Try , EVERYONE .....WAKE UP PEOPLE
0	LIES AND MORE LIES
0	Imagine still thinking this literal poison is good for you.
0	Why is Vaugh wearing a facemask? He is the only one standing there..thats not for safety, that's just to show oh look at me I support the restrictions.
0	The longer this has gone on, the more relieved I am that I never got the jab.
0	Not a single vaccine works!
1	I'm a nurse and i work in ER why is everybidy scared about the vaccine, yes it forms a clot but that dissolves automatically! there is nothing to be scared of
1	I have my own theory about antivaxers.  They are scared of needles
0	This is misinformation, the vaccine is not safe nor is it effective
1	I think vaccine can help us to end this mess.
1	Get boosted. Is only effective plan at this point. 70-80% instead of 30-40. Key point is ICU loads and overwhelming the medical system.
0	My neighbor Tony died on July 19th, 2021, a week after receiving his first shot of the vaccine. A blood clot developed in his stomach and it burst, leading him to bleed out and die before getting to the hospital. He was deathly afraid of getting the vaccine but his doctor insisted. There was no autopsy or investigation into why he suddenly died because his greedy daughter had him cremated ASAP so she could collect on the insurance policy and sell his house for cash. I still remember the conversation he had before getting the shot; how nervous and fearful he was that something bad was going to happen. He was otherwise healthy with no issues or conditions. From that point on I decided not to get vaccinated and I'm glad I didn't.
0	Don't listen to those people don't get the shots is a whole reset guys I lost five friends already they are murderers and I have my best friend's sick all the time from the shot
1	Just got my 4th booster. Don't be a pussy.
0	Wow. They literally just layed it out. Stay strong with the Lord
1	You would be amazed at the Covid studies coming out.  Will you make the time to actually study or will you just assume everything is cool?
0	Biggest mistake of my life was taking the shot to get my wife out of lockdown. 2 years later and I still have heart problems and thrombosis in my legs. F the entire medical mafia.
0	With this rushed testing timeline how can we be sure there's no long term side effects?
1	I’m pacu too. We were floated to Covid units. We saw the deaths. I don’t know how some nurses are anti vax after seeing/experiencing that. My employer requires vaccination for Covid. Nurses that refused were laid off. They’re still not allowed back to work there.
1	Movie nights without masks,a victory worth celebrating
1	Have had the  four, also had Covid and the antivirals.  Heavy cough which is still not totally gone after two months.  But, firmly believe that I would have been much sicker without the vaccine.  I believe we need to take advantage of every bit of medical advancement we can.
0	You mean the billions of people who died from the vaccine right? My friend's cousin worked with over a dozen people who died from the vaccine but the media refuses to report on it.
0	Hope its works for them. I'll pass on the vaccine.
0	My in-laws take the shots because they’re normies and fall for everything the news tells them. Their cognitive abilities have degraded considerably. I feel sorry for them.
1	MRNA turns your body into a spike protein factory and doesn't let up.
0	I’m really mind blown how the black community is willing to just take this knowing Americans history with “free” shots
1	The collective effort in vaccine development and distribution is inspiring.
1	I had a heart attack at the peak of covid in January. I was alone in ER for hours. I was not allowed to see the priest but I survived. I got the moderna shots when I was eligible. I had few side effects. If a heart attack survivor can get the shots, others can get it.
0	Shout out to the fully unvaccinated,  we weren't sheep, and have no side effects , to everyone else r.i.p😅
1	Vaccines are our best bet to avoid future waves and spikes in cases.
0	Me and my parents are unvaccinated and still here completely healthy.
0	This aged so well. Even my elderly parents are like “no more vaccines”. They blew all the belief in the medical establishment in 2 years…
1	I'd also add that it's important to keep your vaccinations updated - some of them wear off after a period of time, after which you need to get the shots again.
0	You can not hold the pharmaceutical manufacturer liable for any damages or side effects . But if your employer insist that you get the shot and there’s a side effect you can hold him liable. My question is if the government forces you to take the shot and there’s a side effect can you hold them liable?
1	"As a healthcare worker, I've seen the devastating effects of the virus. Vaccination is our best weapon against it."
1	I’m myself fiercely pro-vaccination also holding the view individuals have a right to their own medical privacy.
0	the first covid vaccine I got gave me heart palpitations, no thanks.
1	I got the vaccine in January/February of 2021. I have not regretted my decision for a single moment.
1	Educating myself on the vaccine's benefits made my decision clear.
1	Project warp speed was a definite success!
1	The amount of anti-vaxxers in this comment section is making me lose even more faith in humanity.
1	A soccer mom telling a pediatrician that he's wrong.  Confidence: 9000
1	The single time being an essential worker was a benefit. I got mine somewhat early
1	I just became a father for the first time and have become Ulta Consius of the horrible trend to not vaccinate children
1	Join the vaccination gang.
1	You want to work in the health care industry, maybe you should trust the health care experts. Your choice, get vaxed or go work somewhere else.
1	This vaccine saved me from death
1	You just convinced me to not be picky about vaccines. Thank You!
1	Please have your vaccines - & no more conspiracy theories.
0	Ive seen firsthand how damaging pharmaceuticals can be. I'm not going to blindly follow orders and inject something into my body without thorough research
1	Yes. Vaccinated people are more healthier than non-vaccinated people.
0	Yeah, heart attack like symptoms,after the 1st shot, nerve issues after the 2nd. 14 months of feeling poisoned, something is very wrong with this medical product. 🇨🇦
0	Get the shots if you want but please DO NOT mandate them for every person.
0	I'm scared to get vaccine, everyone has different reactions
1	Hell yeah and I’m gonna get the new ones coming out too. I have an autoimmune disease (thankfully not to the point I can’t have vaccines) and when I caught COVID, I really thought I’d have to go to the hospital for a week. I managed to pull through, but I’m not sure I would’ve if not for the vaccine lessening the blow to my immune system
0	You may die from myocarditis - this is normal, don't be concerned. You may develop an auto-immune disorder - once again, this is a normal side-effect.
1	Got vaccine today #CovishieldVaccine #Supportvaccine
1	The side effects are a result of your immune system releasing cytokines in response to the vaccine. There have been several studies showing that the side effects are a good thing, indicating a better immune response and longer lasting antibodies.
0	No more shots for me
0	Republicans still coping that they wasted 2 years fighting a fictional enemy
1	I'm encouraged by the increasing number of people getting vaccinated
1	sometimes when I hear conservative people's conspiracy theories my brain just windows closing sound
0	You mean the MRNA vax that’s killing and maiming millions
0	I had so many family members try to tell me that I was reason that COVID persisted because of not getting vaccinated. They are not saying that now.
1	I trust in the doctors and medical experts who have recommended vaccines
0	The FDA suppresses medicinal and natural cures,and of what it does approve about a third of the amount are eventually found out to be injurious/poisonous.The current director had a huge part in approving both oxycontin and fentanyl
0	Shoutout to the smart ones who didn’t take any Covid shots
0	I believe in building immunity naturally, not through vaccines. #NaturalImmunity #NoToVaccines
1	66% is better then 0% that major or whatever is tripping
1	The most important reason to stay up-to-date on coronavirus vaccines (and the flu vaccine and RSV vaccine, for that matter) is to reduce your risk of hospitalization and death.
1	I'm looking forward to a future where we can gather safely, and getting vaccinated is the key step toward that future.
0	Doesn't matter I'm not getting any of them, haven't gotten any of them still alive
1	After a life of being nobody, the validation makes them feel they're somebody, it becomes an addiction.
0	1. Don’t take it 2. Don’t take it 3. Don’t take it
0	Did this study identify those people with Long Covid who experienced a worsening of the condition after the vaccine? I'm at 17 months of LC and the vaccines affected the symptoms negatively.
0	Unvaxed proud and healthy
0	As soon as it’s proven safe with longer-term trials, I’d be perfectly happy to take it, but with the long-term side effects being so unknown, I’d say no to it.
0	When will people understand that you are currently in a clinical trial.
0	It’s so stupid how the new variant just “coincidentally” appeared during the holidays
0	Conveniently, all vaccines are safe and holy. Like no other man made things, this one is just perfect, fit and efficient without side effects too.  Right.
1	Covid-19 vaccine saves lives, and I urge all of us to continue our plans to get vaccinated as soon as possible.
0	Me watching this totally fine and unvaccinated. Gotta love the sheep.
1	Pfully pfizered and pfeel pfantastic
0	Let's be honest;  most doctors knew this vaccine was dangerous a couple of years ago.   Doctors need to begin speaking out.  Better late than never.
1	It’s actually disturbing how much antivaxx rhetoric is now a part of the mainstream and now people think the vaccines are something to avoid…
0	Sadly I took 2 doses..I regret , I don't feel anything but who knows. I will keep praying to Lord keep me safe and intact from any negative impact
1	Seeing everyone get vaccinated is so uplifting. We're in this together!
1	That newfound mRNA way to create a vaccine, salute for the scientist!
1	This is how I drive bike after getting vaccinated  #jabbed #Covaxin #vaccination #vaccinated #COVIDVaccination
1	Post Acute Sequelae of COVID. Anti-vax contingent is going to have a nasty wake-up call.
1	Hey y'all I cried when I got the vaccine because I'm a big crybaby that's is still scared of needle's (they used the baby needle too)
0	Goodluck to all ... I hope it won't be mandatory, don't know the long term side effects till about 3 or more years.
0	If you like being sick, and are tired of being alive, keep getting boosted.
1	The COVID-19 vaccination does not reach the cell nucleus, where DNA is stored, or interact with human DNA within cells.
0	How about intern him up with Covid-19 positive patients for a month or two, refill the releases with newly diagnosed people but let him remain in that vacation from vaccination joint and wait patiently! I`d be very exited how he might possibly change his mind and words should he be infected and becomes Covid-19 positive!
0	Awesome ! I hope more freedom loving states do this. Each ban will make Klaus Schwab cry
1	I got the AZ. I got side effects on the first doze. 8 weeks later I got my second doze without any side effects. So far so good
0	My Dad was 58, never smoked, never drank alcohol, had a physical job and a great diet. On the 3rd of January I found him dead in his bed. Cause of Death has been put down to heart failure which doesn’t make any sense to me at all. If I could go back in time and stop him from getting those Vaccines + Boosters then I would. I feel so much guilt.
1	What is the best news a daughter can get at the end of 2020? That the Moderna vaccine is coming to her 85/90 yr old parents’ retirement community and they are in line. Hallelujah!
0	Nah, man. Vaccines are just a scam to distract us from the real issues, like climate change and avocado toast prices.
0	It's not a vaccine. it's a dangerous gene therapy.
0	the first covid vaccine I got gave me heart palpitations, no thanks.
0	Always Love your information educating those who are prepared to listen and learn is so important. We must all try to spread the word on the biggest lie every told when it comes to our health
0	Hue hue hue hue hue hue hue Never again
0	Not convinced the vaccine is the best solution for me personally
0	How do you explain all Israelis vaccinated & got sick with the Delta variant????
0	I ain’t vaccinated and will not be vaccinated!!!
1	It's discouraging that so many are failing to use simple protective measures.
0	Hey Vaxxers! Keep telling yourselves whatever makes you feel good about the drugs that you were duped into getting, and be sure to enjoy whatever it is that you believe that you get out of having them in your bodies. Meanwhile, those of us that won't be participating are all doing just fine with zero issues or regrets, and everyone knows it too.
0	poison
0	Really? Pretty bold statement.18 months with barely any clinical trials to support that claim.
0	Nurses in Queensland who were stood down during the pandemic for refusing to get a Covid vaccine are being sacked despite the lifting of mandates.
0	I read somewhere that vaccines contain aborted fetal tissue.
0	Have fun, guinea pigs!
1	When I had the vaccine for 3 days my body felt a bit sore not really sick but it felt good!
1	The professionals having to deal with kids or people ending up in ICU from preventable diseases are the BEST spokespeople for why vaccines are essential.
1	Woot! Definitely gonna be up to date this year with my vaccinations. There is just no point in risking it and I work retail. I may be the immune shield for an immunocompromised, infant, or elderly person.
1	I am from Bangladesh, which is a third world country. Before WHO and the government stepped in, hundreds of kids used to die from preventable diseases like measles, small pox etc. My own cousin died from small pox at age of 2 because she didn't receive the vaccine on time. Hearing people in the 1st world country saying vaccines are harmful makes me really sad and angry at the same time.
1	Blaming vaccines because your child had a negative reaction to them is like blaming cheese for being lactose intolerant. It’s nobody’s fault. It’s the luck of the draw.
0	Because it’s not a vaccine (even though it’s branded as one). It’s an experimental gene therapy that requires 3+ shots a year
1	All my shots were boubon. Apparently they worked, I'm still healthy.
1	This is totally a best approach to explain a issue in the appropriate matter .  Our survival  depends on    science . Logic and clarity . Will prevail .
1	I received the vaccine to contribute to herd immunity and keep vulnerable people safe
0	All of the anti-vaxxers out there I've got one message for all of you I salute you keep up the good work
0	i’m unvaccinated against COVID and i honestly am so happy i never got it
1	i have asthma, and i’m really concerned that if i got the virus before being vaccinated, i would get seriously hurt. i was of the first people in line as soon as i could get it, because as much as i hate myself, i would prefer not to die like that.
0	Again quit posting this garbage on my Facebook wall I have blocked you over and over I am not interested in any covid vaccine never will be stop posting this on my wall!
0	LINE UP SHEEPLE 💉🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑☠️
0	This is just a step for people to actually take the mark of the beast
1	It's safe. It's effective. Get it as soon as you're eligible. Do your part. #COVID19Vaccine #CovidVaccine
1	Guys the reason this study is important is because covid vaccines used revolutionary technology, they were the first to use mRNA based protein. If you remember we sequenced its genome within 40 days the making the vaccine was considerably easy. This is the main reason it took only 2 years for the vaccine to be made compared to years of development for other vaccines.
1	As someone who had covid last year and just got vaccinated, trust me, the vaccine side effects are WAY less painful than actually having it.
0	This documentary sickened me to my core. And further convinced me that I would never take it. Well done to Nazarin for standing up for herself.
0	Think for yourselves.  They keep trying to spread fear if you don't comply.
0	"The vaccine rollout has been too rushed; I'd rather wait for more data on its long-term safety."
1	"Winning an argument against a smart person is hard. Winning an argument against a stupid person is impossible."
1	I got the covid vaccine! Got confirmed antibody test yesterday. So glad to be a part of science!
1	As someone who had covid last year and just got vaccinated, trust me, the vaccine side effects are WAY less painful than actually having it.
1	Fuck anti-vaxxers
0	he more people get side effects from the vaccine, the more clients will get created for the Big Medicine Industry
0	concerned about the long-term effects of these experimental drugs. We just don't know enough yet
1	Grateful to have been on the other side of the table as my newly 12 year old received his 1st COVID vaccination today. Thank you @NHSGGC  staff at Alexandria Community Centre and everyone vaccinating before the bells 🔔👏🏽💉what a team 😍
0	Vax propaganda disguised as being concerned for the public's safety & health. Classic!
1	Getting vaccinated is an act of love and responsibility towards our communities.
0	The risk-benefit imbalance substantiated by the evidence to date contraindicates further booster injections and suggests that, at a minimum, the mRNA injections should be removed from the childhood immunization program until proper safety and toxicological studies are conducted.
1	I'm fully vaccinated ! Got mine and the flu shot last week.
0	Why don't people talk about how this covid vaccination causes a lot of pain on the arm, or is it just me?
0	Everyone should boycott the heart foundation. This charity is supported by the British public. Seems the Heart Foundation is definitely not telling us the truth regarding the data. What's the point of these organisations if they are only bothered about politics and money. They are not interested in our health, disgusting.
1	Vaccines have allowed us to prevent diseases that used to cause widespread suffering and death.
1	The problem is that there’s people who have been vaccinated who aren’t getting care because of the influx of idiots
1	It sucks, but knowing this will be their legacy seems to be the only thing that gets some people to vaccinate.
0	Vaccines are used for population control.
1	I got my Pfizer jab yesterday!
1	They are necessary so you don't have outbreaks that could become an epidemic.
1	There is now enough Covid 19 vaccine in Canada for every single citizen. If you have not already done so, go out and get vaccinated folks. The life you save by doing so may just be mine. Join the 80% of Canadians who have already stepped up for their country. Cheers
1	They most definitely do. Ask your doctor what’s in the vaccine and find out for yourself. But if you don’t believe that what about Aluminum? It’s  is just one of the harmful neurotoxins that they use but there are countless more. This is just the tip of the iceberg.   https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/21568886/  It clearly states: Aluminum is an experimentally demonstrated neurotoxin and the most commonly used vaccine adjuvant. Despite almost 90 years of widespread use of aluminum adjuvants, medical science's understanding about their mechanisms of action is still remarkably poor. There is also a concerning scarcity of data on toxicology and pharmacokinetics of these compounds. In spite of this, the notion that aluminum in vaccines is safe appears to be widely accepted. Experimental research, however, clearly shows that aluminum adjuvants have a potential to induce serious immunological disorders in humans. In particular, aluminum in adjuvant form carries a risk for autoimmunity, long-term brain inflammation and associated neurological complications and may thus have profound and widespread adverse health consequences. In our opinion, the possibility that vaccine benefits may have been overrated and the risk of potential adverse effects underestimated, has not been rigorously evaluated in the medical and scientific community.
0	It should alarm you that we are headed toward a society where you will have to offer up unlimited access to your veins in exchange for permission to live a normal life.
0	HE vAcCiNEs hAVe bEeN TeStED riGOrOusLY’  yet she somehow failed to mention that the resultant published data had been massaged rigorously. ‘$CIENCE!’️
1	Thank goodness my entire family took this special vaccine, just a bit of soreness, but it's all worth it to feel way much better!!!!
0	NO THANKS.
0	I have Myocardises after getting my MRNA. Just waiting now for a law firm to start a class action. They lied to us.
0	We all know it’s the Jabby. And these evil people push for it still… crazy
0	Lol, no. I bet 99% of people here are under 40 without any comorbidities. There's no point in injecting yourself  I'm sure the downvotes will pour in. Enjoy making Pfizer richer
1	Vaccines save lives , Period !
0	I'm just over 50 unjabbed and no way on earth am I ever having this crap injected in me....
0	But people already told me that Pfizer admitted that it causes hearth problems!
0	So glad my family and I held off the jab and waited for the data.... Really feel for those who succumbed to peer pressure and took it…
0	Every single Covid Vaccine is poison .
0	I got sick 🤢 3 times one from the second 🥈 vaccine 💉 and from double ⏫ booster shot Blessings and Hugs 💜💜💜💜💜💜
1	Deleted guy isn't coming back because he doesn't have a side of the story. He doesn't believe in phase 3 trials, and doesn't believe the data that millions of people have been vaccinated with all side effects being nothing more than normal background noise.  Deleted guy doesn't believe, or doesn't understand statistics either, because he believes getting COVID is safer than risking side effects with the vaccine (almost all side effects are diminished reactions to the actual virus, which would likely be worse/permanent if not more fatal if you actually caught COVID unvaccinated.)
0	I dont trust it or those that would use it to enrich themselves while at the same time bankrupting society through lockdowns.
1	Got the vaccine because it's the right thing to do.
0	I’ve never been so grateful for being a critical thinker and I’m at peace as an unvaccinated person. Most of my family unvaccinated and so grateful for that.
0	the best time to get the vaccine is never goofy
0	These vaccines should not be mandatory or forced since each person has a unique set of issues they are dealing with. They affect each person differently. They should not be losing their job because of it.
1	If you've taken the jab, I salute you!
1	Freedom to die an extremely slow painful death where u fight for air and every second feels like an eternity. I haven’t had COVID but have had asthma attacks and it was the most terrifying thing I have ever been through. Just remember COVID can be worse.
0	"Millions of people were subjected to panic!"
0	You got that backward: COVID can give you heart problems: the vaccine, not so much…
1	Extremely unlikely (that's epidemiology-speak for never) the vaccine would produce any side effect worse than the actual disease which if you don't vaccinate, will eventually contract. (at a population statistics level)
1	If you get the real thing and fight it off, you build antibodies for it.
0	No thanks! And those that are getting their babies vaxxed….shame, shame, shame on you. Obviously the weakest of minds and easily brainwashed…
1	Philly has not been getting the recognition it deserves in biotech, so here are four Recent Massive Biotechnology Advancements Made In Philadelphia: 1. mRNA vaccines 2. EXTEND Human Womb 3. Curing Genetic Deafness 4. Growing functional human organs
0	This is a new virus that our bodies have never encountered before, and we have no vaccine. The death rate is higher than seasonal
1	I already got vaccinated 3 times, and I still caught the virus and believe me, it aren’t easy to recover nor endure… currently I am in my 3rd day and yesterday was far worse to the point where I couldn’t get out of bed and could only wait until my fever dropped from 39.5 degree to 38 before I could ever go take a shower from all that cold fever sweat. Overall I am glad I took the vaccine if not I would be suffering a more horrible backlash from this virus.
1	I got the booster yesterday and feel great! No side effects!
1	there is nothing to be scared ... i just got my 1 dose pfizor and it has been going great👍🏼
0	I never got vaccinated, neither did my brother. We both only Caught covid once . It was like a prolonged cold. That was it. My friends had the full vaccine box set, and has caught covid three times and has been out for the count every time. To be honest, I didn't avoid the vaccine because I was against it, not initially. I even booked myself in but got my dates wrong so I missed it. But after that, I started hearing bad stories from friends who had got it done. One of my friends said her whole side ached for a month. It was very uncomfortable, and her arm was numb for a week. My sister in law started getting rashes etc on her leg and other skin complaints. The Dr didn't even deny it was the vaccine. He just said, "Ah thats the vaccine for you"
1	This is awesome! Thank you! I can’t wait to get my shot!
0	Does that have something thatâ€™s not fully FDA approved is being forced and mandated upon people. In my opinion this sounds like a global science experiment being conducted for research.
1	Its weird being incredibly jealous and happy of all these people getting jabbed with needles. Keep up the good work!
1	That work, which didn't get much attention initially, has gone on to save countless lives 18 years later. The future is bright for vaccine research.
1	Long covid should always be part of these discussions. There’s evidence that getting vaccinated can reduce the severity of long-haul symptoms — critical information that’s rarely mentioned.
1	Remember, even if you dodge the vaccine and prevent harm from it, the danger from the disease is STILL THERE. You can still get the disease, and are at higher risk for complications. Meaning you have to cross the road of exposing yourself to risk at SOME POINT: the risk from vaccines, or the risk from the disease. I for one, would feel better choosing the probably less risky option and be done
0	Yeah if you pro vaxxers could tell me when these shots make me stop getting Covid, that’d be great!
1	The best way to prevent long covid is to stay vaccinated
0	i got covid at the beginning of 2020. I got the jhonson in May of 2021 and I just got covid now. 100% worse then the original covid.
0	My Son refused the vaccine from the very beginning
0	I’m a retired veterinarian. I could see from the start that mRNA had the potential to cause constant antigen production.
0	what’s the point in the vaccine??
1	I used to be a Covid denier back in March of 2020, and thought it was some lame new strain of flu. It wasn't until one of my idols (Rick May) and relatives died of it that I started to realize this is serious. I'm so ashamed that it took people I looked up to dying to take this seriously. It's my biggest regret in life, I wish people would just listen instead of trying to be so self-righteous. Please everyone, stay safe, and like a good life.Update: I've now gotten my 3rd shot, and am hoping to be able to get the 4th. Stay safe, friends.
0	Anxious about the vaccine side effects
1	good for you! get your boosters for covid - they work great
0	I never took the vaccine and I never had Covid
0	WHAT PEOPLE DO NOT UNDERSTAND IS, U GET THE VACCINE, U END UP GETTING WHATEVER VACCINE U GET!! MY FAMILY HAS NOT GOTTEN ANY VACCINES & WE DID NOT GET ANY THE DISEASES!!!
0	I don't think I can win by saying anything, whether it's reasonable or not.  There are soo many differences about this vaccine, And since everyone can't get their differences agreed upon, I will remain unvaccinated. That's one thing I can agree with.
0	And then let's talk about the high incidence of vaccine injury.....
0	The vaccine is dangerous. Thankfully I trusted my instincts and stayed away from that nightmare.
0	Arrest anyone giving it...
1	there are variety of vaccine consult doctor and use it.
1	since 2020, i expected to see a moment of realization among anti-vaxxers, covid deniers [et al] but then I realized it must be easier to live with lies and delusions, for it absolves them of any guilt, personal responsibility and indeed, humanity.
0	Mr. Pascal Najadi was vaccinated three times, but he now realizes that he was duped. He told the promoters of vaccination: "For those evil villains, it was a perfect genocide, perpetrated through the victims themselves.
1	I got vaccinated to do my part in helping society return to normal. The more people who get vaccinated, the faster we can get back to our pre-pandemic lives.
0	If you get the vaccine, you won’t get the disease PERIOD. Otherwise, people would’ve stopped getting the Tetanus shot if the majority of people still got tetanus after getting the vaccine. And, if you didn’t know, even Andrew Wakefield requested his name taken off the Wakefield study after the scientific community basically disowned him.
0	I had the first jab, and I wish I hadn't, total peer pressure and coercion after being made to lose time ten days off work due to being in contact, despite having clear tests. The side effects of that first jab made me realize just how bad a move it was. I've lost so much faith in humanity at how this whole thing was orchestrated
1	What happened to my body my choice
0	Not allowed to hold the company responsible if I have a reaction to it is all the reason I need to NOT take it
1	My grandparents are vaccinated now
0	Once you take it you can never go backwards and undo it. There's no do over. Stand firm always. ALWAYS.
0	When they're asking you to sign a paper that you cannot sue. Don't jab.
0	Imma be last in line to take it. Just chilling watching ya'll turn to zombies
0	the human body is amazing the way it fights for your health
0	This is criminal behavior.
1	dont spread negativity about vaccination
1	I had no side effects from either pfizer shots
1	My dad (whom I havent spoken to in years) is convinced that anyone who gets the mRNA vaccines is going to die in ~3 years. He called my sister raving about how she better not get the vaccine, its gonna kill her, etc. She told him that her and I already got the Pfizer vaccine and he hasn't spoken to her since. Good riddance?
1	What about them saying get the vaccine and you can go back to normal life
0	Had covid I was told at Christmas never had symptoms... Did a antibody test last week and I have natural anti bodies as I've never had the jab... Worked front line all the way through mainly without PPE.. So I'll let my immune system take over..
0	THANK GOD I DID NOT GET THE VACCINE
0	Sad people believe their health hasn’t been affected by the vaccine because they “are still alive” now
0	Why is he not talking about the possible deaths, cancers, infertility, auto-immune disease risk that his product poses over say five or ten years? Because the trial is being done now on the public. And of course they are immune from prosecution, so it's heads they win, tails you lose.
0	Poor people ,who have taken the posion.
0	Yikes! Clot shot
0	I hope you got safe and effective ASTRAZENICA vaccine which just got banned in Australia. Millions of people got this vaccine
0	I would like to thank my schizophrenia for not letting me take this poison.
1	I'm choosing to trust in the science behind vaccines, not the fear.
0	I dont want the vaccine because of the short time it took to develop. There have been a whole host of documented side effects and there hasnt been enough time to view the long term effects of such a hastily produced vaccine. As covid has not lived up to the "deadly" virus it was billed out to be, i will continue to treat it as any other contagious illness. I'll stay at home, not infecting other people, and remedy the old fashioned way.
1	I tested positive today in NJ. This shit sucks. I’ve had 6 shots. Good luck everyone this one’s a goodie.
0	None of them are side effects ! its doing exactly what they designed it to do . desired effects .
1	Well, I don’t know about your guy but I’ve had the most incredible erections and most intense orgasms since I got my second dose of the Moderna vaccine
0	I don't need to take the vaccine I take vitamins.
1	MP Kiambaa Koinange has succumbed to COVID-19. Guys, get protected. Get #AstraZeneca through the govt facility or book a COVID vaccine appointment and it's killing
0	As a nurse, I witnessed my coworkers have significant adverse effects and then be met with stone silence by the medical establishment. That was enough to make me not want to take it.
0	The vaccines are worse than the complaint.
1	Oh my  God, too amazing, congratulations to all hard workers for Vaccine formation...
0	I'm glad I trust my gut feeling, the pharma industry is absolutely evil. I have companies still denying me just because I'm unvaccinated, its crazy
1	Just give me the damn shot. Not like the planet has another 30 years left in it anyways. Covid is pale in comparison to the virus of humans.
1	The vaccine has been a beacon of hope in the midst of challenging times, inspiring me to remain resilient and optimistic.
1	Thank you for making this video! It's such a good way for me to start conversations with those in my life who are hesitant to get this vaccine. I am so relieved to be fully vaccinated and can't wait until enough people are that we can reclaim our communities again.
0	Never will I get it.. If I catch it and don't recover that's my own problem
1	Vaccines are a game-changer, keeping us and our communities safe. It's just the smart move.
0	The jab was more dangerous than the disease.
0	I’m not an anti-vaxxer or whatever you call it, but I just don’t know enough about this one, it’s so new and makes my anxiety sky rocket
1	I also was anti-vax. I was more the "I never got vaccines and I only had the chicken pox" type. I didn't ridicule others for getting it or stand real harsh about it. I planned to claim the religious exemption for my kids like my parents had done for my sister and I.  When my daughter got cancer  (pre-B ALL) it started to change. I had confidence in the chemotherapy but wouldn't allow vaccinations. As I started to think about it more it changed my viewpoint. I have gotten vaccinated for Covid and plan to get my children up to date with their vaccinations. I understand. ❤
1	Proud to be part of the vaccinated community.
0	I've heard about myocarditis cases following vaccination, especially in young people. What precautions are being recommended?
0	I'm anti convids1984 vaccine 100 % unvaccinated
0	Myocarditis is very mild, it only kills your child 5 years later.
1	Vaccination is a scientific achievement that should be celebrated.
1	Vaccines go through extensive testing before being approved for use. They're one of the safest medical interventions out there.
0	It shouldn’t be compulsory for anybody! Our body our choice!
1	This makes sense. You all should still get vaccinated regularly
0	Anti-Vaxxer here. I hate to say we told you so, but....well you know the rest lol
0	Safe and effective, tell that to the people who died or are disabled.
0	Vaccines are a money-making scheme for big pharma.
1	Thrilled to have just received the 2nd dose of #moderna #vaccine as IA category #healthcare.
1	was actually worried about the vaccine, but knowing they didn't cut corners makes me feel 100% better. Thank you so much for posting it, my family will absolutely vaccinate as soon as we can.
0	Shame on everyone who coerced or pressured people to take that shot.
1	Stick me! Stick me! Stick me!
0	I believe we should be very careful of these vaccines as people have died from them, or got very ill.
0	I did not want to take any jabs. but for family pushing i had 2 jabs not bad thankfully but find weight putting on if thats anything. i will not be having any more jabs _ Since giving up the flu jab i have had no colds no flu for 10 years. When i did have the flu jab i ended up on steroids and antibiotics. So i will follow what my body tells me. Im so glad you are here for the public And find you making it easy to follow You are a true doctor. so many are just follow what they are told thank you
1	A heartfelt thank you from the very depths of my soul to anyone who was involved, even in the smallest way, with the Covid vaccine. As I lay here sick in bed, at least I do not have to be terrified that this virus will possibly kill me…
1	I have no time to argue with stupid people. Vaccination is important and is not some government ploy with pharma companies... If my daughter gets sick because your bitch ass kid didn't get their vaccines while I go through the normal time frame. I'd probably sue the shit out of you.
1	My Husband and I, Both 68, took both vaccines and had no problem at all... I even helped on Valentine's Day at my daughter's flower shop. I had to get the second vaccine then.... I went right back to work and I never was sore or tired....
0	Who's here and are still unvaxed and proud??
1	It’s about trusting the experts who have dedicated their lives to medical science.
1	Delta almost killed me. If I hadn't been vaccinated I know I wouldn't be here.
0	I regret getting it man.. I regret it
1	Still, the mRNA ones offer double the protection against Delta compared to the others
1	I had the Pfizer vaccine in the UK 6 days ago and have an appointment for the second dose on the 12th of January. I then have to wait another week and then I’m covered
0	I regret the first two jabs.
1	Proven effectiveness, getting my jab ASAP for a safer tomorrow
0	I had my vaccine........ I never been so ill in my life........ don't think I will have another one......
0	Yooo, fear is the real virus. Fuck all these people guilt tripping you for using your common sense. Stand up for sovereignty!
0	More cons than pros with these vaccines
1	"I thank God for this salvation in the form of vaccines."
0	Aside from that poor woman collapsing. How in the world can the rest of the people in the room remain seated to await their vaxine that just caused someone to collapse? That is what is scary!
1	The decline of USA is home-made….social disintegration and marginalization of science….so sad.
0	So guys I did only one because the government force if you don't do you get fired from job. I did pfizef. I am to worry now.
1	Vaccines have wiped out diseases and saved millions of lives.
0	The risk of adverse reactions to vaccines, though rare, is concerning.
1	As a vaccinated 25 year old who has been married for just over a year now I have been harassed by friends and family members because I chose to get vaccinated and "we may want kids". Thank you for compiling all of this info. I'll be sending this everyone who decideds to "pray for me" because I've been vaccinated and "may want kids"
0	I love how this video says 3 companies used pork byproduct to make the vaccine then later it says none of the vaccines use animal products. Great reporting.
1	I try to get all vaccines I can but have had life threatening reactions to the mrna covid vaccine and some flu vaccines and cannot safely get them. I do agree that it's uncommon for doctors to try and force vaccines or deny a recorded severe reaction but it does happen more than it should.
1	I’m going to go out on a limb and say it; every person that I see in the ER with Covid could have prevented it by just getting the vaccine months ago. I don’t wish sickness on anyone, but they played a very poor hand that they dealt themselves.
0	it is safe coz i said so... seems legit
0	I am so sorry for those of us who took the vaccine! I've had so many issues with my breast since the Vaccine! Wish I had never taken it :(
1	Take that anti-science people... we'll use science to understand you! Muhahahaha!
1	Vaccination is a civic duty to protect public health and our communities.
0	So the Vax that DID NOT prevent you from getting or spreading the virus, whose efficacy faded in mere months, and which killed a lot of people
0	By not taking the shots I am 100% safe from adverse reactions and 99.98% safe from Covid
1	Just got my vaccine booster shot. Stay safe, everyone!
1	I'm literally going to america just to take that vaccine when it comes out lol
0	As an unvaccinated "tinfoil-hat wearing nutter", it's tough to watch people try and figure out what's happened to people and the world since 2020. And the worst is yet to come too.
1	Anti vaccination jokes will be funny for a longe time.   Unlike the kids that don't get them
1	Vaccines work, and thats about all that is proven.  Do vaccines work well? Do vaccines cause more harm than good? Do vaccines cause more harm than necessary? Are vaccines necessary at all? Should vaccines be forced? Should unvaccinated people be treated unfairy? Should unvaccinated people be seen as zombies? Do vaccines have safety testing, conflict of treatment testing (to check that two vaccines don't cancel eachother out or something)? Is Andrew Wakefield right? Do vaccines cause autism? Do vaccines cause death? How often? Do vaccines kill more people than they save?   These are just some of the questions that need to be answered, and aren't, or are answered with lies in face of truth.
0	I am happy I trusted my gut and didn't take it!
0	Did you know that " vaccines are unavoidably unsafe" and tax payers (not the vaccine maker) pay out $BILLIONS in compensation for vaccine injury every year.
1	So thankful to be fully vaccinated despite having an anaphylactic reaction after second dose. The pros of this are so worth it & my job depends on it
0	I've heard about side effects, and it's making me think twice
0	I am unvaccinated and don't have any regrets.
0	The only people I know have Covid are vaccinated
0	I had the first jab, and I wish I hadn't, total peer pressure and coercion after being made to lose time ten days off work due to being in contact, despite having clear tests. The side effects of that first jab made me realize just how bad a move it was. I've lost so much faith in humanity at how this whole thing was orchestrated.
0	I'm not willing to sacrifice my freedom for a rushed and untested vaccine. I'll take my chances with the virus instead
0	I don't trust anything anymore! If I get sick I will stay home and cure myself.
0	I'm so glad I stayed away from that weird sauce
0	I'm not gonna lie, I'm scared of needles AND this vaccine. Gonna wait it out.
0	Who would feel safe taking a vaccine from a country led by a brutal dictator, who has been poisoning people?? And the name, #SputnikV. Really?
0	I regret getting the vaccine as well.
1	Excited that staff are taking their vaccines so they can protect our kids and themselves. We need y’all!
0	I  am glad I watched this because it helped me realise that the shots are certainly unsafe.
1	Hope this changes the perception that vaccines are safe. They are not harmful.
0	I would rather die than taking that poison, which will ultimately kill me instead
0	I will not be taking it.
0	THANK GOD I DID NOT GET THE VACCINE
1	Vaccination is a crucial step towards normalcy. I got my shots, and I encourage everyone to do the same.
1	Strong believer that if you refuse the vaccination or storm hospitals to protest and then need hospital treatment for covid, you should be sent packing. #vaccination
0	who needs a vaccine when you've got those flintstone vitamin gummies from 10 years ago
0	THINGS I HONESTLY BELIEVE: Pfizer created Covid. Covid was just a rehearsal. The federal government weaponized it against us. The Covid GLOBAL pandemic was orchestrated by world leaders to steal our freedoms and redistribute wealth. The Covid vaccine did more harm than we know about. We don’t need China to develop a deadly virus, because we have Pfizer and Big Pharma labs right here in America. Fauci should go to prison for the rest of his life.
0	Am not a skeptic, am not hesitant, not an anti vaxxer either. Am an intelligent free thinking, free breathing adult who has researched the dangers of an experimental dangerous UNNECESSARY drug and decided I dont want to die.
1	antivaxxers: "there's a new vaccine out there. we don't know enough about it so we should avoid it" also antivaxxers: "there's a new virus around and we don't know much about it. oh well what's the worst that could happen?"
1	With both doses done, I feel safer and ready to hug loved ones again
1	Who would've thought that antivaxers would help me understand why I ended up isolating instead of going out and doing things some time ago... the omission seemed like a better option back then…
0	Until they drop a battle pass for Covid, I’m not dealing with this seasonal new variant BS. Worst game of Plague inc ever
0	Stop spreading lies! How can you say something is safe when it hasn't been tested properly!!!
1	1st dose in March, second in April. Have been exposed multiple times to COVID-19 and haven't developed an infection thanks to this. I will be getting the booster. For those writing immediately afterward with aches/pains: it was similar to when you get a F
1	Please get vaccinated and help save lives.
0	Nobody who refused the vaccine has regrets dude. However, some who took the vaccine do.
1	I'm 27. Just got my second dose yesterday, don't feel great but it's livable.
1	This is beautiful and inspiring. Shoutout to the doctors and staff that made the vaccine possible. I just got my first dose of the vaccine. Stay safe!
0	There is skepticism about the efficacy of vaccines, with some questioning whether they provide long-term immunity.
0	"It was never about 'immunization.' It was always the intention to label people to enjoy the services of a system, in addition to deteriorating health to become even more dependent on pharmaceuticals."
0	Not a single one of us regrets not getting the jab…NOT ONE.
1	I know there's been a lot of misinformation about COVID-19 vaccines, but I did my research and I'm confident that the benefits far outweigh the risks.
1	Oh dear, the intelligence or lack of it, once again shown by anti vaxers. I feel so sorry for them.
0	If it's so rare, then people should get some recompense when things go wrong.
1	It's like the flu shot. Doesn't guarantee you won't get it but for some it helps
1	"The vaccine is a crucial element in protecting our healthcare system from being overwhelmed."
1	There is no way anyone should get this vax unless they are old.
1	I GOT MINE! And it was really easy to do, very convenient, I drove my Dad, we made a day out of it, and the symptoms I felt weren't even that bad! I called out of work for the next day, took a long nap, and played video games and ate cereal all day! BEST Vaccine Ever!
0	I'm unvaccinated against Covid-19. I never socially distanced or wore a mask.
1	To the skeptics visiting this forum, the evidence is clear—the vaccine is effective.
0	Like our bodies cant make their anti bodies !!!?
0	No way in the world will I be getting that stuff put into my body.
1	It does reduce transmission it just doesn’t reduce it to 0%. Life is not so black and white.
0	One thing that puzzles and frustrates me is all the reports I'm reading of those of us being vaccinated and experiencing these effects, especially dizziness - but the vaccine manufacturers and those that have advisory oversight failing to update their lists to include it beyond the mention as a part of an immediate allergic response. I wonder - when 11 - 17% of those reporting have dizziness does that not at some point become considered a possible reaction? I hope that after so many are reporting these problems, especially as ongoing instead of fleeting, there will eventually be some acknowledgement and guidance given.
1	I'm in China and a lot of us children in schools AND the adults don't even have a chance
0	Best personal scenario:” Not Vaxxed” with Natural Immunity. Imagine how many people would have been saved just by just recommending vitamin D.
0	I pity all you vaccinated people.
1	Well the more people vaccinated the better and people like you are part of the reason that that number is so low besides we don't have complete herd immunity and never claimed to but if you can get sick from half the people you would normally get sick from that is two times as good as noone having vaccines and It is literally for your own good.
1	1st &2nd doses in March were fine, a little pain at injection site but not anything else. Still have very deep bruising and pain in leg at that site, but otherwise ok. Shot was given in upper left arm. I am 43, no underlying conditions and reasonably heal
0	Another dumb doctor. What is the risk-to-benefit ratio of taking an experimental synthetic gene treatment with zero long-term safety data? For a "virus" with an overall 0.034% infection-to-mortality rate.
0	MIT also just linked rising heart attacks to RNA vaccines
1	I got vaccinated to protect my friends,family and neighbors
0	Vaxine is stupid
0	All those stories about people getting sick post-vaccination are quite concerning.
1	Disclaimer: I’m NOT an anti-vaxxer
1	I got the booster yesterday and feel great! No side effects!
0	I personally know 11 people including family that died from COVID injections.
0	More cons than pros with these vaccines
1	I had the moderna one as part of the clinical trial in Sept/Oct. It's so awesome to see all the people starting to get these vaccines now that they are approved!
1	We're moments away from our 2 PM event with @Moderna_TX & @Sloan_Kettering. Tune in for insight into #Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine progress, booster shots, and expectations in regards to ending the global pandemic.
0	brand new vaccine technology + rushed development what could go wrong. YOU DONT HAVE TO HAVE A PHD TO BE A SKEPTIC
0	After the vaccine my dad's blood pressure increased and we watched him for 24 hours.  I realized that this elevated BP may cause hemorragic bleed in the brain..    Blood pressure must be properly monitored after vaccination.  My dad is alright now.
0	I'll stick with my immune system and 99.96% survival chance
0	A salute to the unvaccinated
1	My sister can’t be vaccinated because of her weak immune system, and I am proud to say I’m doing my part and getting my vaccinations to protect her and others like her. I only hope these people will stop thinking for themselves, listen to science, and get vaccinated. Frankly it’s very selfish, stupid, and ungrounded.
0	So thankful my family didn't fall for the jab.  Even my daughter with cancer, her Dr told her no vaccine
0	Not getting it☺️
0	Vaccine does not cure covid! Why even get it. Your immunity and wellness is the biggest gift. Take Care of yourself and you will be fine.
1	After 18 months of being in total lockdown with my wife we felt the vaccine gave us our lives back.
1	Just got my 6th Covid vaccine. I have a chronic illness and am immuno compromised so I will take these shots as long as they are offered to me and I'm grateful for them. Covid is NOT over. Be safe and vigilant! #covid19 #vaccine
1	My whole fam got the vaccine. No side effects, just relief and a bit of pride, honestly.
1	Real life data has proven that Pfizer, Moderna, Astra Zeneca & J&J are very similar in their effectiveness.
1	I have received all recommended vaccinations and recognise the importance of immunisation. I truly want to avoid contracting a complete coronavirus infection because it might have fatal consequences for your health as well as make you very sick.
0	I’m praying for a cure for #COVID19 rather than a vaccine. A cure would be administered only to the sick, while a rushed vaccine could unintentionally harm the sick AND the healthy
0	The lack of transparency surrounding the development and distribution of these vaccines raises significant ethical concerns for me.
1	First shot gotten, already have my second appointment planned
1	mRNA vaccines, such as Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, work differently than other types of vaccines, but they still trigger an immune response inside your body.
0	These adverse reactions are just getting worse and worse and worse (if that's possible). They must be PULLED immediately!
1	Still can’t get mine because I’m 23, meanwhile Linda from down the road is refusing hers because she’s “not a sheep”.
0	NOT A CHANCE. I will not take any vaccines
0	Funny thing is that if there was an experimental vaccine that would make you lose fat without dieting and exercising, anti-vaxxers would line up to take it without hesitation.
0	As someone who hasn't had ANY covid jabs I can say it's been very strange. I've never known so many people to have colds and flu! I haven't caught so much as a sniffle. The family that gave me a hard time about not having the jab aren't saying anything now.
1	The vaccine is our way back to normal. So grateful
1	You should play plague Inc in front of an anti vax parent.  Parent: What game is that? You: Plague Inc Parent: What happens in it? You: what happens if the world is anti vax
0	I didn't get vaccinated then and I definitely won't do it now. Great win for the American people
0	Vaccines and mask. 2 part weapon system. Pre packaged mask made in China and Mexico... vaccines to destroy immune systems... Spend all day breathing in a mask packaged in China, sprayed with a "preservative" for storage... Get respiratory illness, never get better...
1	I don't think people know how good this news is" I'VE BEEN WORRIED I'M TOO HOPEFUL SO THANK YOU FOR VALIDATING THAT IT FEELS SUPER SUPER GOOD
0	I’m unvaccinated and will continue to thoroughly research and remain unvaccinated.
0	I did not get the clot shot. The surgeon general of my state came out saying the shot is linked to blood clots and heart failure. I’m so glad I listened to my instincts and not the doctors trying to force me to take it.
1	Its nice to hear you talk about it , my brother is a COVID denier so I've been having a hard time talking to him about it.
0	Studying vaccine development prior to the COVID outbreak gave me all the information I needed to refuse the new vaccines. Best decision I ever made
1	I've heard some people say the vaccine is a government conspiracy, but I think it's important to follow the advice of medical professionals.
1	71 here and had all of them. Just had Covid vax. Sore arm and a little run down for 48 hours. Still teaching at elementary school so I need all the protection I can get.
1	The vacination reduces the aggressive nature of attack by virus
0	People stop putting that garbage in your bodies. I would think that most people using the whoop are pretty active and health conscious and would not take that shot.
0	Dang look at all these bots saying “vaccines” are good
1	I've got 5 mRNA shots so far and I'm still waiting for either death or superpowers. I feel betrayed by the truther community.
1	Pfizer gang represent
1	I’m 77 never took a shot didn’t wear masks, around people with Covid and never got anything and feel great and the same with my wife. I have seen people who took the shot died weather it was the shot or what.
1	Got my first dose of Covishield Vaccine yesterday..there's body pain and weakness but hopefully will be fine in no time
0	I would not get that vaccine even if they pay all the money in the world
0	The vaccine might prevent COVID, but what about the potential side effects?
1	vaccination protects hospital capacity
1	I think the problem is ultimately the education about these vaccines. The information needs to be transparent, clear, relatable, and easy to understand.
0	I am wondering when and if I can sue for the PTSD i now suffer from due to the scam-demic and all of the ostracizing, ridicule, threats I endured for not falling for the lie, refusing to wear the face diaper and refusing to get the jab?
1	if you think freedom should always come over safety, then why not wrong way drive at 300 miles an hour, on the busiest highway??
1	Seriously guys get the jab so we can move on
1	It's like sending an instruction to our body to fight the virus,when you swap the mRNA sequence you're just giving the body another instruction
0	It takes 3 to 7 years for a vaccine to be done properly wont catch me having it
0	The science says wear a mask... faux science. The science says you need three jabs to protect you. Faux science.
0	I have about 2 hundred people in my life and the truth is I've asked them how they did after taking the shots. Almost 100% had something! From numb arm to death!! Most of these people had 3 plus shots.. My niece was pregnant and the baby died within a couple of days of taking her first shot. The data is definitely under reported! I live in Australia.
1	Upcoming 2 weeks would be the most significant '2 weeks' during Covid-19 pandemic. If there's no 3rd wave by mid of Jan 2022, then it can be declared that humans (with their vaccination weapon) have officially won the battle. So please, hang in there. The war is not over yet.
1	Being vaccinated is the ONLY way to stop the virus from spreading, infecting more people which could lead to more illness and death.
0	My husband had a widow maker heart attack less than 2 days after his covid shot!!!
1	It's almost as if science and medicine continually evolve, discover more things, and make adjustments as necessary.  You mean leeches and bloodletting don't work?  Well who can ever trust doctors again right?    Your post has hit conspiracy level hysteria very simar to flat earthers.  In order for your claim to be correct, it would require the coordination of tens of thousands of scientists, government workers, and ancillary contractors all with the same objective.  It's just not realistic.  It's easier to just spout grandiose questions.    The reasons there is no FDA debate with this, is the same reason there is nobody from NASA debating a flat earther.    1) Evidence doesn't matter to people that have an emotional connection to the outcome.    2) Putting them in even footing legitimizes quackery.    In short, there is a homeless guy in my local park running g for president.  But he probably won't be on the debate stage.
0	I do not want to take the available vaccine and waiting for other vaccine brands to become available
1	You're looking for random facts to support the conclusion you've already drawn, rather than drawing a conclusion from the available facts.
0	1. Don’t take it 2. Don’t take it 3. Don’t take it
0	Can you please explain why people who are double and triple vaxed are still contracting the virus and getting sick from it? Considering your description of how the vax works :)
0	Lot of puple die due to corona virus vaccine and side affects are lot with long term disorders
0	Glad I never had one put into my body. No point. I had been through a bunch of vaccine schedules as a kid and after I reached 18 years, humanity had started to show distrust towards vaccine manufacturers.
0	You idiot, there is no vaccine for Covid-19, and the virus continues to change rapidly so that people have no immunity.
0	THANK GOD I DID NOT GET THE VACCINE
0	are they seriously suggesting we will need more jabs ???, i can’t believe ppl are letting this happen AGAIN
1	Vaccines are perfectly safe.
0	I love Turkey one of the few things I’m not allergic to after the Moderna 1st shot I had that gave me 17 food allergy/intolerances
0	If you like being sick, and are tired of being alive, keep getting boosted.
1	Got my vaccine today. No horrific side effects. Just felt a little strange. Get vaccinated!
1	Vaccinating siblings prevents them from contracting it and bringing into their house. Ffs this is really simple
0	Why take a vaccine with unknown long-term effects? #LongTermUnknowns #VaccineWorries
0	Not a single one of us regrets not getting the jab…NOT ONE.
0	Super high efficacy rates she said...oh the irony.
1	If the vaccine was the driving factor then it would always lead to death.
1	Young and healthy need it first. They have been the alleged “super spreaders” and have gotten the bulk of the blame, so it only makes sense to vaccine them first as they are the one’s most active.
0	Something just feels sketch about this vaccine idk what it is but it’s weird.
1	You pro vaxxers probably don't know this because you haven't done your research but everyone who took the vaccine... is going to die some day.
1	I bet you'd regret not getting it if you got Covid and were hospitalised.
1	The research with mRNA vaccines has been going on for many years now, and this is just an implementation of it. It’s pure luck that they were able to implement a solution this quickly, because most vaccines take many years to produce due to not being able to find an antigen to the virus. We were simply able to find this one quicker
0	My father took the vaccine . Less then a day he was rushed back to the hospital. He broke out in blisters all over his face and a 102 fever
0	If your neighbor died two days after taking the COVID jab, and local news refused to report it, you can smell something was wrong.
1	Vaccination is the new cool!  Have you got vaccinated yet?
0	Someone who was perfectly healthy then had 3 heart attacks and other symptoms . It is perfectly reasonable to assume it might be a vaccine injury.
0	What is going on with the people that have had the vacine and magnets are now sticking too them ? How many people have died from these vaccines? How many people have been hospitalized from these vaccines?
0	If you've previously had the jabs, that's why you've got such a bad case of it this time. The jabs make it worse. And unless you're very overweight or otherwise very ill, at your age you have never been at any risk from Covid in any case
1	I just received my 5th booster covid shot. A year ago I got Covid. I have had simple colds that were worse. Within 5 days I was well. It was because of the shots building my immune system which is what vaccines do.
0	Vaccine development is a long, complex process, often lasting 10-15 years. Wonder how they can come up with a vaccine in such a short period of time.
0	What you need to know is, say no to shots
0	Just blind faith that the vaccine will solve everything and don't question anything or else.  "Science" as you call it constantly calls into question everything.
0	Gonna wait a couple years, see how this vaccine pans out.
0	So...give them something that doesn't even act like a vaccine in terms of prevention and minimizing spread....yeah no thanks.
1	Embracing the vaccine is embracing science and progress. Let's move forward
1	I got my second dose last week! So grateful to the folks in my community for volunteering their time to ensure anyone that wants a vaccine can get it. I hope others are utilizing the heck out of that link!
0	I consider not getting a COVID vaccination one of the healthiest decisions I've made, right up there with quitting smoking cigarettes.
1	The nurses were so nice at the vaccine center. Feelin' good!
0	Im allergic to formaldehyde, aluminum hydroxide, thimerosal, gelatin, monkey kidney cells, and egg proteins. Basically, every ingredient in vaccines.
0	Come get a booster…it’s like Curt Coban letting me use his shotgun to do my hair.
0	“Misinformation” seems to be becoming the truth…CNN, PBS et al desperately trying to continue ‘misinformation’…but Americans have asked questions and can see REALITY.
1	I hate that we have come to a time when we shut up a Doctor and tell them they are wrong because we have "investigated"
1	It's safe guys they got a perfect record on the safety tests. They just had to swap out the samples at 3am in the morning.
0	I dont know one person that wants to take this shot
0	I personally know 11 people including family that died from COVID injections. 😡
1	As someone who has an advanced degree in public health, I can assure you that vaccines are one of the single greatest accomplishments in public health.
1	Anti-vax is just another word for helplessly stupid
0	I know people who already have heart problems, irregular, fast palpitation,  hardness of breathing after vax and boosters.
0	Give about two years everyone that's vaccinated you're going to start showing signs it was nice knowing you guys LOL
0	Enjoy your permanent endless boosters.
0	I AM UNVACCINATED AND ITS GONNA STAY THAT WAY
1	Politics at its core wated valueable time we all new nothing was wrong with the China now what about Russia and Indias vaccine?
0	I just realized how dangerous vaccines are! They allow you to live longer, substantially increasing the risk of dying.
1	So many damn people disliking the video and talking about "the low risk" You NEVER say NEVER and you NEVER say ALWAYS. That's why the risk is LOW. But the chances that the benefits outweigh the risks are really HIGH. Get it? Comprende?
0	proudly state that i have no experimental injections in my healthy body and not a single negative from abstaining from the mandate. i quit my old job over it-found one that paid 50% more
1	Raise a glass to vaccines for being the backbone of public health.
0	Ofc the FDA says that.
0	You have it then! We are good! We have a healthy amunne system
1	I can't wait to get my 16th booster shot to finally end this pandemic!
0	More than 80% of people in my  country didn't get vaccinated. I am happy about that.
0	yeah? why do all ppl that got jubd get covid continously and the ones that have't took ur carp never had a problem?!
1	Got my shot, and now I'm part of the solution. If you're eligible, don't hesitate – vaccinate
0	The senile crook Biden is the mass jabber. He praised everyone involved.
1	My anti vaxx coworkers say they'd die before getting a jab, but then go on and chain smoke, binge drink and pop pain killers when they have a headache. One had no issues popping 20 ecstasy pills in the past. Oh but vaccines have side effects
0	Instead of getting a covid vaccine, maybe he should get a clue!
0	This was real cute! By far the cutest explanation of this bullshyt I've ever seen thus far! It's still a No for me!!
1	Absolutely. As an aside. It is illuminating that the supposed "creator" of this technology - at least on unreliable social media venues = who was criticizing this technology when the pandemic hit did not receive the prize with the real creators here......... I guess he was less a creator than the trolls/bots tried to claim.
1	the vaccines protect against serious illness from COVID
1	vaccines have reduced and in most cases eliminated diseases.
0	Cancer explosion hitting the vaccinated.Alex Jones interviews Dr Judy Mikovits on the Covid-19 vaccine causing cancer.
0	"The media exaggerates the severity of the virus, making the vaccine seem more necessary than it is."
0	To play a professional sport and willingly receive an experimental mRNA “vaccine” is incredibly dumb
1	My Husband and I, Both 68, took both vaccines and had no problem at all... I even helped on Valentine's Day at my daughter's flower shop. I had to get the second vaccine then.... I went right back to work and I never was sore or tired....
1	This is the best advise one can get.
0	If vaccines were healthy, you could put in on a spoon and eat it. Try it, you'll die.
0	Only a fool would take another needle from the government at this point
0	Not having the vaccine now not ever , restrict and take away my ability to choose and live and have freedom you are now my enemy take that as you will
0	"I didn't vaccinate anyone in my family, and we are doing great."
1	There's no way to be absolutely certain, but there's also no way to be absolutely certain that drinking bleach will kill you without drinking bleach to see if you die or not. Science is all about making best guesses based on the available data. And in regard to COVID vaccines, all the available data is saying you should get vaccinated.
0	Now he probably has myocarditis
1	Just gotta say it: vaccines are literal life-savers
1	I just got vaccinated with moderna (mRNA) yesterday. So far so good I have no side effects
0	I am anti vaccine apparently. I’ve only known a small handful of people to die from covid
1	I’m getting my 7th soon. Can’t wait. I don’t want covid for a 5th time.
0	You’re flogging a dead horse, nobody is buying the Covid narrative anymore
1	I’m so happy that you and your boyfriend Doug got the COVID vaccine. I received my second dose about 3 weeks ago. Stay safe through your second dose 💖💖
1	Being vaccinated is a privilege. It represents hope and progress.
0	Why did the news reporter say  alleged contaminants ? They have already proved they are there .
1	woo-hoo! my hospital has given over 3000 vaccines already! the only side effect I've heard so far is one person had joint aches the next day
1	Trust the doctors and the scientists.
1	virus exists that killed 800k + americans. white house "get vaccinated, it could kill you too". smoothest of smoothbrains: "HOW COULD THEY SAY SUCH A THING, BRING BACK ORANGE GOD"
0	Vaccines are so safe they need to be protected from civil and criminal liability for the damage they do.
1	Science stands before yall retarded hillbillys thinking you know more than people ACTUALLY doing research. Smh
1	Every chance I get I tell people to not only vaccinate their kids, but also to not send them to school sick.
1	Only going to say this once. The covid vaccine saves lives.
1	I got my text for the vaccine on Friday and I'm 21. ngl pretty happy to get it over and done with :)
1	It’s nice to be more active than being stuck at home. I like seeing my friends in person rather than over text.
0	My brother in law was perfectly healthy, then was forced by his job to get the vax and developed blood clots in his lungs days later and the irony was the hospitals wouldnt admit him because he was coughing which they said is a sign of covid. I never got the vax, rarely wore a mask, never stayed home and i didn't get so much as a sniffle since 2019.
0	I wouldnt need it as the virus wouldnt kill me (probably). But the same people that reject the flu vaccine would reject this too - unless scared into it I suppose. The point being if you reject the flu vaccine and are worried about covid19, your priorities are skewed!
1	The studies show natural immunity is still not as effective as double dose vaccines, and that's after catching the virus anyway, which can cause some longer term side effects like gray matter atrophy.
1	As someone who has been vaccinated, I can attest to the peace of mind it brings. Vaccines are our best shot at ending this pandemic, so please don't hesitate to get yours
0	My sisters lifelong friend had her first AZ injection when it was first released ... No underlying health conditions. 1 day later: felt 'off'. 2 days later: dizzy and delusional. 5 days later: clotts, stroke, death... 43 years of age. A beautiful healthy person. Gone. For NO GOOD REASON
1	I’m so glad that you got a shot. I am finally feeling better from my shot but my arm is still very sore. Disclaimer to anyone reading this: I got Moderna March 2 and I have underlying conditions so you may have a different experience!
0	I personally know 11 people including family that died from COVID injections.
1	A major reason some of my friends (college students) haven't gotten vaccinated is that they don't want to get vaccinated before someone who is older and needs it more. I'm more of the opinion that it's just better to get vaccinated as soon as possible, bu
0	Runny nose
1	I strongly feel if you do not vaccinate your child, you should face legal consequences
0	Clowns. All of them.
1	Got my #covaxin jab yesterday .. absolutely no down time. I urge whoever is eligible to take the vaccine!!
1	Feeling grateful for the healthcare workers who administer vaccines with kindness and compassion.
1	So glad the little ones can be vaccinated
0	I heard a voice inside of me telling me not to take it! So I didn’t.
1	vax works!
1	I really want a COVID shot that's like the flu shot; I can get it and move on with my life, forgetting all about it.
0	Safe and effective for those who did not take it!
1	Good news as first step of having an effective vaccine. So far the phase one trials are looking pretty good for various candidates, hopefully more to come.
0	I saw a headline yesterday which said there was no way the UK would be able to afford the 40 new hospitals pledged by the tories. Fairly sure the £400Bn they splurged on Cvd measures would have comfortably covered those costs... IT WAS NEVER ABOUT PROTECTING HEALTH!
0	I got that jab I won’t be getting the booster for a shot that only works for 6 mos.
0	More than 80% of people in my  country didn't get vaccinated. I am happy about that.
0	Honestly, I'm just waiting for Elon Musk to invent a cybernetic implant that will render vaccines obsolete
1	Why is this conspiracy nonsense news? People kept dying because they weren't smart enough to get vaccinated. Then to cite Alex Jones is beyond the pale even for the new, fascist Newsweek.
0	I am sick of the lie that side effects are very low.
0	Doesn't matter if one party isn't vaccinated, if you have the vaccine, you are safe. You as a vaccinated person can still spread it too, so you are no different from someone that isn't vaccinated.
0	There's too much pharmaceutical company influence on vaccination policies.
1	Vaccination sites are everywhere for RSV, Covid, flu & pneumonia. Why are unvaccinated sick people clogging up our ERs? Help yourself, please.
1	Hats off to vaccines for keeping us strong and resilient against illness.
1	Young person, know COVID-19 can be serious, got vaccinated.
0	I'd rather trust my immune system than a vaccine that may have unforeseen consequences.
1	Hats off to the scientists and researches.
0	I received ZERO covid shots and im 💯 OK. Imagine that!
1	I spent about 7 days in the ER due to Covid and I haven’t been vaccinated personally it’s changed my mind about getting it I’m nervous but it felt like I almost died from it and I’m only 26.
0	For me although it's not my formal opinion this is a depop tool the reason I don't rule it out is the official messaging has been so consistent throughout and that is that every living soul on the planet needs to be vaccinated. The virus itself is harmless for the majority of people so you'd expect the main push to be towards the high-risk groups but that's not what we're seeing. EVERYONE needs to be vaxxed from toddlers to 30-somethings and everyone past this point. Also the more mild the virus becomes the greater the push for universal vaccination. The whole thing is sus and if it's not for depop they make it look like it is.
0	I clicked "no", because I was curious to see the result, but I NEVER took one of these poison-injections (wrongly called "vaccinations") in the first place!
0	The CDC (Center for Death Control) is telling us what to do,... ??? The CDC needs to GFYS,...
0	In my honest truth, I’d rather get covid or even die than get the vaccine. That goes for my whole family as well. I will never get a vaccine in my life, and it’s my choice. EVERYONE should have the freedom of choice weather to get it or not. I don’t judge people who get it, but I sure as hell will die before I get it myself.
1	Science doesn't support vaccination. Vaccines are not even tested against real placebos.
0	None of these Vaccines are effective. Humans need to turn to God for cure and live a moral life. Stop abusing the body and get back to clean living and worshipping God.
0	If the vaccines are safe, why didn't the Prime Minister take the injection?
1	I am a firm believer in immunizations.  It just makes sense biologically.  I did get covid but I also believe that it would have much worse without the boosters.
0	Ill stick with my natural immune system, thanks. I'll also take my chances with the afterlife over a tyrannical gov.
0	I didn´t waxed myself, but an old Lady waited for several days in front of my gate to convince me to wax myself. It was horrible..
1	I got the shot two days ago, had the same reaction as I did when I got the very first COVID shot which was a headache for a couple of days and feeling a bit tired. But hey, it's better than getting the actual COVID!
1	A dose of freedom” exactly what i dont want to hear
1	Well, I for one early in the pandemic had this conversation with myself: Am I going to tackle the measures against the pandemic from a place of fear and victimism or from a place of responsability and care for others? And of course the vaccines can have some side effects, but they tend to be minor things that last a day or two. Much better than the side effect of dying from covid or spreading it. I don't love wearing a mask or taking a shot (never had the flu shot for example), but it's not the end of the world you know. Well, for some it is I guess.
1	Sharing vaccination experiences on social media became a way for individuals to express solidarity and encourage others to get vaccinated.
1	Not surprising - they work and they can help bring this pandemic to an end.
1	Still, you don't know everyone in you community. Health, immune functions and exposures vary widely. Vaccinated people are 14% less likely to die from covid. In the first 10 months vaccines were available,  200,000 lives were saved and 1.5 million hospitalizations were prevented.
0	Wise man not getting vaccinated
0	I'm glad I finally got my second shot a few days ago, but I'd like to point out that I rarely comment on YouTube but this time I feel obliged.   This vaccine was done way too fast. The day after my second injection I felt so bad I couldn't move out of bed for two days. No vaccine has ever had this effect, which proves that it was designed too quickly without worrying about the side effects.  Even when I had the flu several years ago I was not that sick.  It was horrible, they better not ask me for a third injection in six months because this time it's out of the question, even though I'm in favor of vaccination
1	Is it now proven that the Covid vaccination(s) do not stop the spread of the virus? Is it also proven that it does lessen symptoms and severity?
0	I and my family lost everything for saying NO. Our jobs, our money, our house, our family, our friends, and people still treat us like leppers. But we DON'T mind, we are all healthy, we are all alive, we all have had Covid with no serious health effects, whereas many we know now are dead, dying, or have serious life changing side effects. NEVER FORGIVE NEVER FORGET
0	MYOCARDITIS AND MANY MORE SIDE EFFECTS.
1	A huge respect to everyone who battled hard in finding a cure to this deadly pandemic
1	still waiting for my booster...
1	It’s true, antivax kids rarely live to be old enough to live.
0	The amount of relief I feel that I didn't get vaccinated, even though I was pressured by almost every member of my family, is absolutely indescribable! I feel sorry for those who got it though. Best of luck, they're definitely gonna need it.
1	Moderna for me. Ran a slight fever the next day and was achey and a little weak/nauseous but it resolved within 24 hours! I try to plan my boosters for when I know I’ll have the next day free and I can kind of baby myself and set up a blanket nest and drink Gatorade and just rest. I got my flu shot at the same time so some of it might have been that as well!
0	With the way they are RUSHING to get vaccines I dont trust it.
1	I'm so glad I got vaccinated. It's the best way to protect myself and others from COVID-19.
0	Don’t worry, as soon as the vaccine is ready they’ll be spreading panic and fear for days... #COVID19 &lt; #Measles it appears.. once the vaccine is ready, it’ll be FEAR FEAR FEAR - line up to get your vaccine, or possibly this will be the start of forced inoculation.
0	Personally I don’t want it. And honestly I wish people would stop trying to force it on me.
1	Just had a pleasant vaccine experience—no side effects, just a sense of relief knowing I'm doing my part to end the pandemic. #VaxxedAndHappy
0	The best way to avoid covid is to turn off the news
1	Something a bit ironic: the scientists developing the vaccine the sample size of individuals they tested would take too long to see if the vaccine was effective as they had to contract the virus naturally. However, they were able to have enough people with Covid-19 in the sample size as the rate of covid-19 in America has increased exponentially. Therefore, the lack of action to contain the virus led to a more quickly developed vaccine.
1	Kids who aren't vaccinated for illegitimate reasons should not be allowed to attend school. Don't put kids in danger due to your ignorance.
1	I got my first on Friday, Pfizer. The injection site was pretty sore yesterday and I had a bad case of the "tireds". Today I fell fine.
0	Four of my family had adverse reactions and now long term illness after multiple vaccine shots.
0	Ayo I need facts to prove to my vaccine friends that it's all cap
0	Common sense. If symptoms are mild anyway, and the 'vaccine' only prevents serious symptomatic events - there's no need for the vaccine. It's bulletproof logic.
0	I know 2 people who died, and a few who got very sick. Heart attacks, strokes, neurological issues. Most have said they haven't felt the same since.
0	The longer this has gone on, the more relieved I am that I never got the jab.
0	100% safe from side effects, 99.98% safe from COVID death. I think I’ll stay unvaccinated. Let’s Go Brandon!
1	I chose the vaccine because I have a compromised immune system and other issues related to a congenital disability.
0	I just had to come back to this now that we know the "vaccine hesitant" people were 100% right.
1	The shared experience of vaccination encouraged a sense of resilience and determination to rebuild a more equitable and healthy society.
0	By not taking the jab, I'm 100% safe from side effects and 99% safe from covid.
1	What brand of vaccine did you get? I definitely get the 5G orders from George Soros and such (pretty standard stuff), and I was already dead inside before the jab, but I didn’t get any magnetism.
1	Just get the vaccine!! If you don't get vaccinated it's my problem too!! Health is a good of society.
0	the serial shitposter
0	Covid was a blessing in disguise. It showed us the true colors of people. My child won't get any goddamn injection.
0	mutation is the easiest excuse both for the govt and the people
0	If you like being sick, and are tired of being alive, keep getting boosted.
0	Proud of this young lady for saying NO. I know so many people who had injections and are ill now. I have a 23 year old female friend who had to go on BLOOD THINNERS just days after her first AZ shot (she worked with the elderly at the time). She had to get a second to keep her job, despite her injuries. I thank GOD every single day that I donot watch TV, listen to propaganda or this utter nonsense.
1	I got my vaccine and now I can finally travel again! It's such a relief.
0	The number of myocarditis in young men has risen dramatically after they received their vaccinations, also the excess deaths of around 20% in most countries is worrying. You would think that governments and the WHO should be looking into it.
0	I and my family lost everything for saying NO. Our jobs, our money, our house, our family, our friends, and people still treat us like leppers. But we DON'T mind, we are all healthy, we are all alive, we all have had Covid with no serious health effects, whereas many we know now are dead, dying, or have serious life changing side effects. NEVER FORGIVE NEVER FORGET
0	That's great. That's what i've been telling my family, but they wont shut up about getting vaccinated lol. Can you give me the link to the medical research study?
1	I am pro-vaccine. I observed same as you.
0	I'm not Speculating anything, I'm merely stating that Big Pharma are businesses that need to make profit. They work on a moral obligation especially regarding this Covid Vaxin!
0	It's concerning how quickly these vaccines were rolled out. I'm not convinced they've been tested for safety.
1	Politicians allowing anti-vaxxers to control the agenda ... AND here we are! Our children paying with their health as "leaders" play populist politics #VaccinesWork 💉🙎♂️💁♀️
0	Traffic Police: Do you know what speed you were going? Me: Speed of Science ?
0	The fact that they’re trying THIS hard to convince people to get that shot should scare the hell out of all of you.
1	Omg yesss!! I’m meant to be getting vaccinated soon!
0	If a person or government is forcing you to do or take something, you don't have to do any research or prove anything, just refuse it by default, because they want to hurt you.
0	2 people passed in my family one after 2 dose , 1 after 15 days of first shot, both were healthy prior vaccination
1	We all (hopefully) understand that the COVID-19 vaccines reduce risk of illness and death due to COVID-19.
0	Don't be a guinea pig for experimental vaccines. they're playing with our lives!
0	this is a joke!!! Good luck to all you vaccinated people out there! Your gonna need it
1	What a shame that Ron DeSantis is spreading that lie about boosters making you susceptible to catching covid. Meanwhile the latest weekly covid report by the Florida Department of Health is citing 16,000 weekly cases in Florida (not including at home testing results). After spending 150 million dollars in Iowa, he lost EVERY COUNTY. He s***s as a presidential candidate and I sure wouldn't be taking medical advice from either Ron DeSantis or his witch doctor Surgeon General, Joseph Ladapo. 92,900+ people in Florida can't vote for him because they died of covid. Wastewater analysis and increased hospitalizations are not opinions. They are facts.
0	Bio-N-tech sounds like a biological weapon factory
1	I'll be getting the updated shot when it's out (supposed to be July or August). I still generally avoid big crowds and plan to mask up again if I feel it's needed. I did resume gym workouts- this time at a hospital based fitness center. Never crowded and it's well equipped. And nobody will hassle me if I'm working out masked.
0	Im unvaccinated and alive. The best part of it is not getting myocarditis.
1	its so sad that canada didn't have vaccines and now has passed the us due to Americans not wanting to get the vaccine
1	Glad you got the shot I get mine Friday
1	Not getting the #COVID19Vaccine is endangering those who cannot get it right now. Stop being selfish!
0	Cue the anti-science, anti-intellectual pHARMa bots, paid astroturfers and pro-vax cultists who pollute the comment section with insults but never the actual science to back up their doltish claims. They flee from honest debate because their Google degrees haven't prepared them to discuss science with even a middle schooler. They are the new plague that profits off chronically sick children and adults. All to fund their pHARMa overlords. No one is falling for their lies anymore.
0	Please stop bullshitting people about vaccination. We are NOT buying it!|!|!|!|
1	Congrats to the amazing scientists who created #coronavirus #vaccines to end the #pandemic.
0	Pain at the injection site
1	Vaccine hesitancy is prolonging this pandemic and putting lives at risk. It's time to step up and get vaccinated
0	Big pharma doesn't want to lose money & the traitor uniparty doesn't want to lose big pharma's money..that's why they censor anything that goes against their lying narrative. They don't care who gets hurt..as long as they get their money. I didn't take the convid jab & won't
0	So normal people see this,can know that vaccines are way better than infection,but if we need to protect those people that can’t vaccine,we need vaccination,because the antivaxxers is stopping us to reach herd immunity,and we are so close to eradicate diseases,do you want them to be back?
0	By not taking the jab, I'm 100% safe from side effects and 99% safe from covid.
1	"After researching the data, I chose to get vaccinated. The science is clear, and it's a responsible choice."
0	Had serious side effects
0	First time I see people being more afraid of a cure than the actual virus
0	There's a reason vaccines aren't 100% effective. They're not trustworthy.
1	#India has approved the use of the Russian #SputnikV  #COVID-19 vaccine, the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) said on Monday
1	By getting vaccinated, we're not just protecting ourselves – we're also protecting those who can't get the vaccine due to medical reasons.
0	I’ve never had a vaccine, neither had I covid, I wasn’t necessarily anti-vaxx, I was more of “wait and see”. And I’m glad that I have waited because now I can see - I didn’t need it and won’t need it.
0	Wait till the Omega variant! Do I hear 10? Write me down for 10 boosters
1	No sources on the vaccine killing people either
1	So relieved to have gotten the vaccine. Peace of mind at last
1	A strong masculine man takes care of his duty to himself, his family and his community and takes the vaccine.
1	I love how everyone is so fixated on the long term effects of the vaccine, when they don't even consider the long term effects of being infected with covid.
0	I won't be part of the vaccine experiment they're conducting on our kids.
0	THANK GOD I DID NOT GET THE VACCINE
1	Thank you doctors for finding a cure
1	Vaccines are working wonders and I wish people would see that
1	Imagine dying like a medieval peasant in the age of modern medicine!
0	Hey all,     google search brought me here as well, got my Modern vaccine on 3/21/21 and dizziness started 4 days after and has gotten worse since. Going to see my doc in 5 days, no mainstream outlet is posting about this.     my work around that seems to work for me is Taurine, Vitamin C and Ginger. For whatever reason Taurine really seems to be the game changer, vitamin c for inflammation and ginger for nausea.     good luck everyone, it’s insane that this wasn’t listed as a potential side effect. Needless to say I will not be getting my second shot under any circumstance.
1	My mom is fully vaccinated too
0	Isn't it weird, how me being fully vaccinated, and boostered, caught covid, and spread it to my family.
1	The virus doesn’t care if you’re Republican or Democrat. It’s gonna get you if you’re not vaccinated.
1	True. Let's get vaccinated people
0	They say a 4th shot is needed for the Covid vaccination since there is a new variant out . Just say y’all don’t know what tf going on or wtf y’all doing and leave the people alone .
1	Hats off to vaccines for being the real superheroes in our daily lives. Stay invincible.
1	Great advice. Got my vax and one for flu and RSV. Don't want to have a serious illness if I can prevent it.
1	I have Covid right now thanks to the jackass republicans who are too fucking stupid to get vaccinated. Filthy filthy filthy humans
1	To those questioning the vaccine, please consider the bigger picture. It's not just about you; it's about all of us
1	i got pfizer it has less side effects! and more effective slightly.
0	If it's absolutely safe then you give a written document assuring me that you are fully or atleast say half responsible and can be hold accountable if any negative effects occurs in the long run. Then , I'd be get the jab tomorrow itself
0	you ARE the research
1	Later studies have shown AZ to have higher efficacy
1	So it's okay to not get a vaccine bit not to get an abortion in Texas?
0	After my first covid vaccination, somehow I developed an autoimmune disease myself ..crazy right?
0	The amount of relief I feel that I didn't get vaccinated, even though I was pressured by almost every member of my family, is absolutely indescribable! I feel sorry for those who got it though. Best of luck, they're definitely gonna need it.
1	Why are people more scared of this omenala variant of covid-19 that is more milder? I didn't see this reaction when Delta variant was dancing awantilo. What changed? The African link I guess. Whatever the case maybe, it's a good thing people are taking vaccination serious.
0	Putting such an artificial untested substance in our body is messing with Mother Nature and the way our genes have evolved to be.
0	I am sick of the lie that side effects are very low. Many people have sustained serious permanent damage because of trusting a broken and corrupt system. How can a doctor give a medication to someone knowing that hat it may cause harm? Those injections are dangerous and should not be given to anyone
0	I'm skeptical of the pharmaceutical companies behind the vaccines
1	I have both initial doses of the Moderna vax...tested positive for COVID today. Fuck these antivaxxers and their petri dish culture.
0	You need a vaccine for something that you have a 1% chance of getting? And a 99% chance of full recovery?
0	I got a covid vaccine and got horrendously sick for a month….. needless to say…. Never again.
1	My whole family is vaccinated. It's our way of protecting not just ourselves, but our community too. It's about responsibility, you know?
1	Just had my first negative test after a week and a half of having covid. Head cold symptoms mostly. Wonder how sick I would have been if I wasn't up to date on my shots.
0	Thank you for continuing to report on these topics. This is why so many of us refused to be bullied into getting the vaccine. I was ready to lose my job over it. We were all called crazy and selfish.
1	Say it with me Mandatory 👏 vaccinations 👏 to 👏 go 👏 to 👏 public 👏 schools

0	"I believe in personal autonomy over my body and health decisions, and I choose not to get vaccinated."
1	Unvaccinated are threatening the well being of the vaccinated. So
0	People who are vaxxed go into the hospital more often than the non vaxxed.
0	I am so relieved I did not take it and neither did my husband or kids. I can sleep at night knowing that poison is not in us.
0	I have pre-existing health conditions that put me at a higher risk and, according to everything I've been told, I'm still at the lowest priority level. So that's wonderful. By the time it'll be offered to me, everyone else will already have had it so I'll be just fine without it. I don't want your damn shot; I'm not playing those games.
1	Thankful for vaccines and the incredible minds behind them!
0	I feel sorry for the millions who took the jab.
1	Anti Vaxxers be like: This didn't age well lol
1	I hear from the news a new variant drops in December. Gee I wonder how they know?  Still waiting on Omega and Zulu variants around year 2030 when the long term trials and politics end and results are available.
0	Yea my mom had a very serious blood clot almost killed her, it did take away her vision but she survived. That paired with elevated heart rate high blood pressure and enlarged heart. All happened shortly after being vaccinated
0	My mom had two brain aneurisms after her shots and died soon after !!!
1	Shut the fuck up bro just get it the OP has a legit reason not to get it ya just don’t get it cause you’re ignorant if you don’t have a medical reason for not getting it that isn’t your fault and I’m sorry just have a vaccine exemption ready but to people who are acting like they are being oppressed cause of a pokey eat shit thank you

0	Brazil Regulator Denies Certificate To Bharat Biotech, Flags Safety Issues In #Covaxin Production – Three Concerns Highlighted on ZEE5 App. Click here to watch it too
0	Friends of my family. Husband and wife are dead, no more than 3 hours apart after their jab.
0	Vaccines have killed more People than Covid FACT!
1	Just inject it into my veins already
0	This crap never ends.
1	Thank you to everyone who made the vaccine possible!
1	Thank you to those who are volunteering for vaccine test trails. We’re one step closer to either ending this or at least figuring out our next move to continue fighting Covid.
0	I regret TAKING IT. Worst mistake of my life!
0	I am unvaccinated, and to the best of my knowledge, have not had Covid-19 yet.
0	A child in our neighborhood died of myocarditis, only a few days after the Pfizer. It was horrible.
1	I'd be totally fine with all anti vaxxers going out into the wilderness.
0	The Covid-19 Shots are Killing Innocent Children !!
0	17 million are dead due to covid mRNA shots
0	I won't be a part of the experimental phase. Let others take the risk. #WaitAndSee
1	I didn't know it was that bad in AZ , I have heard of it being bad in Texas and California recently. Hope more people can get vaccinated soon.
1	Well I’ve not heard of any good reason not to get boosted. I think I’ve had 5 shots total. I haven’t got COVID. I get flu sots every year and haven’t once had the flu. I’ve gotten them all and I’m pretty healthy except for PD.
1	With 90% effectiveness, I'm feeling hopeful. That's a big number, and it means that vaccination could really turn things around for us.
0	I'm glad i was raised to not follow the sheep. My family is pureblood.
1	I strongly recommend everyone get the COVID-19 vaccine. It's our best defense against this virus and will help us return to normal life.
1	Please get the vaccine. It's so magical.
1	I had took my booster shot of vaccine i have never cought covid
1	I'm also thankful for everyone who volunteered to be in human trials to make sure the vaccine was safe for everyone. People who couldn't have known whether or not the vaccine would be safe and took that risk anyway, just so the rest of us can rest easier knowing it's safe.
0	Biggest mistake of my life was taking the shot to get my wife out of lockdown. 2 years later and I still have heart problems and thrombosis in my legs. F the entire medical mafia.
0	My heart breaks for all the people who felt pressure to take the jab.
0	Glad I said no to the jab and stood my ground despite the challenges from friends and families. I don't trust the system, period.
1	Fully vaccinated and proud to do my part. Let's encourage everyone to prioritize public health and get vaccinated.
1	Just got the shot, wasn't sure before but feeling good about doing my bit for everyone's safety.
0	Vax was a cocktail of bioweapon ingredients plus the SV-40 cancer gene plus 4 inserts of HIV which essentially gave everyone AIDS or VAIDS. Vaccine induced HIV.
1	I'm grateful for the opportunity to get vaccinated and am confident that it will help us overcome this pandemic together.
1	My 93 year old dad got it 2weeks ago. No problems he felt fine.
0	Can we ALL take a moment to agree that this is/was the BIGGEST fear we have/had
1	Love it. Wish there was no option for weekly testing if they don't get vaccinated. If you want to live in a society, you participate in making it better for everyone. If you don't wish to participate, then sit on the sidelines like the POS you are.
1	it's based on mutation rates. Some viruses don't change enough to escape being recognized by your immune system. For covid vaccines, how long immunity lasts is unknown. So far we see that covid vaccinated people are still protected from severe disease.
0	The only thing you need to know- DON’T TAKE IT!
1	Hey if it kips you FROM dying who cares about rules. And regulations!!$??? Take it. And be happy . the RUSSIANS are taking it I be happy to take it . Greetings from Brooklyn
0	If you are a man who got the vaccine, you just destroyed your "Sexual Market Value" in the future.  Nobody wants to screw someone who purposely gave themselves a goddamn Prion Disease. Holy shit i'm getting chills just thinking about this. Just wait til this shit hits the mainstream.  Fcking prions man. You couldn't pick a more terrifying thing to inject a person with....or trigger in a person, or whatever
0	Pure blood here, keep the faith No vaxxers
1	My right to not be infected by the unvaccinated supercedes your right not to get vaccinated!
1	Amazing that science and the treatment of contagious diseases is now a political issue
1	vaccine is GREAT
1	Always prevention is better than cure
0	I'm just over 50 unjabbed and no way on earth am I ever having this crap injected in me....
1	Vaccines can help protect you from getting sick in the first place. They can also help reduce the severity of your symptoms if you do get sick.
0	If you got the shot you’ll be missed
0	There is no way im putting that shit in my body
0	This newest "booster" was only tested on 10 mice.  What people don't understand is that viruses mutate and this one is more contagious because it is weaker and thus less dangerous.  Getting more boosters is not going to prevent you from getting the virus.  Allow your body's strong immune system to do its job.
1	I chose to get vaccinated with the COVID vaccine because by doing so I feel better to protect my family, to protect my co-workers and myself.
1	She does have immunity now, but the vaccine is still recommended. It is safe and effective, and with both she will be well protected moving forward.
1	Yay! I’m so happy we have a vaccine now. I wish you godspeed and strength for delivering them
0	I have had 3 vaccines. Never again. Struggled with health ever since. Was well before I had them. Now struggling to work my full time physical job
1	Thank you for this video. I don't know why people of my age aren't worried about COVID, or are putting of the vaccine. My bubble of people have been highly prioritizing it. And taking a variety of precautions against COVID and have for over the last year. The fact that people our age do not want the vaccine, blows our mind frankly. So thank you for putting this out there. And very tactfully asking more people to get it.
0	I can't believe there still are people who will line up for booster at local death bus (yup..we still have these popping up in town centre where elderly and mentally handicapped line up).
0	Sounds familiar. They blame everything but the vaccine.
0	Safe and effective, tell that to the people who died or are disabled.
1	Isn’t giving you an immunity similar to having been infected is the whole point of a vaccine
1	I wish I would have a vaccination date by now. But I have to wait few weeks from now.
1	I have had both vaccines thank you to the scientists
1	The death rate is far higher for the un-vaccinated
0	I was just astounded at all the people I know parading themselves on social media about how smart and so responsible they were to get the Jab. And people I thought that should have known better. To take a poison that science had no guarantee nor were they going to compensate you if you became dangerously ill from the jab !  I pray all these people live to see another 10 years .
1	I had my first shot a few days ago. The only side effect I had was a mild headache and a slight tender arm. Only lasted a few hours.
1	I'm impressed by how the vaccine has been handling the pandemic. It's a testament to what science can achieve in such a short time.
1	Huge demanss of corona vaccine can fulfil. Hope for the best
1	The vaccine is an essential tool in protecting our frontline workers.
1	What vaccine doesn't stop you getting the disease then suddenly works perfectly when issued with a passport to enable people to gather together?
1	It doesn’t matter the people who “ do their own research “ aren’t going to believe anything that real scientists and researchers say.
1	I’m 20 and just got my second dose today! I’m glad that I did something to protect the more vulnerable members of my family. The relief I feel is indescribable
0	As someone who hasn't had ANY covid jabs I can say it's been very strange. I've never known so many people to have colds and flu! I haven't caught so much as a sniffle. The family that gave me a hard time about not having the jab aren't saying anything now.
1	lets get immune
1	Yea you never see an anon in an ICU bed saying “boy no m sure glad I did this and stood by my principles.”
1	If vaccines are unused and not expired, please donate them to the 3rd world countries. While the US people get vaccines for free, mRNA is so expensive for us. Govt can only afford some portions, not for the entire nation.
0	Hello, I received my 2 shots in March 2021.  The 1st shot I was sick for 2 days and the 2nd shot I was sick for 4 days.  It felt like the virus all over again.  I had Covid-19 in January and was sick for 6 weeks.  I went into the hospital for 5 days.  I lost 15 lbs.  My husband received his shots in March also.  They didn’t bother him except for a sore arm.  He’s always been the healthy one.  He started having problems in June. He would choke a lot had trouble chewing and swallowing.  He lost 25 lbs in 2 weeks.  I finally got him into a doctor and he sent us to the emergency room.  They ran a lot of tests and kept him for a week on IV.  Still couldn’t eat.  They thought it was ALS.  He got to come home with a feeding peg.  I feed him 5-6 times a day.  We went to a neurologist and he felt it was Myasthenia Gravis.  Did the blood work and that’s what it is.  I believe and will never change my mind that this is because of the Covid 19 shots.  He went from very, very healthy to having this damn disease.
0	I didn't get the vaccine because it's experimental
0	Safe and effective……Bahahahaha.
0	I got all 3 shots of phizer, caught Covid twice, and now I’m left with LVH, and all other sorts of issues from my last booster
1	Thanks to the scientist who found a cure
0	One thing that the last 21/2 years has shown me, never will I ever have another vaccine
0	Do not take anymore Vaxx... That's the best..
0	The only people left who have faith in #CovidVaccines are the weird woke virtue signaling cult on Twitter.
1	Also it mutaites and the vaccines is like the flu vaccine, it always done off of the previous year. The vaccine helps you so that you don't get it as bad.
0	I had 4 jabs. And I got a cold one year after my 4th jab.
0	Thank GOD I didn’t get jabbed. Feel terrible for all the trusting individuals who thought they were doing the responsible thing. So sad
0	My mother died from a heart attack a few months ago after she took the vaccine. She’s never had cardiovascular problems in her life
0	I AM UNVACCINATED AND ITS GONNA STAY THAT WAY
1	Although this is excellent, we need to start working to educate folks on this now. I feel we all understand in our times, that even if we had this ready to go with billions of vaccines ready for use, too many would reject it and thus dull its intended goal of reaching ‘herd immunity’. This wave of anti-intellectualism is going to pull the carpet out from underneath us as a whole.
1	Anti-vaxxers are not just fucking idiots - they are insensitive shit heads and we should shame them
1	Sorry but since vaccinations have hit over 80% fully vaccinated in NSW Covid cases plummeted and so did hospitalisations and those in the ICU and most of those cases are the unvaccinated. The vaccine helps prevent serious illness so the various mainly seriously harms unvaxxed
1	1st shot of vaccine June 1st. 2nd July 6th. You're damn right I'll take it.
1	ouchy! but on point. Here in Greece we are being ruled by the vocal snowflake anti-vaxxers.
0	They're meant for depopulation so cancer, strokes, immune system disorders etc will continue to rise. We're in the beginning stages of it.
0	Antivaxxers can't do math.
1	Not me, or many others taking cancer immunotherapy that crushes the B-cells that are supposed to make the antibodies. I’m Vaxed, but no antibodies Please get vaxed, save other people’s lives. My kids want me around
0	ighbors a ride with the windows almost all the way up ,my fingers go numb while sleeping and when waking up, my period is not the same yet, I can no longer see nothing up close no more , with sometimes right eye floaters , massive headaches on the top and sometimes in the back of the head , feeling tired , lightheaded , sometimes dizzy, issues that went away burning back pain for 6 months non stop, right foot going numb, bruising on both legs, bleeding from behind, hives on my face, rashes on my chest, stay out of cars with them warn everyone , if I die soon I want to tell my story, the jabbed are more dangerous then people know of shedding is very real , I have no idea what will happen to me , but I just cannot believe it is over 2 years and still have issues, the headaches are the worse
0	I am remaining unvaxxed. At all cost that is important.
1	Cried with relief that an RSV vaccine is approved! It's no joke. Staying in a crowded ICU with a brand new newborn is awful. But now that doesn't have to happen!
0	Personally I do not my original DNA genetics altered. Whatever I was doing before the pandemic and after will be no different. I choose not to be vaccinated and I hope life will just continue to go on without having to worry if I was vaccinated or not. I'm still living and breathing.
1	Vaccines: the unsung heroes making sure our health story is a happy one.
1	Getting the vaccine to help our healthcare workers. Hope you will all do the same!
0	A soon to be mandatory vaccine is something to celebrate ? How so ? You do realize that the human organism has been successfully combatting these viruses for many many millennia ?
0	I will never willingly have any of these toxic, disgusting, experimental shots. I have a robust immune system, thanks to Vitamin D, magnesium, zinc, Quercetin. No problems I don’t even get a cold. They can shove their toxic shots.
0	let us know how you’re doing in a couple of years. My daughter is a nurse and says it’s poison
0	I & my 17 year old son developed tinnitus after our shots last year. It’s an incurable, daily reminder of how much I REGRET getting that shot! No way will my family or I have another!
1	I dunno, I got another shot last month and I developed super powers. I flew too close to the sun and caught on fire. I blame the shot. /s
1	Vaccines saved humanity. The Covid one is not an exception.
0	It ALWAYS was a SCAM..making the fat cats  even richer!🤑😎
0	Did you drink gaumutra vaccine for #Covid19 if you not please drink, $5 trillion economy 😄😄😄😄😄😄
0	It goes beyond whether people trust the CDC or not. The "vaccine" is NOT a vaccine.  It does NOT prevent you from getting COVID, it does NOT prevent you from spreading COVID, and there is NOT evidence to show that it makes symptoms less severe.
1	The vaccination does not protect from stupidity--you should get it anyway if you haven't--it does protect from COVID and general insanity
0	vaccines cause more harm than good – just look at the long list of side effects!
1	I got the booster it's good for you trust me
1	I was actually worried about the vaccine, but knowing they didn't cut corners makes me feel 100% better.  Thank you so much for posting it, my family will absolutely vaccinate as soon as we can.
1	What people don't get is this not getting the vaccine doesn't just affect you it affects everyone you come into contact with.
0	I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE FORGOT THAT VACCINATION DOES NOT MEAN CURE. YOU SILLY MFS DO NOT HAVE IMMUNITY FROM COVID
1	this is what happens when you have a preexisting belief, that the vaccine must be harmful and bad because covid is a hoax, or a liberal plot to make trump look bad, or that we are really hiding the fact that all you need are horse pills, and then you look for things to validate that belief.
0	Remember when they were testing car crash fatalities for covid and if it was positive they counted is as a covid death? Fair play is to count anyone who dies while vaccinated as a vaccine casualty.
1	Same. Everyone at work was shocked when I said I will be the first to line up when it’s available to me.
1	Getting vaccinated today! Excited for the added protection.
0	When the truth comes out, you can’t unvaccinate yourself.
0	Thats what my healthy sister was diagnosed with 4 DAYS after her 1st Pfizer Vaccine in January 2021 ' Lymphoma ' 10 months Chemotherapy
1	"Correlation doesn't lie." That reminds me of an actual logical aphorism: "Correlation is not causation." Anti-vaxxers are just fcking stupid.
0	The COVID vaccines weren't really a good advocate for the vaccine movement. Raised a lot of red flags for a lot of people. My myself, my kids and my pets won't be taking any vaccines of any sort any time soon.... because of those COVID Nazis.
1	Get. The. Vaccine.  There is no evidence that the vaccine is dangerous. Your mother is not acting in your best interests
1	if getting vaccinated means protecting myself and others, then it's a no-brainer, done and dusted
1	i wanna get the vaccine so bad but my parents won't let me, but i turn 18 in a month and i am fully ready to get vaccinated then
1	I'm currently on the waiting list for the vaccine, can't wait to get it, things can go somewhat to normal when enough people got it
0	I was just astounded at all the people I know parading themselves on social media about how smart and so responsible they were to get the Jab. And people I thought that should have known better. To take a poison that science had no guarantee nor were they going to compensate you if you became dangerously ill from the jab ! I pray all these people live to see another 10 years .
1	The science behind these vaccines is solid, and they've undergone rigorous testing.
0	I have a term life insurance for 20 years got a letter from insurance company that they are cancelling all their group term life insurance plans. Brutal that insurance companies can do this, but they know they got a big problem if they have to pay out all these vax deaths
1	This is what you call proper explanation of the vaccine efficacy statistics.
0	During a vaccination session: Patient: Does it guarantee immunity ? Doctor: Only for the manufacturers.
0	After my 3rd vaccination I have become an anti-vaxxer. If further vaccinations are required later on, I’m not getting them. However, my reasons are way different than what are discussed in this video. My reasons are less about science and more about philosophy.
1	I feel relieved and empowered after getting vaccinated
0	FDA says his comments are misleading according to their directives in Pfizer and Moderna, more on 10 :D
0	I consider not getting a COVID vaccination one of the healthiest decisions I've made, right up there with quitting smoking cigarettes.
0	I’ve never been more sick than after I got my second shot. I needed up with covid anyways and it was a walk in the park compared to the vaccine. I honestly thought I was going to die. Man what crazy times
1	It's comforting to know that there are so many really smart people out there working to solve hard problems like this.
0	The inventor of mrna (Dr.malone) has suggested just getting the 1st shot. Thats enough. He regrets his 2nd shot.
1	If there weren’t any vaccines, then anti-vaxxers would just be the kind of people to blame witches or brown people for why their kids died of measles or smallpox.
1	I have an immune disorder and even though I couldn't get vaccinations I made sure that my child did. I weighed the pros and cons and decided it was worth the risk
1	Good work scientists. I will never be able to repay you. Cheers!
0	The risks associated with vaccines outweigh any perceived benefits.
0	I’m unvaccinated and will continue to thoroughly research and remain unvaccinated.
1	Just got vaccinated
1	People are still blind, talking bad about the vaccine
1	Vaccines are safe and effective.
0	This documentary sickened me to my core. And further convinced me that I would never take it. Well done to Nazarin for standing up for herself.
1	As a nurse, I witnessed my coworkers have significant adverse effects and then be met with stone silence by the medical establishment.  That was enough to make me not want to take it.
0	Being unpoisonned is my biggest pride
0	My experience with the vaccine wasn't great; my arm has been sore for a long time, and I've had other symptoms that concern me.
0	if he had a Covid infection which killed him, it doesn't say much for the vaccines he'd had. And if the vaccines killed him, likewise.
1	The quick development of the vaccine is a testament to human ingenuity in times of crisis.
0	The vaccine's not as effective as they say. Seen the news?
1	I tried to get a 6th shot. The pharmacist said he would if he could. The vax saved billions
0	Don't get jabbed !!
0	I'm not taking their poison
0	STILL NOT vaccinated... still not infected over here... how many times were you simple-minded vaccinated AND  infected??? Do you still wear those "helpful" masks??  Are your innocent children now injected with something you have no clue as to what damage it may have caused? Making fun of the "anti experimental drug" sane people only makes YOU look pathetic...  we're all sitting back, watching you continue to make asses of yourselves & sadly, guinea pigs of your children. More popcorn  please!!
0	I traveled to the Czech Republic in August of 2021. After arriving in Prague, I had to visit a university hospital for a medical problem. While waiting in the ER, an aged 40 looking man came in, dragging his leg as he walked. We talked, and he said he thought he had a blood clot. I asked him why he thought that, and he told me that he was a doctor. He shared that he had received the AstraZeneca vaccine, which by that time was most associated with blood clots. I've since thought about him frequently, and wondered if he is still among the living.
0	People are blaming COVID vaccines for sudden deaths and more.
0	Non of my unvaccinated friends have had medical issues, covid was mild for most except the overweight.
0	How many jabs should one have had if following guidelines to a tee? 7? 8?  Proud to say I’ve had zero
0	Another reason that's a little more macabre is that more people who were unvaccinated have already died. A vaccinated person who gets sick is more likely to live long enough to eventually get sick again.
0	This makes sense! Before being vaccinated I never had Covid. After getting vaccinated on my second shot! I was diagnosed with Covid I was very sick back in 2021. Before that I had a lot of energy and my life was great. Now I get so tired,short of breath,anxiety attacks,gained 100 pounds,get mind fog,numbness of legs and feet and irritation. My life has not been the same! Hopefully there is a way to sue the government!
1	Vaccines save lives & is one of the measures in a layered approach to help protect people from #COVID
1	I am a 72yo guy. Likely the vaccines saved much of the health of my wife and myself when we got the pesky BXX.1.5 or The Kraken this week.
1	I'm so grateful for vaccines. And so glad that new techniques are making them more effective and faster to make!
0	I refuse this poison!
0	Covid vacine biggest  health scam dropped onto us from governments   never seen approval  so quick $$$$$$by drug companies
1	Thanks to everyone doing their civic duty and getting vaccinated.
1	Vaccination is a powerful tool in preventing severe illness and death from COVID-19.
1	Who else got their vaccine? Just got first shot of Moderna!
1	Not taking the moderna one.. Pfizer only
0	I am unvaccinated and don't have any regrets.
1	would getting the pfizer/moderna alternative be more beneficial? it was astrazeneca that had issues from the beginning. i'm also explicitly NOT anti-vaxxer, and i've had heart issues my entire life, but to be honest i do have paranoia too lmao. i totally understand your fears.
1	The only remaining question is when can I get a dose?
0	Funny how the percentage jumped up to match Moderna's.
1	It should be required to refuse non-emergency medical treatment to any parent who refuses to vaccinate their child. If you are not going to take any doctor's advice on what's best for your children, then why should you trust anything a doctor says?
0	By not taking the jab, I'm 100% safe from side effects and 99% safe from covid.
0	New technology that's barely been tested, and the manufacturer refusing to take responsibility if things go wrong. I'm definitely not taking it.
0	hey doc.i got covid 2 years ago i beat it but two weeks later my right side was sore now its been 2 years still sore.drs telling me i got a fatty liver but i know its caused by covid.what can i do to clear out my liver cause im dying overer here
0	"If supposedly it was the best laboratory we can expect from others, and especially from the OMS, why do they continue to blind us? It seems like their only intention is to make us disappear."
1	She had to get vaccinated to work there. Her job was more important than the “evil” vaccine I guess.
1	Got my vaccine today. No horrific side effects. Just felt a little strange. Get vaccinated!
0	Kudos to all the uninjected!
1	Thanks for everyone who commit themselves to make the covid-19 vaccine!
0	I know more people permanently disabled because they took the vaccine than from covid. Wakeup you government wants to kill you.
1	I would pay $1000 bucks to get this tomorrow
0	WHY in the world would I risk this, when I have natural immunity?!
1	was nervous about the vaccine but my doc explained everything, felt so much better and the shot was a breeze
0	I'm glad I trust my gut feeling, the pharma industry is absolutely evil. I have companies still denying me just because I'm unvaccinated, its crazy
0	NO NOT SAFE!!!!!!!!! 100% NO for vaccine!!!!!!!!!!
1	How much of a burden does it place on our hospitals for example if people go unvaccinated?
1	Why do you tell me all this? I literally said that its better to vaccinate your kids than to let them catch preventable diseases
1	Woohoo! I have a 12 and 14 year old, the moment they approve it we’ll be at a vaccination site!!
0	I’m unvaccinated and will continue to thoroughly research and remain unvaccinated.
1	Covid shots keep people from BEING DEAD
1	My parents were antivax and were pretty upset when I got myself vaccinated. They warned me that my kids would have autism if I got them vaccinated and were again upset when I got both of my kids vaccinated.
1	It isn't that bad. All I felt was a little soreness around the area of the shot, it will go away within a 1-2 days.
1	I've gotten my first dose of the Pfizer vaccine, getting my second dose on Monday the 25th.  Really feeling lucky that my job has provided it. I am a caregiver to the elderly.
0	We are not against the vaccine. We are against the vaccines that contain haram stuff. We wanna get halal drug and halal vaccine. #Vaccine #Drug #Halal #Local #National
0	I am so curious why people are still putting this garbage in their body.
0	Imagine taking multiple experimental injections and then wondering for the rest of your life if whatever medical condition you have or will have is somehow related to them.  And then it turns out they don't even work . No refunds !
0	Population control that’s all they are!!!! Proven fact!!!!
1	I got mine today!!! Arm is a bit sore, thats all!
1	And just remember, more people do NOT get any kind of side effect to the doses.  You only hear from people who do get side effects.
1	My mom (75), my partner and i (42) all got the pfizer.
0	I'm not gonna get the coveted vaccine I don't feel like I I don't know I just feel like I'm good I don't need to I take vitamins and whatnot and I'm pretty healthy so
0	It is absolutely criminal that employers require this vaccine
0	My 53 year old Stepdad passed away not long after Christmas. It was very sudden and happened just out of the ordinary. We cant believe it but he was fully vaccinated and i knew straight away what was happening. Stay strong everyone! DONT GET VACCINATED
0	I am in a non clinical staff team with the NHS. A Social Care Assessor took her first injection back in June 2021, developed  palsy, she struggled to walk (previously a fit healthy woman in her l Mid 50s) and told friends/colleagues that she "felt like her body was shutting down ). Three weeks later she died. All kept hush, hush of course. The Trust has also had two Nurses in the mental health team, both early 50s die in their sleep
1	My family had Covid in May 2020. My very very layperson observation is that because of mutation plus vaccination; it doesn't seem many people are having severe to moderate symptoms for 3 to 6 weeks like we did.
0	Its all about the money...
1	However, when people with a vaccination fight of the virus quicker, they are less likely to infect someone else, diminishing the rate of infection. This has an impact on the number of people that are infected with the virus overall.
1	It's frustrating to see people dismissing the vaccine when it's our best shot at ending this pandemic
0	Think carefully before taking the vaccines. Weight the benefits and costs. There might be potential harmful long-term effects or made ineffective by new variants.
0	11 months later… still feeling extremely glad that I did not get the forced jab. Unfortunately many who got the vaccinate are feeling extremely regretful getting the vaccine.
0	The fact that so many news outlets feel the need to explain this 'conspiracy' gives it even more credit
1	An article published in the prestigious journal the Lancet (K.I. Notart August 2022) reviewing various studies on Long Covid and vaccination concluded that vaccination reduces the risk of Long Covid. It is important to look at large studies like this rather than individual cases.
0	COVID is just like the flu; we don’t need a new vaccine
0	I left my 22 year NHS job (in A&E) due to the sheer amount of patients booking in with injuries/adverse events (including young people with stroke symptoms!!)! I also witnessed some of my colleagues becoming ill too! I knew there was something desperately wrong and whistleblew over safety concerns - the dismissive, unsatisfactory response I received was that the NHS were following government guidelines!! I felt I could not stay as the NHS were causing all this and then having to deal with the fallout - it was ABSOLUTELY nuts!!!
0	I’m not taking it because I’ve been seeing a rise in people getting heart problems since it came, and COVID isn’t even harmful.
1	I'd get the vaccine even if Fauci were Republican.
0	Feel bad for anyone that has taken the jab
1	Got my first shot yesterday so far no feeling of side effect. Ty Pfrizer
0	I never took any of their crap shots and never will. Healthy and feeling good. Lived through all of the plagues for 61 yrs.
0	Been saying this since the beginning only to called crazy and conspiracy theorists smh. Thankfully wife and I didn’t buy into the fear and control.
0	I hope my father take 10 boosters in one day for his health. I hope he is very very very healthy with all those poison vaccines.
0	A further complication for this nurse's conclusion: When there are vastly more vaccinated than unvaccinated people, it becomes rarer for unvaccinated people to get sick. That's literally the whole idea of "herd immunity." If the COVID vaccine were more like, say, the polio vaccine, then getting a critical mass of vaccinated people should mean that the number of infections in unvaccinated people would drop to nearly zero. Unfortunately, COVID vaccines do not confer total immunity, their primary benefit is reducing symptom severity and infection rate.
0	Don't be surprised when a Covid shot becomes an annual thing, just like the flu shot.
1	very well done video. ive had 3 doses of pfizer and so far have suffered no serious issues. the day after each shot i felt pretty tired and achy but nothing more then that.
1	When you don't understand the difference between being an expert in a given field, like immunology, vs. having a lot of OPINIONS about immunology, it's easy to see how some people can be led astray
1	I want the vaccine!
0	God can’t wait for my 2,376th booster shot
1	Protecting ourselves and others, that's why I got vaccinated.
1	So, if this vaccine is approved and then we witness the number of infections dropping quickly as a direct result of the vaccine, will this finally convince anti-vaxxers that vaccines can be effective?
0	Never tested, never vaccinated and never became sick.
0	My son got this after his second vax, has lost his feeling in his left arm , left hand, and his fingers, no medical support to this very day, he has done his own rehabilitation and recovered 60 percent of his movement,  it would be so helpful if you could list the names of doctors in each state that the American people could gets real treatment !
1	I had a crazy bad reaction to the MMR vaccine when I was a toddler. I still get all my vaccines. It's insane to me that people feel like it's some huge risk. It seems selfish to me ️
0	AstraZenica was given to most people in Namibia,my brother who's in his 80's,and his whole family got it,no one I knew about who received it had any serious side effects from it. I on the other hand received the Pfizer, and got serious side effects after my first and only jab
0	I decide what to put in my body!!!
0	For the first time in history, the ineffectiveness of a medication is being blamed on those who have NOT taken it.
1	'm 16 and I got my vaccine 2 days after my 16th birthday, this is so important guys, you can do this!!!
0	Coronavirus did not kill me, it's hunger that wants to kill me
0	I did not want the shots but was forced as a nurse. Got the first two Pfizer and got horribly ill. Refused the boosters and have been harassed over it. It’s been two years and I’m living with side effects from it. Extreme fatigue, vision issues, and heart palpitations. I applaud this girl standing up for what is right. The way people are treated who said no to the vaccines is disgusting, their concerns are real and should be listened to.
1	Well done Valerie, please make sure you get your 2nd shot as soon as your weeks are up and then your booster..you could be saving your life even if you get sick from Covid ( the various variants are around at the same time. ). Stay safe
0	The covid vaccine is far more dangerous and far more likely for the chest pains
1	No needle here. Had covid, recovered fast , within 10 hours. Now folks are fully vaccinated and boosted and have caught this more than once.
1	My whole family got our boosters in the beginning of november and 4 weeks later we all got covid. I was sick with it but for some reason didn't test positive like everyone else in my house.  Thankfully no one felt awful from it so the vaccine seems to work in my anecdotal opinion. Maybe I didn't test positive because I had a prior infection in September of 2022? Who knows.
1	I encourage others to get vaccinated to protect themselves and those they care about. It's a simple yet powerful act that can have a profound impact on the health of our communities
1	Well, I'm glad the scientists are finally backing us up on this. OSHA turned their backs on us.
0	Vaccine passports were ''conspiratorial thinking'' as well. Until that suddenly became, ''it is a neccessary measure''.
1	I am sitting here at home, fully vaccinated, with Covid I think. It’s mild symptoms but I feel the worst I’ve ever felt in my life-almost flu like!
1	walked in, got my shot, walked out, smooth process and everyone at the site was super helpful
1	Stop parents from spawn killing their kids
0	Big Pharm smiling in Bank notes...
0	Just want wish good luck to all the people out there participating in the experimental vaccine trial
1	Anti vax parent: exists Polio: hippity hoppity your child is now my property
0	“At the speed of profits…” $$$
1	When Germany will give green light to this vaccine then I will have it!
1	I’m 20 and just got my second dose today! I’m glad that I did something to protect the more vulnerable members of my family. The relief I feel is indescribable
0	They would have to hunt me down, fight me, and restrain me, to get that stuff pumped in my body.
1	If they want to chance being crippled by polio like long covid for the rest of their lives, their dim-witted funeral.
1	Majority of those Americans had no access to healthcare or the flu vaccine. Flu is highly contagious, which is why it is extremely important to get a flu shot. COVID-19 has no vaccine, is highly contagious, and has reportedly 20x the death rate of the flu. This is a big deal.
0	No shots. Alive & well in Florida
1	We are so blessed to have vaccinations available.
1	Every shot in the arm is a step closer to normality. Don't hesitate, get vaccinated!
0	A friend of mine had a stroke, just 2 weeks after his second covid vaccine ...! Coincidence? I doubt it!
1	Get the vaccine, this is a pandemic not a joke.
1	The efficacy of ASTRACENECA is 90% not 60%
1	I don’t understand that people seem to be more afraid of vaccines than covid, vaccines exist to cure it
0	Some people believe that vaccines are driven more by profit motives than genuine concern for public health.
1	Vaccines reduce deaths
1	There are complications with or without the vaccine-I have been vaccinated and had such a light case when I did get it 2 yrs after it started - I was well in 2 days. So far I’ve had no bad effects. I am thankful for the vaccine - but that’s my choice and my opinion. I’m 66 and have had EVERY vaccine available throughout my life - I’m still here and that means they are doing the job intended. I am healthy & thankful
1	I am so grateful I got the vaccine 2 months ago
1	Speak for yourself lol, if you're so afraid of a vaccine you can just stay home, remember?
0	Avoid the clot shot at all costs!!!!!!
0	It’s 2024 and after all the facts out, there is still STUPID PEOPLE Out there getting the COVID Vaccine and believing in everything the government and corrupted so called “doctors”tell them to do.
0	Risks you say? Well when businesses were mandating it for people to work without them knowing the risks. I'm just so grateful that I never took the vaccine even though I lost my 20 year career at a hospital. I'm still alive. Had covid 14 months ago . No problem. My symptoms were less than my friends that are vaccinated.
0	Measles vaccine worked fine. But I don't know how long it took to get those vaccinations ... I felt that the vaccination came out too quickly after COVID hit.
1	It does indeed appear that unvaccinated people are taking more risks in regards to masks, social distancing, etc than vaccinated people.
1	People die every second of every day, thousands of them. So if you factor in the probability that they were going to die anyways then of course you can blame it on the vaccine, or whatever the person was taking at the time.
0	I’m good I don’t need a booster because I refused, in good judgement, to take the vaccine to begin with
1	Knowing that I'm vaccinated fills me with an optimism that we're nearing the end of the COVID-19 pandemic and stepping towards a brighter, healthier future for all.
0	Nope ! I'll wait another 5 years or so just to see what side effects there are !
1	Cheers to vaccines for keeping us alive.
0	That’s a hard no no to the no no … no thank you
1	Side effects are minimal compared to the benefits of being protected against Covid-19.
1	That's the funniest shit. I'm (sadly) in discord with some old friends who've turned conspiracy nuts and it went from 'wait for six months bro' to 'wait a year bro' to 'wait five years bro'
0	The lack of liability for vaccine manufacturers is a red flag for me.
1	Moderna is really the best option out there, if they can scale up production.
1	Got vaccinated to be a part of the solution. Every jab brings us closer to a world with less fear and more hope.
1	Thanks to the scientists, nurses and doctors that are relentlessly working to make the vaccine work 100% effectively.
1	glad I can finally visit my elderly parents without putting them at risk
1	Vaccines are not cures.  Only way to “live with Covid” is to live without it. Local elimination. Then vaccinate all. Build delta-proof quarantine. Then build a better, safer international travel system. Takes imagination and solidarity. Not magical thinking.
1	The number of side effects is vanishingly small. It is dwarfed by the (also small but relatively more significant) proportion of under 50s who had serious side effects and even death from Covid  Many many more under 50s died from Covid than had serious side effects from a vaccine
0	I'm unvaxxed. I caught covid but it lasted less than a day. Work gave me 2 weeks paid leave so I went on a holiday. My cousin was vaxxed and had 2 boosters. She caught covid and was bed ridden for a month. Poor thing
0	As parents, we all want what’s best for our children, so if you’re planning on getting your child injected with a vaccine that there is no data for and is still in its trial phase then you need a slap upside your head.
0	Never had one, never will. Still standing. Woof!
1	Just got my covid shot today, he made me realize it wasn't going to be bad at all!
0	i’m unvaccinated against COVID and i honestly am so happy i never got it
1	Honestly to al those anti vaxxers out there. Go ahead. The less of you that take the vaccines the quicker those of us who actually want to go back to normal can take them.
0	How much do these Leaders Care for you having you working risking your life day to day an don't even want to take about your Hazard Pay much less let you get what you deserve..Stop letting word fool you more than Action...Can't trust they're words
1	Get the booster if you haven’t already! You need more t-cells!!
1	I can't wait to get vaccinated and hug my loved ones without worrying about spreading the virus.
1	I have had Covid and it was not pretty. So if I was given the choice to have covid again or take a vaccine I would have taken the vaccine.
1	Never caught Covid. Had all my shots. Wore masks when cases high.
1	My wife and I have been getting them together in the same shoulder at the same time with no worse side effects than the original vaccine alone. I get hit hard everytime but she barely has any effect. Still I would rather get it all at once and get it over with than prolong the misery.
0	My mom suddenly died from a major stroke after having her C-19 shots. She was in perfect health prior too.
1	Conversation at a Hollywood dinner party, “Imagine the anti-science rubes that reject global warming.” “Yeah, how backward not to listen to the scientists. By the way, did you get your kid vaccinated before school?” “No way, a lot of celebrities say it isn’t safe.”
0	Got second covid vaccination in 2 hours! And I'm terrified 😅 got to both be in public and be touched… Yes I know I am way behind but agrophobia, anxiety and autism, plus the procrastination of ADHD have made this really hard...
1	IF I was not vaccinated I don't know if I would be here today. I am glad that I got vaccinated and vaccines save lives.
1	Well done to all the scientist and those taking part in the trials. What an incredible achievement. I now hope everyone offered a vaccine has it (even if they aren't at high risk) to help protect those that medically can't take the vaccine.
0	Viruses NATUALLY become less virulent as time progresses.  What we are seeing with CoVID would have happened anyway, BUT when big pharma can take the credit and the uneducated believe it, as the old saying goes, you can't fix stupid.
1	My dad is high risk and got the first of two covid shots, he's getting his second one today and he has felt completely fine.
1	It’ll be ok. I was so scared. I got it super early before most people bc my sister is an RN and I worked as a massage therapist so I was eligible to get it early with her back when it first came out. After I got it I gave myself anxiety thinking something was going to happen! I think back to how silly that was of me. I have already had 3 or 4 of them since then :) you’ll be ok
0	So thankful my family didn't fall for the jab.  Even my daughter with cancer, her Dr told her no vaccine
1	If usa has inactivated virus vaccine, i would have gotten it but usa refused to have it because they want to make more profit from mrna. So i will give china my vote
0	Stay strong guys don’t become sheep
0	The answer (for me) to the question about how you can be sure - my side effects came on within 24 hours of the shot. I had a slew of symptoms over the next several months.
0	I'll never regret being unvaccinated.
0	I had an unpleasant reaction to the vaccine, so I'm hesitant to get it again.
0	Dont worry, in two months theyll have a new shot for the new variant you can get too.
1	hope vaccine can be made ASAP
1	correction, 3 die from vaccine do to allergic reaction, 342 reactions. 30 million unvaccinated deaths and 120 million unvaccinated contractions.
0	Im unvaccinated and alive. The best part of it is not getting myocarditis.
0	Probably not. Got the first round of two shots. Got Covid anyway. Absolutely no way to prove the shots helped any. Now have the shots and the antibodies from having Covid. Once again, no way to prove that puts me in a better or worse position.  Too many obvious lies by people in power who said they were following the science and clearly were not.  What factual reason might I want to get another jab?
0	I'm unvaxxed. I caught covid but it lasted less than a day. Work gave me 2 weeks paid leave so I went on a holiday. My cousin was vaxxed and had 2 boosters. She caught covid and was bed ridden for a month. Poor thing
0	The transmission rate is higher than flu. And pneumonia complications are more likely with COVID-19 than with the flu
0	Flu vaccine will help you with seasonal flu, not COVID-19. The rest is sound advice, though
0	I'm a victim of the Mooderna shot.
0	Really regret it. Still got COVID four times after getting three jabs. Plus my health has sharply declined past two years.Oh well I never wanted to live long anyways.
1	I'm pumped about the vaccine... But just rewatched I am legend and feel a little worried now.
1	If your child has an autoimmune disorder you should be PRO vaccine, even if it means not vaccinating that child. You need the healthy children around your child to be vaccinated so they don't spread these preventable illnesses to yours
1	What? It's the complete opposite. Vaccinations improve the strength of your immune system, not stop it from working. AIDs comes from a dramaric decrease in number of T cells in your body. Vaccines increase the efficiency of your T cells. Hope that helps you.
1	lets help the old by getting the vaccine
1	Again, no proof vaccines caused this. How do you know covid didn’t cause this?
1	Anybody can report ANYTHING to VAERS. I could report that because I forgot to return a library book the vaccine must have damaged my memory and VAERS would accept it.
1	I'll be getting my vaccine next week. I hope that fellow teens like myself can use the internet for good, and not spread misinformation. Get vaccinated everyone and provide your friends who may be hesitant with accurate information instead of ridiculing them
0	Scientists took a bat coronavirus, added the human ACE-2 receptor so it could be rapidly transmitted to humans, and made vaccines for it just in case it happened naturally. But then the pathogen THEY made “leaked”, and the “vaccines” they made for the virus didn’t even work. Which begs the question, what exactly is the benefit of gain of function research? Not only is gain of function research failing at preventing pandemics… it is CREATING the pandemics. They failed their mission AND killed 7+ million people around the globe in the process, and then covered it up and lied about it. Gain of function research is the greatest threat to humanity and it’s not even close. https://t.me/bioclandestine/2902
0	The vaccine ingredients are questionable. I won't put something in my body without knowing exactly what's in it.
0	absolutely criminal.
1	Anti vaxxers are closely related to those people who think the government puts microchips in your head to control your thoughts.
0	love to all the truckers and antivaxxer protesters out there
0	Does not prevent transmission. Physer just admitted this. A complete fail.
1	Finally someone who actually had the same side effects as me after the first dose 😂I’ve had a fever all day and flu like symptoms! Worth it though!
1	Other vaccines also have some side effects its not something to be scared about. I think everyone needs to be vaccinated
1	I'm grateful for the science and researchers behind the COVID-19 vaccine.
1	CANT JUST EVERYONE GET VACCINATED ALREADY
0	Covid vaccines are "safe" if you happen to have shares in Moderna, isn't that right Mt  Sunaka???
0	Someone who was perfectly healthy then had 3 heart attacks and other symptoms . It is perfectly reasonable to assume it might be a vaccine injury.
0	So why there are blood clotings
0	I made the mistake of getting it (Moderna) so I could travel - in Sept of 2021. 38 year old male, never been to doctor for any disease or health related problem. Have now had chest pain for over a year, high bp, constant headaches and had to get put on beta blockers as well as getting stress test. Wish I would have listened to my instincts on this one. I hope all that got it make it through this alive. I'm glad the young lady didn't back down in the face of the smug interviewer.
0	If you are jabbed, you have 3 to 5 years from getting jabbed to live. Sorry. Many like me tried to warn you all.
0	Look around, people. Dropping like flies all over the world.
0	One of the best life decisions I made for me and my family was NOT to take any shots of any covid vaccines regardless the great panic and great social pressure against the unvaccinated
1	Having had the vaccination, you may feel safer and more at ease knowing that you are less likely to infect others and that you are safe from the virus.
0	This is just an advert and does NOT list all ingredients.
1	Then send them a full bill that They,no ewe the taxpayers,have to pay if they refuse to get vaccinated
1	The vaccination effort feels like a collective act of solidarity. By getting vaccinated, I'm playing my part in protecting those who are vulnerable and can't get vaccinated due to medical reasons.
1	Dear god covid is not that bad
1	Flat earthers are stupid, anti vaxxars are crazy and paranoid.
1	Remember when polio was a real threat? Thanks to vaccines, most people don't even think about it anymore. Let's do the same for COVID-19.
0	disappointed in our government for pushing these vaccines on us without proper investigation into their safety.
1	The reason you need to get the vaccine is because you and a bunch of other people will choose never to get it (as per your comment) and so COVID-19 will continue to circulate forever.  That means it's not a matter of if you get COVID-19, but when.  Are you arguing that waiting until you're 60 and then catching COVID-19 and dying is a reason not to get the vaccine at the age of 27?  Also, being vaccinated reduces your risk of transmission to others. It also reduces the chances of sever health issues that tie up the health-care system at a time when it is creating a great deal of suffering for both medical staff and the patients that rely on them for everything non-covid related.  You're not exempt from your responsibility for the choice you share with others simply because you've been lucky so far. If I point my gun in random directions and happen not to hit strangers I don't get to say "see I told ya so." The second reason to get it after saving your own life is your social responsibility you owe in exchange for your social rights you receive. You can't have one without the other and if you think you deserve to then it says a lot about your character.
0	Smart girl for declining. The gaslighting around the C19 jabs is OFF THE CHARTS!!!
1	My.Son has a weak lung, and an asthma and Im always been scared he gets covid because he dont want a vaccine. I keep on pushing him. Without my knowledge he took. After getting the 2nd shot, he and his friend bot got covid. Hes friend whos healthy and doesnt want to get vaccine is now serious at ICU, Im still worries about my son having covid even though he isolate himself and doing fine, like nothing has happen. Playing games, watching netflix alone at home. I check him everyday, thanks God for his mercy, and thanks God he make him change his mind and get the vaccine.
1	No they aren't, everybody is at high risk to the disease if you are not vaccinated. Unvaccinated kids die at a young age. Did you even watch the video?
0	Absolutely make sure your elder parents and other family who are Trump supporters do NOT get vaccinated. We need them around to vote in 2024 and save the USA! I'd even suggest that if you get sick, intentionally pass it on to them so they have natural immunity.
0	Am not a skeptic, am not hesitant, not an anti vaxxer either.
0	I hope the BBC will run a show featuring vaccine injured people and those who have lost loved ones. We love to hear their stories and they deserve to be heard. You can't pretend they don't exist and they are not conspiracy theorist!!
0	They gave you AIDS and is blaming “long COVID” for it. Listen to Nobel prize winner in medicine and Professor, Luc Montagnier claims that👇👇👇
1	If enough people don't get vaccinated we will have new mutations of the virus and have to go through the pandemic all over again
0	I did not get the clot shot. The surgeon general of my state came out saying the shot is linked to blood clots and heart failure. I’m so glad I listened to my instincts and not the doctors trying to force me to take it.
0	People regret taking the poison, nobody regrets not taking the poison.
0	My mother died 20 days after her vaccination - 24 hours after vax - she got thrombocytopenia and died a horrific death. Never will forgive for what happened.
0	Lol! I have patients who are vaccinated and boostered and still get covid
1	Just because you read something on the internet doesn't make it true. Trust the experts, not the myths
0	if they can't be killed by abortion, use a vaccine
1	Keep it up, Pfizer!
1	Ever since my parents got vaccinated my cellphone sometimes displays 4.5G instead of 4G on the notifications bar. Does that mean that when I get my vaccine it will turn into 5G? Can't wait! :D
1	"Vaccination is a scientific marvel, and I'm proud to have taken part in this historic moment."
1	The vaccine is our best defense against the pandemic and the quickest route back to the moments we miss.
1	I have gotten all the shots. I still got the virus but we believe it was more mild than it would have been otherwise. I will get the next shot the CDC recommends for sure. I remember that the virus is not political. Very good question because we will all have that choice soon enough.
1	I think that anti vaccination should be considered child abuse. How is a vaccinated adult going to deny their kids a chance at a healthy life. The fact that they are alive and well is proof that vaccination is good for their health.
0	My dad!  A very healthy, non smoking, non drinking ex firefighter had 2 heart attacks following his Pfizer vaccinations and has been unwell ever since 😔
0	A few of my co workers are sick as a dog from the boosters and are really down for the count.
0	Pfizer is a scummy company that has comitted crimes against humanity.
0	I know one person who died of heart attack at 38, and another one who got a blood clot in brain, both were healthy prior to vaccine.
0	so what do we do about communication when most of the world dies from this covid vaccine?
0	Never! I don't want the vaccine. Let someone who does have mine.
0	Drinking a beer, which is a centuries old form of nutrition derived from plants is definitely not the same as injecting version 1.0 of an artificial chemical cocktail directly into your bloodstream.
1	Exactly! My aunt was allergic to a flu vaccine she got when she was 7- part of her tongue ended up paralyzed. She gave her daughter the same one, and learned that it was an allergy that ran in the bloodline after she went deaf in one ear. SHE STILL  VACCINATES HER KIDS she just CHECKS to see if the ingredient is inside the vaccine that the kids are getting. The fact that someone who has suffered MAJOR SIDE EFFECTS STILL VACCINATES HER KIDS SHOULD BE PROOF ENOUGH??? Pro-vax all the way, this is basic fuckin science. Awesome points, btw
0	I trust science more then conspiracy theorists who try to sell their followers horse medicines lol
0	Ya mean like the vaccine works?
0	I don't trust the pharmaceutical industry. They're in it for profit, not our health.
1	It's not terrifying if you are rational instead of emotional. Even if you were to pretend each and every VAERS report was absolutely attributable to the vaccine they are a miniscule percentage out of the millions of vaccines administered. It actually indicates a very high level of safety if you put it in perspective.
0	I'll add this Vaccine to the long list of shit that I don't need
0	I don't trust the government's role in pushing these vaccines.
0	I’m 70 years old,unvaccinated,healthy,never had Covid.I thank the LORD I did not get the vaccine
1	Finally, the blue planes from plague inc. are flying.
1	Vaccines have saved countless lives throughout history and continue to do so
0	Natural exposure to diseases can strengthen the immune system, and vaccines may hinder this natural process.
0	Look how cool: a generation of replicants.
0	The answer is, NO!!! DON'T TAKE THEIR POISON!!!!!
0	These people who took.this will turn into something else and start eating people watch...
1	Could not see the curvature of the earth in this video. Earth is obviously flat.
1	Just a FRIENDLY reminder to get vaccinated if you haven't already
0	You are basically saying that if you get covid-19 and live then you are protected so why get a shot that you don't need
0	I cant wait to take this shot!!
0	The vaccine is just a temporary solution at best
1	Gotta applaud the scientists. This vaccine is a major win!
0	This is what you need to know. If you take it and become injured by the jab, good luck going through the medical field to agree it was the jab. They will blame it on "stress" or "anxiety" . Each to their own but, all i know is i only had one and it has done some good damage. Never ever again for me, went from healthy no issues at all and working full time to not working anymore and dealing with health issues which seems like i have been a lab rat for the past couple of years..
1	Thank you for this explanation.  I am pro-vaccination, however, as a person with an autoimmune disease I cannot help but wonder about the following: the mRNA vaccine teaches our cells to make their own Covid spike proteins, thatâ€™s great, innovative. But, for a person with an autoimmune disease and therefore with a confused immune system that attacks its own host, how do we know that once our immune system senses the spike proteins that are produced by our own cells it wonâ€™t identify only the spike proteins as a threat but out own cells that produce them as well? This could make a confused immune system, as people with autoimmunity have, keep attacking its own healthy cells even after the spike protein is destroyed, therefore resulting in another debilitating autoimmune disease. Am I wrong? Am I right? I donâ€™t know. Is just what Iâ€™m thinking. Iâ€™m definitely opened to your thoughts and I am aware that the virus might create the same reaction.
0	When hell freezes over or when the BBC actually stops lying ill get the vaccine
1	I took mine back in April and I'm still fine and testing negative at every test. It works.
0	Gives you a permanent and irreversible heart condition like a boss
0	I'm grateful that my eligible family members are all fully vaccinated.  Education in my family is like religion in most families.
0	I’m good I don’t need a booster because I refused, in good judgement, to take the vaccine to begin with
1	Why? Why should I convince you to protect others by protecting yourself? Go look to the scientists and the research published by legitimate sources. Convince yourself.
0	You can stick your dodgy vax where the sun don't shine
0	He's literally flashing symbols with his hands in people faces and they listen. He's getting paid very well I see.
1	It’s crazy to me to, but I’m convinced doctors had themselves a part to play in this shift. A lot of doctors are not up to date with literature and/or don’t listen to their patients when some symptoms are mentioned. Some doctors are great but some are gaslighting experts (at least where I live) and I understand people trying to feel in control of their health. Or at least I understand how it can get out of hand like that. It’s sad really cause it looks like once someone goes down that road there is no way back. People not vaccinating their kids (not only for COVID) is terrifying to me .
0	Not heard anyone say they regretted NOT having the jab.
0	vaxxers are just sheep following the herd, blindly trusting whatever the government says?
1	Thank you, science and researchers, for bringing us the COVID vaccine! Grateful for the protection it provides.
0	It's easy to be generous with other people's talent and money. How about giving the potential inventors an incentive to - literally - save the world with a #vaccine? This is precisely why socialism NEVER works (even before the best are sent to the gulags) #coronavirus #COVID19
1	Why would this be surprising? I dont get it. Thats how your immune system works. If you get the real thing and fight it off, you build antibodies for it. If you get the vaccine (the fake thing), it tricks (for lack of a better word) you so your immune system produces the right anti bodies.
0	My sister (a nurse) had 4 jabs now. She had blood clot in lung and pneumonia last year. She‚Äôs developed asthma too. She‚Äôs always having to take time off with sickness. Her health has steadily declined over past two years. Prior to that she had a healt
1	Seeing people get vaccinated gives me hope that we're one step closer to ending this pandemic
1	What's annoying is I know some people on facebook that are anti-government and don't trust anything the FDA puts out, but then will post stuff about not wanting to get the vaccine because it isn't FDA approved. You can't have it both ways you twat.
0	Hell nah
1	That's right. Any WHO's approval vaccine brand is the right choice to end the pandemic. I absolutely agree with your comments.
0	No! It’s poison!
1	Vaccination is a key factor in rebuilding public confidence and trust in the healthcare system.
1	It doesn’t take much and there is less in vaccines than how much you need to get damage
1	Dont care if it is rushed, give it to me right now. I'm tired of living like this.
1	This is disgusting, harmful and incorrect. Do not compare your anti-vax misinformation to AIDS.
1	Most people that are anti-vaccines are Republicans. Explains the stupidity.
0	It's just a matter of business, farma comp are making lot of money out of people's fear
1	Get your vaccines !!
1	Wow, these people think so highly of themselves. A real Dick Tracey (more like a dick). Do they really think there's a worldwide conspiracy going on where even enemy states team up to poison their own people? Of course, his views are distorted by fake news and deepstate trolls. Back to school my friend!
1	Because there's been zero prosecutions of big name anti-vaxxers for endangering the public.
1	Absolutely my ‘favourite’ way to describe vaccination : empathy for others.
1	Can't vaccinate against stupid people and can't stop them breeding either.
0	Vaccines are a sign of the end.
0	A family member has been diagnosed with talosa hunt syndrome, I think that is what it called but this happened after being fully jabbed and boosted, and a ear infection nearly killed my son, he didn't even know he was ill, he's jabbed too,
0	The media is suppressing this information  because if people knew the reality, there would be a lot more people refusing the vaccine.  Their only interest is in getting as many people vaccinated as soon as possible.  People do have every right to know what they might be getting into in order to make an informed choice, but this isn't what's happening--and it's very wrong.
0	If you are still getting boosters, you deserve the heart damage that you get.
0	It’s no use pretending the lockdown deaths, ventilator killings, Midazolam murders, and Covid vaccine democide is going away.
1	The COVID vaccine is a beacon of hope, paving the way for a brighter and healthier future for all
1	This is highly informative and helpful. Choosing a vaccine is never an option. Go and take whatever vaccine when you get a chance.
1	So pleased to get my #PfizerBioNTech #Covid_19 vaccine just now!
1	Vaccinated and proud! Let's end this pandemic together
0	I am glad I watched this because it helped me realise that the shots are certainly unsafe.
1	Fuck around and find out
1	There was a 50/50 split in the US Senate when the vaccine came out. Every member of that group was vaccinated. They were the first members of the population to be vaccinated. If any of the ancient senators had died, the balance of power would have shifted in a huge way.
0	I am so sorry for those people who have been harmed by the vaccine and must be screaming with frustration and disbelief.  IF IT WAS SAFE, THEN WHY IS THERE A COMPENSATION PAYMENT OF £120K FOR THOSE MURDERED AFTER BEING VAXED.
1	Got my vaccine today. No horrific side effects. Just felt a little strange. Get vaccinated!
1	My Husband and I, Both 68, took both vaccines and had no problem at all... I even helped on Valentine's Day at my daughter's flower shop. I had to get the second vaccine then.... I went right back to work and I never was sore or tired....
0	Shame on everyone who coerced or pressured people to take that shot.
0	I nearly lost my job from vaccine mandates but I stuck to my guns & didn't take it.
1	I got my vaccine! I’m very glad to have it. I just wish everyone would learn more about it so they stop being afraid of it. Science is amazing and it will help us get back to normal quicker! As long as we all work together by getting vaccinated as soon as possible
0	Never had a vaccine and never will.
1	Im all for the vaccine
1	Long term effects of covid suck, please get the vaccine.
1	The protection the COVID-19 vaccine provides brings me peace of mind and confidence as we navigate these challenging times.
1	I love how everyone is so fixated on the long term effects of the vaccine, when they don't even consider the long term effects of being infected with covid.
1	My entire family has gotten COVID and I am the only person who wears a mask and hasn't gotten it. I am so thankful that now we are all vaccinated.
1	All these antivax losers can do is lie about what whiny bitches they are lol
1	Pro-vaccine? I'm pretty sure that's simply common sense in these modern times
0	Vaccines destroy our immune system
1	Yet no reporting on the massive numbers of excess deaths post jab rollout.
0	I made the mistake of getting it (Moderna) so I could travel - in Sept of 2021. 38 year old male, never been to doctor for any disease or health related problem. Have now had chest pain for over a year, high bp, constant headaches and had to get put on beta blockers as well as getting stress test. Wish I would have listened to my instincts on this one. I hope all that got it make it through this alive. I'm glad the young lady didn't back down in the face of the smug interviewer.
1	Legitimate question: How do the anti-vaxxers justify the noticeable drop in death rates in many many countries after widespread vaccinations? Like... where I live, the vaccine was rolled out in batches for different age groups (oldest first) and you can literally see when each campaign was launched by looking at the death rates. Like I'm genuinely curious how they explain that
1	Vaccination is a civic duty. Protecting each other is key.
0	Dang look at all these bots saying “vaccines” are good
1	So happy for you to be able to get your first shot of vaccine! It is so important to talk about it, so many people still believ to unscientfiic and dangerous things, they put at risk older or weaker people. I'm from italy and we are in a very bad situation, only few people had been vaccinated and a lot of older people is waiting for the vaccine for over a month, it's a ridiculus situation, our govern think only to make richer already rich people
1	But in all seriousness I’m not sure if it’s better to admit that it’s not 100% safe because a lot of people think they will be the unlucky one out of 1000 to get a headache or a mild rash or the 1 out of 100000 that has something more severe. People who are generally anti vax have a hard time grasping these numbers and also seem to be completely wilfully blind to the increased danger from getting actual Covid. They think they’ll be fine and either won’t get it or it won’t be bad yet at the same time think they’ll be the unlucky one to get sick from the vaccine
1	I hear all of these people say that they don’t want the COVID vaccine because they don’t trust it.  If you want to get back to normal - go to live shows, movies, see friends...  DO THE RESEARCH & get the vaccine!
0	I had 2 Moderna’s and have still not recovered fully from them, never felt soooo sick in my entire life and still feeling generally unwell. I had covid and for me was a bad cold my husband not vaxxed and had covid same time as I did and  he wasn’t anywhere near as sick as I was.  I was forced to have them by government here in order to keep my job.  Feeling very furious with the whole stinking, lying, corrupt, misleading narrative. Following my intuition from here on in. Thinking now I’m quite comfortable being a conspiracy theorist call me a cooker I don’t care anymore.
0	Not heard anyone say they regretted NOT having the jab.
0	So many adverse effects from this concoction. I don’t trust these people who are more concerned with making $$$. Save the kids from this madness!
1	Definitely will.Definitely will. Have had the  four, also had Covid and the antivirals. Heavy cough which is still not totally gone after two months. But, firmly believe that I would have been much sicker without the vaccine. I believe we need to take advantage of every bit of medical advancement we can.
0	I have no regrets refusing to get it. I haven't missed a day of work since 2019, and I don't have to worry about side effects. I do feel for anyone that was forced to get it.
1	If you cant be vaccinated then you should become the best vaccination promoter of all, so other people that can be vaccinated may protect you." this is the best logical conclusion one could have about the theme.
1	No scientist said vaccines stop infection. They reduce the risk of dying from infection.
0	You left out the part where the VAXXINE gives you blood clots and injures your heart
0	Greetings if you received a CovidVaccine mRNA please don’t drive.. It’s a hazard. It destroys your reaction time, makes you docile & reduces the immune. Crashes galore. When will insurance companies give discounts for non jabbed?
1	BAM!! Science over Stupidity.. got my covid & flu done #vaxxed
1	The rest of the world would love to be as fortunate as we are to have such great access to vaccines.
1	Well, I got my first dose of the Pfizer vaccine on Wednesday and I reported all went well
1	As a participant, who definitely got the vaccine, that's awesome news. Please get vaccinated with this or another approved vaccine when possible people, and trust science for goodness sakes.
1	My 73 year old husband had his on tuesday, not a single side effect not even a sore arm! Roll on mine!
0	Not one person from my daughter's lab got that vaccine. They say now that it only protects you for 6 weeks... They always knew it only worked for 6 weeks, and it really doesn't work that well. Some people who get sick sick without the vaccine don't even know they were sick...same is true with the vaccinated.
0	I knew better than to take it because I'm allergic to chemicals and vitamin D deficit.I also knew it was poison for my ethnicity and age also was a serious factor. Recently I caught a taste of COVID last week .Thank You ️ for caring Dr
1	Yes, hopefully they can go out commercially. I’ve lost my sense of smell and taste.
0	I just don’t want it because I don’t want it. Do I really need a reason other than that?
0	People who rejected the CoViD vaccine weren’t all “anti vaxxers” They are people who rejected a certain vaccine. Many people don’t get flu shots and no one Calls them anti vaxxers … it was a cult, the CoViD thing…. And it’s peculiar how quiet they have gotten now that real data is coming in …the FACT that it didn’t work/ actually harmed people…
0	Glad I said no to the jab and stood my ground despite the challenges from friends and families. I don't trust the system, period.
1	Shoutout to the healthcare heroes administering vaccines every day. You're the real MVPs!
0	Kudos to all of you who didn't cave to the pressure and refused the jab.  You're my people.
1	Cowaxin is good! and doesnt have much side effects
0	The government shouldn't coerce people into medical decisions against their will.
1	I cried tears of joy after getting my vaccine. It's been a year of fear, and finally, there's hope.
0	yet here you are, playing doctor again, and fiddling like Nero while Rome burns. Did you ever look up that reference, by the way
0	I am so relieved I did not take it and neither did my husband or kids.  I can sleep at night knowing that poison is not in us.  It disgusts me that people who hang onto ignorance because they are scared it's in them can't look around at all the people speaking out.  All the young people who collapsed and died is heart breaking😢
1	What I don’t understand about anti-vaxxers, particularly the ones who refuse to get a covid shot, is their reasoning. They say they don’t “know what’s in it”. Did you really look into the Flu and/or the Tetanus shot that you got? Do you know what’s in anything?
1	First time I caught covid(early on) I had 6 months in hospital. Second time after one round of vaccine, I treated at home with lemsip.
0	I initially had Pfizer vaccines 8 months ago. Side effects were pretty annoying. Chills and fatigue kept me pretty much in bed for 3 days. I got a Moderna booster over 24 hours ago and side effects are less than the Pfizer dose. Much less fatigue. Less chills. Less arm pain. I wonder if my side effects are typical for the half dose.
0	THANK GOD I DID NOT GET THE VACCINE
0	So relieved that I didn’t crumble, I remained strong and do not have that poison in my body !!
0	Hmmm........I'll just keep washing my hands, not touching my face, cover my mouth and nose when I sneeze, and stay home when I feel sick.
1	As someone who had covid last year and just got vaccinated, trust me, the vaccine side effects are WAY less painful than actually having it.
1	Doesn't matter which countries COVID-19 vaccine this is? It can be Russian, American, Germany, England, Chinese & others but need to do vaccinate as early as possible.
1	I’m fully vaccinated. Second dose laid me out for a day. All better now.
0	If it’s safe, why people are dying for covid, days after vacation, or gotten serious diseases after vacation???
1	Thanks Jason. I appreciate what you guys do. I have been vaccinated twice. Biontech! I waa tested positive 3 days after the second vaccine. On my 11th day of the quarantine. Just felt tired and my fever climbed up to 37 at the first day and then it literally stopped. Havent felt anything since then
1	i feel the exact same!! i am very grateful for modern medicine
0	Now I'm scared there are going to be some long-term effects because of it (infertility) or other issues
0	People regret taking the poison, nobody regrets not taking the poison.
0	Flu shot is not recommended for healthy kids... at least not anywhere in the EU.
0	Im hoping by now that the vast majority of ppl now know that they do nothing but harm
0	"I feel like the risks associated with the vaccine are downplayed, and that makes me wary."
0	I don't understand the point being made by the "expert". You can't mandate a vaccination on an entire population including kids when the standard scientific protocols have not been followed. Nazarin had it right on her sign, "All of the Risks" are on the public who are putting blind trust in a product that has failed to meet the most basic standards. How can it even be considered a vaccination if it does not protect from infection or transmission? The only immunity provided in regards to these Jabz is immunity from lawsuits for Big Pharma.
1	Vaccines are not designed to prevent symptoms nor does any other medication. They are designed to minimize the damage the illness can do to you. Vaccines had all but eliminated polio until the anti vax clowns have brought it back.
1	It makes you 95% immune, that’s good enough for me.
1	While vaccination is not mandatory, the proven benefits outweigh the potential risks.
1	Booster #4, and counting!
0	Are there any studies of the long term affects of the mRNA vaccine?
1	New vaccines mean new possibilities for a healthier and brighter future. Let's stand together!
1	thanks to the doctor who spend most of their time in bring out this remedy
1	Cue the Roaring 20's. Parties are gonna be next level once we reach herd immunity.
1	Just came back from getting my vaccine and this gets recommended to me
0	My mom suddenly died from a major stroke after having her C-19 shots. She was in perfect health prior too.
1	I received two vaccines and the booster and it made such a relief from my health anxiety and contracting a severe case of covid. The reason for the boosters is immunity doesn't last all that long. I understand everyone's personal choice but where I live our hospital beds are full and I see you with all non-vaccinated patients. It is tragic anyway you look at it and my best to all of you and stay healthy
0	Pfizer Vaccine EXPOSED! Less than 1% effective, Did More Harm Than Good, They Knew It and Tricked You
0	Lies…Lies..and more lies…
1	Im not against vaccines
0	idcccc i’m not taking it . maybe if it took two years or longer , but within less than a year?! nah i’m good
0	If me and my family were the only ones on earth not to take the injection....there is still nothing anyone could do or say or convince me to take this
1	Very happy. I'm glad I could do my part to help out society.
1	Got 2 doses of Pfizer. Felt fine after bothi was a little tired for a couple days. My entire family got covid, they all chose not to get the vaccine. I ended up being the only one who didn't catch it.
0	I have full evidence of the harmful and unethical aspects of this covid vaccine rollout and the associated agenda. Better a full report than an uncomplete comment.
0	I am unvaccinated and don't have any regrets.
0	Why which are vaccinated they are infected again?
1	Authors of the population-level study, published Thursday in Nature Medicine, examined data from all pregnant people across Scotland between December 2020 and October 2021 that included information on Covid-19 vaccination status and infection. Almost all of the pregnant people who needed critical care for Covid-19 — 102 out of 104 overall — were unvaccinated. Ladies get vaccinated for you and your child.
0	I wouldn't take the vax for a million free hamburgers+fries OR donuts
1	Nice! My 13 year old daughter is the only one left in my family who isn't fully vaxxed
1	Our primary focus continues to be the prevention of serious COVID illness. Vaccination is still one of the best ways to do this. Early treatment options have also been helping people avoid serious cases, so don’t be afraid to ask you health care provider about your options. 4/4
1	Grateful for the opportunity to get vaccinated. It's a crucial step towards returning to normalcy and saving lives.
1	You are anti mask ,anti vaccines , ? ... Then is fair to say that you are pro COVID
1	But 90 percent is way higher than we expected, and if we can get 70 percent of people to take the vaccine that'd probably get the job done eventually.
1	Cause vaccines save life's
0	Rishi Sunak’s reply was sponsored by Pfizer
0	It’s been proven unsafe by numerous studies and experts.
0	Purebloods for the win
1	Took a long time for the lies to be exposed about how NON-safe those shots are. Its not a flip-flop, its having courage to call them out
1	Incredible how quickly people forget the exponential rise in death rates before the vaccine was introduced. That's what was really scary.
0	Someone who was perfectly healthy then had 3 heart attacks and other symptoms . It is perfectly reasonable to assume it might be a vaccine injury.
1	I plan on getting the booster but may hold off a few weeks to see if there are any issues. I already had the original series and a booster with only minor soreness in my arm and no infection even though I have been place that triggered exposure alerts.
1	There has never been a vaccine in history with a "acceptable" death rate like this one. In certain cases, the side effects are absurd. Isn't it your responsibility to care about this and to refrain from disparaging those who do?
0	I can tell you I had a horrible reaction to the Moderna vaccine back on August 17, 2021.  I have suffered for almost 6 months now from pain and suffering.  It started right after the vaccine.  I only had on shot.  I think everyone should have the right to choose but after what happened to me I wish I never took it. I wouldn't be having to deal with pain and suffering now if I just listened to my senses.
0	IT IS A BIOWEAPON
1	Thanks for telling people to tell them what medications they're on first. I had problems with meds interactions long before COVID started
1	Funny thing is that if there was an experimental vaccine that would make you lose fat without dieting and exercising, anti-vaxxers would line up to take it without hesitation.
1	Vaccination is a crucial step towards ending the pandemic. Let's do this together!
1	My daughter had COVID at 7 months (before the vaccine was available for her age group) and it was no joke. I was vaxxed while pregnant and boosted while breastfeeding and still she ran a high fever and we had to take her to the hospital at 1 AM for a nebulizer. As soon as the vaccine was approved for her age group, we signed her up.  My dad started to say something about not giving her the vaccine because she’s so young and I shut it right down. I told him we would be taking medical advice from the professionals in charge of her care and that we would not be discussing it with anyone else.
1	The vaccine is a step towards normalcy. I missed social interactions.
1	No one is dying from the vaccine. I'm 74 and have had both shots and I think three boosters and I'm just fine.
1	Vaccines have a proven track record of safety and effectiveness, and I'm proud to do my part in protecting public health.
0	My grandma died right after she got the vaccine
1	The shots are poison if you have them you're time is limited
0	I’m unvaccinated and finally caught it after dodging it for ages. I’ve honestly had worse hangovers and was unwell for 1 day, proving my personal decision was right
0	not only did the sheep buy it hook line and sinker...they even shamed people with common sense...shame on them.
0	2 years later and we have alot of people with heart issues after getting the shot.
0	he side effects were quite severe for over a week. Had the second jab in June but not the same reaction. Now September i still have problems.Vertigo and the sensation of the brain being slightly behind when moving my head. Like being drunk and moving your head and the brain can't keep up. Lost the energy that i once had too. Wish i hadn't had the vaccine as i was a healthy fit man before the jab.
1	"Sterilizing immunity means that the immune system is able to stop a pathogen, including viruses, from replicating within your body." That's what measles vaccine does, COVID vaccine not like that, nor are many others. COVID vaccine very effective at preventing severe disease and death.
0	I joined the military. Got COVID. Never got the shot. After the two weeks of intense sickness, nausea, sleeping, etc. I felt good about a week after. Lost all taste for a few weeks after got it back. Also, the worst of it was the cold heat flashes I got had to stick my head in a refrigerator. Also, soemthing mentally changed in me. I was doing good, and then boom. Depression and anxiety hit me like a brick. I had a ton of energy and I was doing good.
1	As a new teacher, this is a huge relief. Not only can I teach with a real smile again, but I can see my students faces.
1	so right voters triggered with the statement, but they said covid has 99.999999% survival rate.
1	Thankyou to you amazing scientists, forever grateful <3
0	Do you also have a video about all the people who's been harmed or died shortly after being vax'd? And the damage masking these children have done?
0	Glad I said no to the jab and stood my ground despite the challenges from friends and families. I don't trust the system period.
1	Vaccine day! Selfie with my band-aid. Feeling like a champ.
1	This is what vaccination does. Currently there are only 316,000 people aged over 18 who have not received a single COVID-19 vaccine. That is 1.5% of the population over 18. It would be nice to see more people who are able to be vaccinated protect themselves from dying from COVID-19.
1	Today, I’m planning to get my booster.
1	I'm just happy that I see so many people out taking their shots and thinking about other people. That's what it's all about.
1	Cant we just make it mandatory and have arm bands on us so we know who got it and didn't. And we can round up those who didn't and put them in work camps?
0	Pfizer Covid vaccine - it’s a killer or torture device for too many.
1	The moderna vaccine is going to work and they are going to start production during the trial so it’s gonna be lit.
1	The vaccination process was quick, easy, and safe.
1	Sure you do sure you do do you also believe the earth is flat and that global warming isn't real because if so we've hit the jackpot of stupidity.
1	i had the worst case of covid for almost three weeks and was in the hospital. Im still a bit run down and tired but I am looking into getting the vaccine when my symptoms go away.
1	Coronavirus: Exists Scientists: "I am 4 parallel universes ahead of you"
0	The vaccine is poison
1	Awesome. Let the joyous news be spread.
1	Got my vaccine today. No horrific side effects. Just felt a little strange. Get vaccinated!
0	What about the side effect of Death? If I get that side effect, should I be concerned?
1	Hope you are all healthy and safe with the vaccine.
1	Just had my second jab 💉💉feeling so grateful to all involved in the success of vaccine rollout 🙏🙏🙏 but as it is #VolunteersWeek a special shout out to all who give their time to help at #vaccinationcentres #vaccinated #Jabbed
0	I just donâ€™t understand why individuals who recovered from covid forced to take the vaccineâ€¦ whatâ€™s the science behind that? They literally had the actual virus recovered from it and not treated as such. They are also talking about mandatory booster shots and vaccine dependencyâ€¦ none of those things sound right to me.
0	Proud of this young lady for saying NO. I know so many people who had injections and are ill now. I have a 23 year old female friend who had to go on BLOOD THINNERS just days after her first AZ shot (she worked with the elderly at the time). She had to get a second to keep her job, despite her injuries. I thank GOD every single day that I donot watch TV, listen to propaganda or this utter nonsense.
1	Another #mRNA vaccine, #Moderna shows persistence of probable protection up to 6 months! 33 participants who received both doses of the Moderna mRNA-1273 vaccine had blood drawn over 6 months after vaccination. #SARSCoV2 neutralizing activity was maintained in all the patients!
1	I got both dosages with no issues other than a sore arm
0	I never knew that not wanting to put unknown things in your body and being scared to get it cause you might get something, wasn't a good reason not to get it.
1	It’s cool because when I had my 2nd dose I didn’t feel anything it really helped my immune system good
1	FACTS we know if you get vaccinated: 1. much less likely to get the disease 2. rare that you would be hospitalized or die from Cov 3. Less likely to get symptoms like cough & shortness of breath so less likely to spread 4. less likely to infect others (not impossible, but much less likely) due to lower viral load, less penetration into deeper airways, less active, etc 5. will help to stop the pandemic-may not eliminate forever, but will stop the massive spread (could end up like the flu where many get it but boosters & vax slows) 6. Reduces & slow spread & therefore reduces viral opportunities to form new variants 7. Reduce spread to those who truly can’t be vaccinated like <12 years old 8. By reducing hospitalization and ER visits it reduces stress on the healthcare system and allows patients with other illnesses access to healthcare. 9. You are doing the right thing fir yourself, your family, your country, and the world. This vaccine is highly effect, very safe, and FDA approved. Please get vaccinated!! -a REAL physician
1	I am a Healthcare Employee and I am fully vaccinated and Booster. When I got sick my symptoms were not bad .
0	Yeah, do you actually know the chance of vaccine injury after a vaccination? Spoiler alert: It's less than 0.000002%. I've been saying this to every antivaxxer I see that claims that vaccine injuries are common. The last time I checked, 6/330,000,000 wasn't a lot.
1	As long as it’s free I’m planning on getting it
1	You don't have the freedom to infect other people's children.
0	Not one of us regrets for not taking vaccine
0	Too late the sheep have been brainwashed, let's all pray for them😢😢😢
1	If oxygen was healthy you could suck it into a syringe and inject it in between your toes. Try it, you’ll die.
1	I understand your concern, OP, since you had a bad experience. At the same time, I believe it's crucial for everyone who can to take the vaccine, not necessarily just for their own sake, but to collectively put an end to the pandemic.
0	We have been witnessing mass psychosis.. I can’t be shocked at the general public s lack of critical thinking.. But I am shocked at the lack of critical thinking and debate from our Drs , Scientists, Politicians, government  adversaries, nurses journalists ect ect.. It’s terrifying really.  To all who stood strong against a sea of propaganda, coercion, fear mongering, shaming , blaming and outright deception..Thankyou .. You give me hope
0	what are the long term effects? Do we know yet?
1	I am fully vaccinated. Can I get another vaccine with different brand
0	I'm a pure blood. We have our own dating app because we don't want our partner to be gullible and also likely to suffer from SADS
1	It's about collective responsibility and care for each other.
1	If you're not a scientist, maybe listen to the scientists? They kind of know what they're talking about.
1	Seeing the drop in COVID cases after the vaccine rollout was like watching a miracle. I'm so thankful for this scientific breakthrough.
0	Vaccines are witch brews boiled in a cauldron (vat). Literally. It's not even debatable there's any difference.
0	The fact that you choose not to get a specific vaccine for something doesn’t make you anti vaccine, is like saying that just because you dont drink beer you are anti alcohol
0	Anyone who has or will take this poison is part of this murderous campaign!
0	So glad I stood strong and never got one of those jabs.
1	I encourage antivaxxers.  It leaves more vaccine for the educated people.
1	It’s amazing, and should be something we are all excited about. A HUGE advancement in the medical field and will change the future of vaccines. It’s a shame partisanship and drama is putting a damper on that.
0	I was diagnosed with leukemia in 2022.  I was perfectly fine until I got the vaccine.
0	After the pain I've been through for the last 2.5 years after my covid shot, I'd rather have just gotten covid.
0	They should wander over to Tuskegee and ask them if they're taking it
1	I did my own research on vaccines, trawling though the Israeli raw data over the 1st year of vaccine. In short it showed chances of death from Covid reduced by about half if you take the vaccine. The protection window gets shorter with each subsequent jab, probably just 2 months.
1	Those who refused to be vaccinated were self-centred and noncompliant. They had a choice to be responsible or resign.
1	I will be in the front of the line. Don't care if I grow another arm out of my back as long as I can take my 3 arms and go out and have a normal life!
0	i don’t have the vax, never had covid, i also never get the flu shot and haven’t had the flu either.
1	What we need to do is send the vaccines that are being left out to countries in need.
0	Fuck every one of you antivaxer i try to make you relise how wrong you are about not vaxxing but Nooooo you have to kill kids so  Very good  At Controling  Countless virisis In and on earth Every Second
1	I typically never buy the first version of anything, but I’ll take the risk with this.
0	If God wanted us to avoid diseases, He wouldn't have created them in the first place!
0	I know one person who died of heart attack at 38, and another one who got a blood clot in brain, both were healthy prior to vaccine.
1	This is wonderful news … what will the per dose inoculation cost each patient, and who is paying for it ?
0	The Pfizer shots and booster all nearly killed me. I lose 2 days of my life per shot, laying in bed with 101 fever and rapid shallow breathing, chills and odd stabbing pains in my abdomen and thighs. I get the massive swollen glands in my armpit and can’t raise my arm for days.
0	Kudos to all the uninjected!
0	Please Mr President Trump & Mr President Putin arrest all those involved in the experimental mRNA covid vaccine & save humanity. God speed
0	My neighbour died after astra zeneca, the wife is suing them. I take 36mg of ivermectin on any signs of a sore throat. It goes away immediately.
0	1. Don’t take it 2. Don’t take it 3. Don’t take it
0	By not taking the shots I am 100% safe from adverse reactions and 99.98% safe from Covid
1	These new vaccines are a testament to our ability to adapt and protect one another!!!
1	Vaccines are the way forward to stay healthy in a world that is becoming hostile due to overpopulation. Vaccines are the most safe and cost effective way to prevent infection. It simply prepares the immune system to fight an infection or invasion in a natural way without the help of medication.
0	Both my 70 year old parents have developed heart problems this year after receiving 1st & 2nd boosters. It’s really happening
0	I am unvaccinated and don't have any regrets.
0	Covid wasn’t the first time they tried to enslave humanity with a fake virus and forced vaccines
0	I've heard too many stories of adverse reactions. Not worth the gamble.
0	If vaccines are safe, why the “Zero Liability” contract????
0	I am unvaccinated and don't have any regrets.
0	Nope.  Won’t get it.  And I cannot be forced.
0	please sign petition to support truckers here in Canada finally standing together to fight for our freedoms. we all need to stand together at this moment in time , for ourselves but more for our children. it's not anti Vax..it's anti this Vax!
1	My mother did not vaccinate for religious reasons. I made sure my own child was protected in the ways that I was not. #vaccinessavelives
0	Smart girl for declining. The gaslighting around the C19 jabs is OFF THE CHARTS!!!
0	Not "tested on 8 people"... 8 mice! Zero people!'
0	"The media's fearmongering tactics won't convince me. I'll rely on my instincts and stay vaccine-free.
1	No, complete bullshit made up by antivaxxers.
0	In other words, the safety profile of these vaccines, medium and long term, is an unknown.
0	Amen! I will never get that vaccine. Everyone who i know of including my husband has never been the same afterwards. My doctor was against me getting the vaccine because i have lupus. Thank God!
0	This is what you need to know.    If you take it and become injured by the jab,  good luck going through the medical field to agree it was the jab. They will blame it on "stress" or "anxiety" .  Each to their own but, all i know is i only had one and it has done some good damage.  Never ever again for me, went from healthy no issues at all and working full time to not working anymore and dealing with health issues which seems like i have been a lab rat for the past couple of years..
1	After the second shot of Pfizer vaccine that I got yesterday, today I'm feeling a little bit sore(like when you get the flu),but no other symptoms.Does anyone know how much it's going to last this sensation?When I got the first shot, there were no side effects.
0	Completely unvaccinated here who got Covid and got over it in a day: feels great being unvaxed
1	just relax and keep getting your jabs
0	I didn't need the shot because my perfectly functional immune system sorted the issue out for me.
1	Covid vaccines are safe. Finally you admit the truth.
1	Sadly we threw away thousands of doses here in Canada because of the antivax movement. The short shelf life meant we didn't have time to ship them elsewhere. New batches are being donated so I hope they find their way over to populations that will actually appreciate the wonders of modern science and medicine.
0	I am SO glad I didn't blindly follow the propoganda and get vaccinated. No regrets whatsoever.
0	I'M NOT READY FOR THE NEW WIGS
0	This vaccine was all by design and perfectly orchestrated..I'm afraid we haven't seen nothing yet...
0	A friend stopped by the other day , he said soon after he had the jab he got a blood clot , he goes on to tell me that another friend of ours got a blood clot after he got the jab .
1	They have to speak in terms the idiots can understand.
1	if we don't take responsibility for our own actions and realizing that we are all a threat possibly to other and not not ourselves, we'll never see the other side of this! Let's put the politics and the ego aside and save ourselves and our loved ones... Together
1	And there are people that got it and are fine and still have their life....I've seen lots of those too.
1	Vaccines are a beacon of hope in the fight against this pandemic.
0	We know the safety of vaccination. Do we know how safe it is 5 years from now? No, but you could effectively deny all vaccines with that logic.   After billions of vaccinations, we have a very good idea how safe the vaccines are. The answer is very safe.
1	Anti-vaxx kid: turns 3 God: your free trial has expired.
0	I am fine with most vaccines but the covid vaccine is suspicious it is amazing that they made it this fast but there is hundreds if not thousands of other diseases that have been around for years they haven’t done anything about
1	Celebrating small victories – got my vaccine!
1	Received my shots with no issues. Let's all play our part – get vaccinated to safeguard our communities and loved ones.
1	it's not government it's basic science you can ask to any educated medical student they will always tell you that vaccines are safe
1	I believe in science. The vaccines were developed and researched and work. Your choice is to be part of the solution or part of the problem.
0	I would love to thank these people. Terrifying to think that I was about to get the MRNA, and was put off by all of the TV adverts et cetera.
0	Teens are having heart problems after taking them. I’d say that speaks for itself.
1	I got my vaccines as soon as they were available. I have had 3 and feel fine. I really hope others will protect themselves and their families and friends from this disease.
0	Another great piece exposing the filth of big pharma.
0	It’s not an approved drug. It’s a trial as there’s no data.
1	Yes don’t listen to the others, yesterday I got my 2nd dose and I am a spiritualist also ❤️
1	We have become far too complacent in the developed world. Our citizens have become too used to disease being a relatively minor thing because of the prevalence of vaccines that they underestimate their impact. A classic case of when something is too effective for its own good.
1	Vaccine myths are like viruses – let's debunk them and protect our communities with accurate information
1	I've had five shots total: two original, booster, omicron, winter shot. Haven't tested positive yet. My wife is on a similar schedule. She got it once but only tested as a precaution for an event, her symptoms were so minor.
0	COVID VACCINES ARE PURE POISON MORE PEOPLE WILL DIE FROM THOSE VACCINES THAN COVID!!!!
0	A vaccine for a virus that has a death rate of 1%? I’ll take my chances.
0	Dont trust something developed that quickly. Had covid and basically had a cold for a week. Not in a high risk group. More likely to get myocarditis from the vax than have serious covid
1	I feel so so lucky because I work frontline in the NHS in the UK so I will be among the first people in the world to get the vaccine.
1	Stayed COVID free until this month. Attended weddings in two cities overseas. Had gotten the most recent booster a month before. Didn't mask (no one did). Mistake. The JN1 variant is spreading fast where we were. Low grade fever for 2 days, cold symptoms, tired. Tested negative on 9th day. We are both very grateful for the vaccine which surely made this much lighter than it could have been.
0	If vaccines are safe, the manufacturers should not be shielded from lawsuits.
0	vaccine propaganda is brainwashing people into becoming walking experiments!!!
0	This shot has caused damage to people and other health related injuries.
1	That's too bad, I was really looking forward to when I'd get my Magneto powers
1	Got all my shots. Never got covid and feel great. I know i can still get it but my body will be able to fight it better. God is good.
0	we don't have evidence that these vaccines are "good", until phase III is complete.
0	Prove that it's safe!!!!
0	Matt Hirsch: Severe Neurological Damage From The Experimental Covid-19 Injection 💉(2021) Hoping he made a full recovery.
0	The only question I'd ask the reporter and anyone else: "How can you be suuuure, the vaccine is safe?"
1	“I’ll never get the jab. You have no idea what chemicals are in that.” They say as they pop a handful of pills into their mouths that they have no idea what the chemical compositions of are or even what the medications are for.
1	While wearing a mask and social distancing are important measures, they alone cannot eliminate the virus. Only widespread vaccination can achieve that goal.
0	When those  agree in unison, saying vaccines are healthy, this is  IMO in a fear based agreement as most of them are vaccinated.  It's similar to them admitting they are stupid.
0	All of the anti-vaxxers out there I've got one message for all of you I salute you keep up the good work
1	Please develop a vaccine soon.
0	Nope, but the time the shot was available for the public, I was not interested. Then they started pushing it for kids, and I said no way. We are working through our 3rd winter and doing just fine. Not one of us has ever even had covid.
1	The vaccine is the most effective way to end the pandemic. Let's embrace it
1	Whole family fully vaccinated/boosted, all of us have had COVID maybe 2-3 times since the first two doses. Each time I only realised I had it because I felt a bit run down so thought, better use some of those RATs before the expire. Oh shit, COVID! Oh well. Super mild symptoms.
0	The expert in the programme, Dr Adam Finn, who criticised Phizer and Moderna, actually works for Phizer. Who would've thought!
0	Wake up !!!!! Live your life ….. faaaak vacuumeds…. Mother Nature rules !!
1	"Thank you very much for your wishes! Yes, we need to have a lot of patience with anti-vaxxers!"
0	If you like being sick, and are tired of being alive, keep getting boosted.
1	You know what neglect is?  Neglect is blindly injecting toxins into your kids bloodstream and putting them at risk of vaccine injury and death.  Measles is not generally very deadly, it's about as deadly as a bad cough or mild flu.  Sometimes measles can be serious, but it's very rare.
0	First I wasn’t sure if I’ll get vaccinated. Now I know for sure I will not get vaccinated 😋
0	The amount of relief I feel that I didn't get vaccinated, even though I was pressured by almost every member of my family, is absolutely indescribable! I feel sorry for those who got it though. Best of luck, they're definitely gonna need it.
1	As a biologist, I understand some worry with the mRNA vaccine because this is a new technology, and a cool one at that, but when it comes to the Oxford vaccine (the one that can be stored at fridge temperatures) there shouldn't be as much scepticism as this is built on pre-existing technologies that has a plethora of data to back up its efficacy at providing an immune response to fight the virus. Have a good day everyone.
1	The chances of dying from covid are much higher than the chances of dying from any vaccination.
1	I've had ALL the vaccine shots. Just got over my second dose of Covid (first was exactly a year ago . Here's my symptoms: My nose ran. I'm in my late 60s and overweight. I did not have ANY of the common symptoms: no fever, no body aches, no tiredness. Just a runny nose. Now I did give it to my younger healthier wife who has more symptoms than I and didn't get the latest vaccine--but still not that bad. Don't tell me the vaccines don't work. They work like a charm.
0	Astra Zenka was my 1st . within 2 minutes after injection started feeling funny in my chest ,then my inside of my chest felt like it was burning on fire. I then started sweating and began to pass out. The nurses at to bring me to the 1st Aid in the back were I had to lay down . Thank God it even passed, but for days after my husband and I were very sick with bad headache flue like systems .
1	Yep. I’ve had my RSV and flu vaxes, and am scheduled for my Covid vax next month. Vaccines work, although they have proved to be completely ineffective at eradicating willful ignorance.
0	Is there seriously any evidence that actual fatality is less with for those taking the vaccine? Do not think so
1	You want a good pro-vaccine viewpoint? You drastically reduce the possibility to die from diseases.
0	Why vaccine?? 85% infected means inoculated! Vaccine would only be necessary for those few at risk of DYING from #Covid19. What we need is antibody testing, but Big Pharm sluts don't make money from that...USA big corporation world is greedy hungry nasty. You know right.
1	This chart needs to be shared everywhere. It shows how truly dangerous the COVID shots are. Drug Adverse Event Comparison (01/01/1996 - 12/29/23): Ivermectin - 4,297 HCQ - 29,415 Flu Vaccine - 223,663 Dexamethasone - 113,686 Tylenol - 139,025 Remdesivir - 9,478 COVID Vaccines - 1,621,120 Naysayers will say this number is so high because billions of COVID-19 shots were administered. However, Senator Ron Johnson ran a calculation, and he found that the COVID shots were 55 times more lethal (25.1 vs 0.46 deaths per million doses) than the flu vaccines. JOIN CHANNEL: DR.

0	Ever since getting the vaccine, my menstrual cycle has been completely out of sync, and I am concerned about other long-term effects on my body.
1	Vaccine injury is what I'm talking about. Not disease.  You vituperative simpleton.
1	Got my shots to help end this pandemic and return to normal life.
1	Excited for my big covidvaccine date tomorrow but my knee has been awful the last few days...worried about the walking, standing in line at the Village.
1	but still helps people and that's why people get the flu shot. I didn't say it stops the flu....it's not a cure but a vaccine.
1	Seeing the positive impact of vaccines in my community is heartwarming.
1	I just got my first Phizer vaccine shot today! YAY! I am encouraged by your encouragement to other people, Hank. I think we all are. Your arguments, especially your last one about yourself, were all very, very well-put
0	During the pandemic my wife and I were forced to go to a naturopath for our healthcare. All the Medical community was offering was the vaccine. Very troubling.
1	Vaccination is one of the best ways to protect yourself from the worst symptoms of flu, COVID-19 and RSV.
1	Where's all the anti-vaxxers in the comments at, go ahead say what you want to say now.
1	I will get the vaccine as soon as it is offered to me
1	Am I a bad person for giving zero fucks when an anti-vaxxer gets sick?
0	I'll never regret being unvaccinated.
0	Hmmm u guys are still advocating for the vaccines that do not work
0	I'm worried about the long-term effects of these vaccines; they were developed too quickly.
0	If I were vaccinated...I'd be very very concerned about my health immediately
0	I question the need for booster shots and the ongoing push for additional doses.
0	The Covid-19 response included several of the worst things that ever happened in the history of humanity: isolating children (causing learning disabilities), quarantining healthy people (for the first time in history), forcing people out of work anod not be able to earn a living, and mandating experimental medication are some examples - not to mention isolating family members and forcing the infected into facilities with the most vulnerable. That wasn’t merely wrong, it was evil.
0	Is it likely to contain Mercury and other heavy metals? What’s the risk as with other vaccines of other complications
1	Perhaps. I got my vaccine in late September and got Covid earlier this month. Symptoms were very mild (cold-like) so it may have helped.
1	It infuriates me to see such ignorance in our world, especially when that ignorance can pose a threat to other people.
0	Haven't had a vaccine in 6 years, I recommend we quit vaccines for less threatening diseases.
1	Completed my vacinnation. Thank you Lord
0	When I do my own research it means I’m reading. When these people do their own research they’re playing with their feces.
0	I regret getting the COVID vaccine.
1	I have been waiting for this moment for a long time. Finally being able to meet my grandparents in a long time!!!!
0	When it was known the vaccines didn’t prevent covid & didn’t stop transmission, all talks of forced vaccination, mandates for anyone, vaccine passports, vax to fly, needed to end. None of this can be justified! If you can’t see that, YOU have a problem, work on YOUR issue.
1	it's easily understandable even to a teen like me, so everyone needs to see this. hopefully people will choose to get vaccinated instead of refusing them.
1	On to actually getting Americans to take it   Spoiler: They won't in large enough numbers to be effective because our right wing populous is fucking stupid
1	The COVID vaccine represents the power of human innovation. In the face of adversity, we've come together to create a tool that brings us closer to overcoming this pandemic. Here's to science and progress!
0	I'm just not ready to trust these vaccines. It feels like we're part of a global experiment, and that scares me.
0	More vaccines, yay! We can totally believe the claims this time, totally.
1	The problem with covid vaccine is how its efficacy has been communicated. It think it over promises on what can do but I will still choose to get vaccinated just to get a better shot at surviving an extreme event
0	Pureblood for life yall
1	As someone who had covid last year and just got vaccinated, trust me, the vaccine side effects are WAY less painful than actually having it.
0	No vaccine for me. Don't know what's in that stuff. 🤷♂️
1	Welcome to the vaccinated side! I'm sad it took you this long, but I guess better late than never.
0	you're hilarious if you think I'm taking even 1 single vaccine
1	Why do pro-vaxxers make the assumption that we who have been labeled “anti-vaxxers” are against every single vaccine? The answer is because terms like “anti-vax” are designed to divide us. I’m not against polio or measles vaccines. I am however against vaccines for every little thing. Flu etc.   Pharmaceutical companies are now designing vaccines with hidden components. They add common neurotoxins to the vaccines which cause side effects that include Allergies, decreased brain and motor function, and impaired social skills.   These components include ingredients such as aluminum and mercury.  Aluminum is an experimentally demonstrated neurotoxin and the most commonly used vaccine adjuvant. Despite almost 90 years of widespread use of aluminum adjuvants, medical science's understanding about their mechanisms of action is still remarkably poor. There is also a concerning scarcity of data on toxicology and pharmacokinetics of these compounds. In spite of this, the notion that aluminum in vaccines is safe appears to be widely accepted. Experimental research, however, clearly shows that aluminum adjuvants have a potential to induce serious immunological disorders in humans. In particular, aluminum in adjuvant form carries a risk for autoimmunity, long-term brain inflammation and associated neurological complications and may thus have profound and widespread adverse health consequences. In our opinion, the possibility that vaccine benefits may have been overrated and the risk of potential adverse effects underestimated, has not been rigorously evaluated in the medical and scientific community.  SOURCE:: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/21568886/  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2819810/  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/22235057/  https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0162013417304749  This is just one aspect of how they are harmful. There are a plethora of other ways. For example It’s common knowledge that vaccines create/cause prolonged systemic inflammation which is the cause of most diseases.  There are literally thousands of studies and articles out there so look for yourself instead of relying on other people to spoon feed it to you.
0	your blood is super tainted now lol go do a blood analysis ya fool. Bet you it’ll be alarming
1	So well deserved. A fantastic breakthrough and the technology may be able to be used for many many other things. Proper scientists doing proper science which benefits humanity - perfect Nobel material.
0	Which ingredient causes blood clots and neurological damage? Just asking for a friend
0	I am choosing not to because there is not much known about long term effects of the vaccine at this time. I am absolutely pro vax that’s on the schedule, just not comfortable with the covid vax.
1	I usually have weird reactions to vaccines. As a kid my eyes would swell shut. I’m still glad my mom decided to vaccinate me and that I’m protected from a ton of disease, including COVID-19. 🤷🏻♀️
1	The idea that he’d prefer people to be walking disease spreaders vs vaccine in order to achieve comparable antibody responses is something a sociopath would say.
1	Both vaccine delivery & electoral college vote same day on Monday! What grateful 2 gifts! It must comes from Santa Claus!
1	Covid-19 boosters available for those who haven't died yet.
1	How are vaccinations ‘bad’ please explain
1	You don't get to "choose" to drive drunk, and if you do - you'll have to deal with the consequences. You don't get to "choose" not to vaccinate, and put people around you in danger. I find it extremely stupid that spread of disease (by not vaccinating, not wearing a mask, going out when sick, etc') isn't given a punishment, when it equates to, in a way and farther down the line, killing a person, or many. Freedom is relative.
0	Nope. Don't wanna die from complications to it.
1	You do realise that - on average - adults absorb around 5 - 7 milligrams (1 milligram = 1/1000th of a gram) of aluminium per day, while the vaccine with one of the highest aluminium concentrations - the diphtheria and tetanus vaccine - has 1.5 milligrams. My source: https://www.chop.edu/centers-programs/vaccine-education-center/vaccine-ingredients/aluminum
1	Just on the way to my second jab - hyped!
0	I know many people that after having covid vacines had heart attack, stroke, strong cough, covid, digestive problems and  strong pain on their bones, and varicose veins, headaches and tiredness. And for long time and also anxiety and anemie. That’s terrible.
1	I'd like to thank the US & Germany for making an effective and necessary vaccine with the speed of light. Just got my Pfizer shot today and I just keep hearing good news. Thanks so much, from Canada
0	I’ve never had heart problems, after my second shot I immediately started to have intense heart and neck and back pain. I don’t need a doctor to tell me it was the vaccine. It happened immediately after my second dose. I’m still having issues to this day.
0	Natural herd immunity is a more effective and less risky way to end the pandemic.
0	It's annoying that some things can't be properly investigated because so many people make false claims that real instances aren't taken seriously
1	I got vaccinated and it made me feel free. I could all of a sudden start to imagine that I was going to get to hug my grandkids, that I could travel again, that I could go visit with friends and do things I haven't done for a year and a half.
0	Had my vaccine a week ago.. Still feel rough... after they gave me the jab they gave me a document with precautions to contact my doctor if I had any of those... Bit late to contact my doctor after I've had my vaccine... won't be having the second..
1	The vaccine has provided me with a newfound confidence to navigate the ongoing challenges of the pandemic.
1	I am all for vaccines, however I got the vaccine, got both my shots and yes after 10 months later I got sick from covid 19. omi beats the vaccines. Different spike protien I think. Vaccine might work for the other variants .
1	(To be clear I’m definitely getting the vaccine as soon as humanly possible) I think honestly the biggest reason I, and others i know, aren’t MORE excited is because 2020 has made us so damn wary of good news that it’s like we’re waiting for the curtain to get drawn back on why we shouldn’t actually be excited. That being said, thank you for this video and reminding me that i should be REALLY ENCOURAGED BY THIS NEWS!
0	Are you pretending there isn’t research coming out that shows a massive number of deaths tied to the vaccine? Not even going to address it?
1	1st vaccine done..😘😘 #supportvaccine
0	I am 76 yo and refuse to be vaccinated. It's been 3 yrs and I am well.
0	If your neighbor died two days after taking the COVID jab, and local news refused to report it, you can smell something was wrong.
0	If a person or government is forcing you to do or take something, you don't have to do any research or prove anything, just refuse it by default, because they want to hurt you.
1	99,7 % WHO HAD COVID GOT BETTER AFTER FEW WEEK THEN WERE ARE YOU PROOF THAT ALL SHOULD HAVE DIE ? POPLES WHO GOT 2 O3 VACCIN KEEPT HAVING COVID HOW MANY WILL IT TAKLE KILLING HUMAN NATURAL IMMUNITY ? MIGHT BE WHY SO MANY PEOPLESDIEED AFTERGETTING SHOOT ?
1	You'll have plenty of evidence in your thread but you'll ignore it. As an example, not only am I not giving my kids the covid vaccine, I've also stopped given them the flu vaccine. Prior to covid we all got our vaccines like clockwork.
1	We all must be forever thankful to science for successfully producing vaccine for COVID19 within 9 months of the pandemic
1	If your company hasn’t already required vaccines or frequent testing you probably work for a really shit organization and should consider leaving.
1	Research and data tell us the most effective and safe way to protect against COVID-19 is for anyone over 5 to be vaccinated and, if eligible, get their booster shot. Do it today!
1	Just vaccinate you kids. Don’t be irresponsible
1	Benefit your chances of survival go up.
1	A brave heart needs to act courageous. When once in a century pandemic is ready to wipe out the planet this is excellent. Thank you, to the Prime Minister and to the people of Norway for this initiative. I hope #COVID19 vaccines will soon help the suffering world.
0	I'm concerned about the long-term side effects of vaccines that haven't been fully studied.
0	The scariest thing about the jab is that it stays in your body for as long as your alive, triggering all types of things that would have stayed dormant, neatly packaged away - protected by our natural immunity. Scariest part is that the person will never know for sure when it will trigger
0	THANK GOD I DID NOT GET THE VACCINE
1	This is like click bait because I knew Dr. Seheult would be turning this around to show that the vaccine is glorious.
0	The 'effectiveness' hasn't really 'changed'. We WERE the test subjects.
1	The shot was quick, and the peace of mind is instant. Here's to a healthier world!
0	Wouldn’t put that thing in my kid
1	Vaccines! Do they work? So far the answer is yes. Are they effective? It appears they are for vulnerable age groups. The question is will this last with the new Omicron variant?  I use data from The Center for Disease Control and Prevention to create this chart. I used Javascript and Adobe After Effects, which was linked to an underlying json file.
1	Vaccination is a responsible choice that aligns with the principles of social responsibility.
1	I hate getting shots, I hate going to the doctors but I’m happy to get this one and I can’t wait
0	One way to look at this, the "Covid virus, and the Covid vaccine" scandal was basically an attack on America but China had to make it look like every country was suffering from covid all at once.
0	Does the shot destroy the immune system??? That’s what it starting to look like...
1	Had first shot of AZ here in Australia no side effects still waiting for 2nd shot.
1	Remember it's not just the deaths, it's the potentially worse outcomes of the disease. It's the permanent damage that covid could cause to bodies which is also significantly lowered by the vaccine.
1	We don’t need those people. Let them kill themselves, we are better off without them
1	The article didn't mention the misinformation out there that the vaccine actually causes Covid. My brother had a doctor tell him his Covid was caused because he got the boosters.
0	Imagine being such an NPC you take two vaccines because pixel simulator box told you too for no reason lmao
1	There's no covid19 vaccine, so what relevance has flu vaccine to this? Keep mentioning flu, people think "sure tis only the flu, be grand". People do get flu vaccine but could die from covid19 precisely as there is no vaccine. Have you mentioned flu every evening this week? 🙄
0	This is the first time in history where people are more scared of the vaccine than the actual virus...
1	People around here are proud to have "pure blood" because they haven't gotten the vaccine.
1	the vaccine is meant to lessen symptoms not stop illness “The people who got the vaccine are gEttiNg siCK” *clapping*
1	I have had both vaccines thank you to the scientists
1	m a child and im vaccinated.Dont put others in danger, get the vaccine, stay safe.
0	By not taking the jab, I'm 100% safe from side effects and 99% safe from covid.
1	get vaccinated not only helps you. it protects every life.
0	I'd rather be vaccinated by something that prepares the body for when a pathogen enters it, rather than being vaccinated naturally by the pathogen itself.
0	Don't give these people warnings. Start giving them 10 year prison sentences. That will put a stop to their lies and hoaxes real quick. " You get 10 years, and you get 10 years, and you....yes you get 10 years. YOU'RE ALL GETTING 10 YEARS!!!!"
0	The covid mRNA vaccine is top of the list in the hierarchy of causes of excess cardiovascular deaths until proven otherwise. Those that ignore these cold hard facts are either unaware of the evidence, wilfully blind or lack a conscience.
0	Two years later and they’re still pushing it. Two years later and I still haven’t taken it.
1	Let's normalize talking about vaccines as a positive step towards protecting public health
0	I don't want. If you have guts, put it inside without my permission.
1	Because I care about my community, I got my COVID-19 vaccine and I feel excellent.
0	Thank you. It is astonishing to me how many physicians are drinking the COVID vaccine kool-aide, and spout its efficacy like it was gospel. We are only just discovering the health problems that will stem from that vaccine.
1	A vaccinated person wont typically have "transmissible" levels of virus in their system for nearly as long as an unvaccinated person would.
1	Got my first dose yesterday!  Why? Because i do actually want to travel again. Both in country and out.
1	I am from Bangladesh, which is a third world country. Before WHO and the government stepped in, hundreds of kids used to die from preventable diseases like measles,  small pox etc. My own cousin died from small pox  at age of 2 because she didn't receive
0	My mother in law has deteriorated so bad constant headaches, rashes, and can’t remember Anything after her shots. Very active and mentally smart prior. Doctors deny it was jabs some nurses say opposite but afraid to say otherwise. I have zero trust in most doctors today.
1	A lot of people have been expressing some concern over the safety of this vaccine because of the fast development. My point being this virus didn't materialise as fast as many is led to believe but rests on a decade of work. Also, the trial phases happened in parallel, not sequential with unlimited funding and govt support and no shortage of volunteers. If all other vaccines had this level of support, they wouldn't need 5-7 years before release. My hope is that we learn from this process.
1	I'm 27 and fully vaccinated since February because I work in a hospital. A huge benefit for me has been the freedom from the anxiety of getting myself or others sick. It's such a relief. DFTBA! - Don't Forget To Build Antibodies!
1	Americans are stubborn and Refuse to get Flu vaccines every year - the Flu is getting worse and worse . Covid 19 is just ring up what we always knew about the weakness of stubborn Americans !
1	The vaccine is incredibly safe. You are looking at the numbers decontextualized from total doses administered globally. Way way way safer than COVID
1	Yeah, I'm sure polio and smallpox just decided to go on holiday and the vaccine had nothing to do with it.
1	This is key as well - many people still disabled by long COVID effects..vaccine also protected/s against those.
0	Let's see in 5 years 10 years what the side effects are.  I had covid barely noticed. I've talked to 55 people that had it and most didn't notice some had mild symptoms and a couple people had cold/flu like symptoms....
0	I'm just over 50 unjabbed and no way on earth am I ever having this crap injected in me....
1	Thank you lord. .. For helping those people creating this medicine to stop this pandemic ...
1	Vaccines are a key part of our journey back to normalcy.
1	The mobile vaccination team vaccinated Tai Fati’s three daughters at her house in Bissau during the Meningitis A and #COVID19 vaccination campaign. Tai is grateful that her children are now protected against these diseases.
1	If your child has an autoimmune disorder you should be PRO vaccine, even if it means not vaccinating that child. You need the healthy children around your child to be vaccinated so they don't spread these preventable illnesses to yours
1	Got my pfizer vaccine today. Feeling good, just a little bit tired. Looking forward to putting COVID behind us.
1	Thank you so much for doing this video. I’m very compromised and will be high on the list for the vaccine in Canada.
0	A friend with diabetes, high blood pressure and depression in her 50's completely vaxed and boosted decided to quit her medications for the first two issues ( she refused to admit she was depressed). Christmas 2022 she had a massive stroke and was taken to the emergency room. The pain in her head was so severe she was pounding her head with her fists. The emergency room staff waited to treat her until after their shift change. She went into a coma with swelling on the brain. The hospital transfered her 3 times within two months saying they needed her bed. The family wanted to keep her on life saving procedures to give her a chance to recover. The hospital not so much. Her insurance coverage ran out and she was transferred to an independent care facility. She is now being transferred from facility to facility as her insurance benefits expire. She can now recognize her name and follow people in her room by moving her head. I have read that the Vax passing the blood brain barrier can also cause dementia. It's plausible that the vaxing and boosters caused her to become more mentally ill which could be why she thought it was okay to quit her life saving medications.  The medical system corruption is another story.
0	AZ I was in the hospital for 3 days could not stand or walk a straight line for 9 days. Off work for a month. Have not been the same since April 2020 ..3 years. And those buggers are still pushing it.
0	The COVID vaccine didn't prevent COVID or it's transmission. What is the prize for, harming people?
1	VACCINATED FOR THE LOVE OF LIVE MUSIC! 🎶 Let's get those concert vibes back, baby! Who's with me on the front row?
1	I booked as quick as my age group was open;got Astra,first knocked me down for 20 hrs[38.8C],second almost nothing.Get it people!!!Get any!!!
1	I am not anti-vaxx. I am entirely pro mainstream science-based medicine.
1	I got my first Covid-19 Vaccine Shot today. Feel hai! Thank you Government of India.
0	I feel sad for the little kids that had to get this shot.
0	"This is not the first time that Pfizer does something similar. Oh, but don't you dare doubt, you 'denier'!"
0	I did not get the clot shot. The surgeon general of my state came out saying the shot is linked to blood clots and heart failure. I’m so glad I listened to my instincts and not the doctors trying to force me to take it.
1	Getting vaccinated will help keep our loved ones healthy & our community thriving
1	Y'know I'm glad there are doctors taking the time to educate people about the vaccine
0	A sharp increase in heart attacks observed in people who were vaccinated with COVID-19
1	If you have to say everyone around you is "brainwashed" to justify your point you might want to reconsider your point
0	Tell that to the parents who lost their children when they **WEREN'T** vaccinated  &#x200B;  Tell that to then you total piece of garbage
1	So we’re going to just let immune compromised people die because some Americans are too dumb to understand that the vaccination schedule might vary between individuals based on risk factors
1	I'm also very happy I live in Ireland  where almost 90% of our population over 12yrs are fully vaccinated. We are still careful with mask wearing and hand washing etc but life is returning to normal.
0	Unbelievable everyone one involved in this lie should be in court
1	Got the COVID shot today. Quick and painless.
0	You just feel separate from others, just because you chose not to get the shot.
1	The misinformation out there is dangerous. Trust the doctors and scientists who've been working tirelessly
1	I had a crazy bad reaction to the MMR vaccine when I was a toddler. I still get all my vaccines. It's insane to me that people feel like it's some huge risk. It seems selfish to me
0	Those aren't side effects, they are the intended results. #TheyWantUsDead
0	Both my neighbors died, both women, both took the shot,  no one believes me, I'd rather be sick for a month than die in a year
1	I got my 5th booster last week. My father, who has been getting deeper and deeper into the conspiracies was concerned about the vaccine causing heart problems. I got Covid at the very end of 2020 and got afib for the very first time never having had any heart issues before (other than high blood pressure from being overweight). My vaccine and boosters never gave me any heart issues. I will continue to get vaccinated because having Covid and the residual issues afterwords sucked.  I am, however, magnetized now and it’s awesome! I’ve always wanted to wear magnets! /s
1	Covid vaccines are cardioprotective—they reduce the risk of major cardiovascular adverse events, and the mild and predictable side effects are far safer than the “heart issues” caused by Covid. Read the actual science.
1	Anti vax kid:When I grow up- Parent:I'm gonna stop you right there!
0	THANK GOD I DID NOT GET THE VACCINE
0	I don’t sleep with vaccinated women
1	Trust in science is key
1	Vaccine saved my life. In bed with Covid. What?!? If I wasn’t vaccinated, I’d be dead. I am severely Immuno compromised. Now, I have a mild fever.
0	Never again accept the poison
1	My Grandpa was 107 years old. He got the vaccine and died about 6 months later. Surely had to be the jab...
1	This video helps me to explain how important to take vaccines for everybody. Thank you.
0	one day you guys will realize you are on the wrong side of good and evil for pushing this poison
0	I live in Florida and if someone is walking up to my door and ready to stab me with a needle, this is a stand your ground state they better be wearing a bulletproof vest
1	I got mine today. So far so good. Glad you got yours!
1	this vaccine is NOT A VIRUS it is just an MRNA that tells our cells to make a harmless spike protein!
1	Furthermore, vaccinated people have a lower viral load, so even if they are infected, they are still less likely to spread it.
0	This isn't just about anti-vaxxers. It's about the fact that the COVID "vaccine," is being rushed and will almost certainly be dangerous.
1	I love that social media platforms are stepping up and not letting these antivaxxers spead misinformation.
0	Biggest mistake of my life was taking the shot to get my wife out of lockdown. 2 years later and I still have heart problems and thrombosis in my legs. F the entire medical mafia.
0	My mom had two brain aneurisms after her shots and died soon after !!!
0	I am unvaccinated and don't have any regrets.
1	Vaccination is the path to defeating COVID-19, and I'm proud to have taken that step.
0	I know someone who got paralyzed after a flu shot. Never again!
0	PEOPLE THAT KNOW BETTER REFUSE "THE CLOT SHOT"
1	Vaxxed squad, unite! It's not just a trend; it's a movement for health.
0	never been a fan of vaccines in general, so I'm not going to start now with the COVID vaccine.
0	Obviously they want to say that .. no one wants to pay compensation do they ...
1	its necessary that as many people as possible get the vaccine.
1	I trust the science behind the vaccines. Let's protect ourselves and others.
0	The Covid subjugation bioweapon vaccine. How the global elite perpetrated a plan to reduce the population through worldwide democide.
1	The most prominent argument you are making here is that the other side is biased, but the exact same could be said about you. I am yet to see medical sources that support anti-vaxxer theories that did not determine what their findings would be from the start.   When you say that pro-vaxxers are more biased than anti-vaxxers, I say “Damn right we are! The criteria of evidence that we use to develop opinions just so happens to be the criteria used by people who find evidence rejecting the anti-vaxxer theories!”   I do happen to know the facts, and I know what source material anti-vaxxers point to in their arguments, and I have come to the conclusion that anti-vaxxers are incorrect.   You also asked me “not to be on the wrong side of history.” Well, I would argue that the wrong side of history involves death from preventable diseases. I would also argue that the *right* side of history does not constitute a study in which the overwhelming majority of the scientists listed on the paper asked to be removed, citing scientific errors.   Finally, you keep talking about how evidence supports your theories. If what you’re telling me is true, then I would assume you have a myriad of evidence that you can show me. And I would absolutely love to see it! I am willing to compare evidence with you and we can absolutely find out what holds up under what circumstances. Feel free to even send me this paper you wrote.
0	I wanna stay healthy so i aint getting them either
0	Nuremberg 2.0
0	Well, there’s probably a lot that bothers me, but I think the thing that bothers me the most is how if we can’t as a society admit that we were wrong about something, or that the data changed and maybe some of our decisions should change, and so one side of the aisle or the other side had decided on something, they weren’t going to let up.
0	I won't take one without knowing the long term risks, and that takes at least 7 years to determine.
1	"When stupidity is considered patriotism, it is unsafe to be intelligent." Isaac Asimov
1	I'm glad you are happy. I don't care about the vaccine, but I do care about the happiness of others, so good for you.
0	I regret getting it. It makes you feel like crap and I still got covid.
0	I'm donating my vaccine to YOU
1	Thank fuck. Science fights back. The USA election is not so important globally. The vaccine is.
0	All of the anti-vaxxers out there I've got one message for all of you I salute you keep up the good work
0	Unfortunately, my family & I received the first 3 Pfizer vaccines. I’m an RN. You can call us stupid & naive. But, we did not have a reason, in the past, to not trust the CDC. They were always available and helpful, in the past. I will never ever again trust the CDC. And, I made sure that my children and my family will never trust them either. Now, I just sit around and worry that my adult children won’t end up getting something horrible. Stuff, I’m 55, if something happens, so be it. But not the kids.
1	I got my vaccines as soon as they were available. I have had 3 and feel fine. I really hope others will protect themselves and their families and friends from this disease.
1	You can't prove that any given individual would have died without the vaccine but you most certainly can calculate a good estimate of the number of people who would have died without the vaccine across the population!
1	In addition to long term side effects not really existing in any vaccine, and that the rapid breakdown of mRNA in the body is well understood, and the fact that mRNA technology is not new to human use, I'd like to add a specific date: mRNA technology has been tested in humans since at least 2011, and no long term term side effects have ever been found.
0	I'll never regret being unvaccinated.
0	People who vaccinate are just brainwashed to believe in vaccines.
0	i had one vaccine and then i came to my senses
0	Hmm another variant... Couldn't be all those boosters everyone keeps getting.
1	Immunizations protect individuals and communities from serious illnesses.
1	Get vaccinated! Enjoy the benefits :)
1	I do not understand how anti vaxx people aren't scared to death.
0	Thank god I didn't take i was ready to loose jt all especially my checks
1	I’m glad I got it, never understood the resistance. Data is solid on it, mRNA has been in develop for ages.
1	I love how they explain how people can come up with a conclusion rather than the actual science of vaccines itself..
0	Yeah… I had Covid once like 2 years ago. The only noticeable symptom I experienced was a sore throat and a slight cough. Lasted for about a week. Haven’t gotten it again since. Thought it was just a regular cold at the time.  I only found out it was Covid because I donated blood a few months later and they told me that I had the Covid antibodies in my blood.  I’m pretty sure I’m good.
1	COVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective and severe reactions after vaccination are rare.  mRNA vaccines are most recommneded (Pfizer-BionTech or Moderna)
1	I support vaccines, many Anti-vaxxers are conspiracy theorists
0	I am uncomfortable with how government mandates for vaccination impinge on personal freedoms. It feels like my right to choose what happens to my body is being overlooked.
1	So happy and lucky to get the vaccine!! Everyone should get it!  I received the 1st shot an hour ago and am feeling more and more dizzy for sure. Two years ago, I was diagnosed with Ocular Vestibular Dysfunction due to a complicated TBI that turned into Post-Concussion Syndrome. I moved to Phoenix shortly after the diagnosis because Dr. Javier Cardenas, founder of the Barrow Concussion and Brain Injury Center, accepted me as a patient. It is fascinating what they are doing down there! Holistic stuff. His guidance and the continual rehab helped me immensely and I am still working with Vision Therapy and the like. In any case, I am glad to have found this site and look forward to learning more about the community when I have some time. I am a former athlete and can no longer live at 8000 feet elevation. I will be posting a question soon that involves oxygen saturation and labile hypertension.
0	LONG COVID COMES FROM THE VACCINES AND BOOSTERS (which I don't understand why you are boosting a vaccine that doesn't work?!?!)   The vaccines deplete your OWN IMMUNE SYSTEM so you can not fight off things -- even simple things like a cold.
1	What are the vaccine deniers claiming now since we all haven't dropped dead from the vaccine?
1	The anti-vax movement is absolutely ridiculous. I am a support worker for adults with learning disabilities and severe autism, and I have never met such incredible people.
1	Another person's freedom is another person's death. Such a strong statement.
1	Furthermore, vaccinated people have a lower viral load, so even if they are infected, they are still less likely to spread it.
1	I got my second dose last week! So grateful to the folks in my community for volunteering their time to ensure anyone that wants a vaccine can get it. I hope others are utilizing the heck out of that link!
1	I had the two-shot Pfizer and I was fine. I moved my arm the entire 20 minutes after the second shot, and it never got too stiff and sore.
0	WE ALL KNOW THE TRUTH !! STAY AWAY FROM THE DRUG PUSHERS!!!!
0	Russian roulette committed suicide while big pharma makes money off the Dead... Go ahead stupid people take it
0	So much people got forced into taking the Covid shot. Many people I know have some medical issues they never had before.
1	I decided to get vaccinated to protect myself, my children, family, friends, co-workers and our community. I believe in science. I believe in the vast amount of research that has been done in order to make this vaccine safe.
0	This, some people just don't need it and it's a fact. Making everyone take it proves that this is about control and not healthcare.
1	Choosing a vaccine is never an option. Go and take whatever vaccine when you get a chance.
1	The anticipation before getting vaccinated was filled with a mix of nervousness and excitement for the potential return to normalcy.
0	I have taken every vaccines of various dieseases as prescribed age wise since childhood. But looking at numerous unreported side effects after vaccination in India, I am feeling tensed and skeptical about this one.
0	Vaccines can have serious side effects, and it's essential to consider the risks before deciding to vaccinate.
1	Listen if you want to get the vaccine great, that’s the smart choice. Props to you.
1	This is a fantastic critique of the case study. I'm a healthy young male who is now navigating the health system to seek answers to my cardiovascular symptoms post my 2nd dose. I'm not anti-vaccine and understand the efficacy for older populations, but feel I get labelled as such for asking questions about my own health... Nevertheless, thank you for the quality information.
1	Too bad governments haven’t tracked killer flu like we track this. How many lives could have been saved? Does it take covid19 to pay attention to worse public health issue? Especially when we DO have vaccine for flus and most choose not to get it? SAD!!!!
1	one thing is certain: vaccines save lives
0	Enter bill gates he is the one to watch not  the notice and she never refuted the claim of the government uses this nano tech look it up the government uses nono silver
0	I've never been vaccinated, and I've never gotten COVID. I have a Doctor who was vaccinated several times, and she got COVID twice... I also have a friend who never had a health problem in his life, and less than 2 weeks after getting the vaccine he was hospitalized with swollen lymph nodes around his heart (which constricted his breathing). He now has Hypoglycemia, Graves Disease, and anemia. I'm not sure if it was the vaccine, but it all happened immediately after.
1	I STILL get fevers. Every single time. But I don’t have measles. Or rabies from that dog bite in china. Soooooooooo yeah, I’ll take it.
1	This vaccination goes beyond health. Be the champions you deserve.
0	Sore throat is one of the side effects after got the vaccine
0	The way this whole thing was handled has turned me complete anti vaxx. I hope everyone effected gets justice
1	Everyone who had access to the vaccine and refused to get it, should be turned away at the door.
0	Anthony Fauci = Josef Mengele... mass murderers whose weapons were government sanctioned medical experiments on their victims
0	What about natural immunity? I already had covid back in April. No need for any doze.
1	I am REALLY enjoying the peace of mind and Freedom after getting my Pfizer shots! Thank you President Biden for ACTUALLY helping the American people
0	Getting vaccinated is just a ploy by Big Pharma to make more money.
1	Stop bullying antivaxxers! I'm tired of liking all of these comments.
0	I worry about the impact on those with autoimmune conditions. Is there enough data to ensure their safety with the vaccine?
1	My sister had a reaction to a vaccine and can't get certain ones. She's still pro-vaccine.
1	Where do I sign up. I want to be first in line
1	How long do you have to wait if you have Covid until you can get your booster?
1	I think a huge swath of the medical industry, from the hard-core scientific to front line workers, should get an extra years’ pay for the amount of effort put into COVID response.
0	I’ve been letting my immune system do the job. Glad I never got vaccinated
1	I think I put anti-vaccers somewhere below flat earthers. At least the flat earthers aren't likely to harm someone.
1	Love how 95% of these comments have entirely missed the point of this data. FREEDOM!!! Them: Give me freedom or give me death! COVID: Okay.
0	yup... natural immunity going down with every shot..
0	I'm so glad I never got that poison ☠️
1	the vaccinated can still get infected *and still be safer.*
0	Hi Kris, I've had a similar reaction. Slightly sore arm after 1st Moderna vaccine so I thought if this is it I'm home free till the second when I was sick with a severe head and neck ache, 102 fever, body aches and chills. I was so miserable I couldn't even sleep it off. Ok I thought, I can gut through 2 days of anything just wish I had gotten the memo that probably should have taken PTO the day after the second vaccine. Then after day 3 until day 9 I felt like my body was supercharged, with tons of energy. I felt amazing. I joked with people that my body still thought the virus was present so my immune system was going crazy. The only side effect I had was a huge sore lump/lymph node, about the size of a large marble, in my arm pit of the same arm where I got the shot. Then day 10 came and it was one of the scariest experiences with my body I have ever had...it wasn't gradual, it was like this huge wave of dizziness came over me walking into work. I struggled to think or concentrate and I could barely walk straight. I was walking down the hall and my body literally veered into the wall. My blood pressure was elevated, and my doctor commented about my rapid heart rate, I'm guessing most likely because of the fight or flight mode I was in with the way I was feeling but who knows. After a few days I went on prednisone and things got a little better either because of or perhaps in spite of the steroid. I also developed tinnitus which is so annoying. For about two weeks it was pretty rough and my doctor didn't know what was causing it..talked about an MRI $$$$. Now two months later it's either a bit better or I have learned to adapt but I'm concerned it's permanent. It comes and goes in waves and visual stimuli like scrolling on my computer at work exacerbate it. I feel like I have become a Covid vaccine long-hauler. I know several other people, including my sister that this has happened to after the vaccine so I am wondering if this is a triggered response in susceptible people. I've heard talk of a Covid booster in our future and this terrifies me. Especially if the vaccine is mandated for work and travel.
1	Imagine the fury from all the scientists working on this with all their knowledge on how it works and all the effort they put into this when they get told by someone that they won't get it because of what someone said on facebook.
1	death is a side effect of no vaccination, genius. Your cult certainly winning there. Vaccine side effects? Extremely rare.
0	they try to scare the unvaccinated. Shame!
0	Since early 2021, excess deaths, cardiac events, strokes, and other SAEs have often been wrongly ascribed to COVID-19 rather than to the COVID-19 mRNA vaccinations.
0	a month and half out from last Novavax vaccine (the two injection regime)...I thought I was having side effects and learned that I have severe arthritis instead. But I feel great, and I feel confident that I will never be infected as I was always never infected being a local school janitor, never caught any flu or cold from the students...
1	Dude, no one is gonna cuss you out or literally anything for not wearing a mask. You are not persecuted. Stop.
0	Not an anti vaxxer just anti cov vax
1	It reduces the spread & your immune system may not recognise this novel virus, you could still get sick and die. Reduces the risk of spreading it and dying from it. Vaccinate, simple. Help others who can’t be vaccinated be less likely contracting the virus. It slows the spread,
0	Nah I'm good.
0	Vaccination is not prevention of risk of infection. If my thought is right, then why is it being hyped that "even vaccinated beings get covid-ified" ?
1	Get vaccinated, that's the problem with covid, you don't know how it will affect you!
0	Yeah the vaccine + Paxlovid day one of symptoms didn't stop Covid from fucking me up unfortunately 🫤
0	All of the anti-vaxxers out there I've got one message for all of you I salute you keep up the good work
0	My sister (a nurse) had 4 jabs now. She had blood clot in lung and pneumonia last year. She’s developed asthma too. She’s always having to take time off with sickness. Her health has steadily declined over past two years. Prior to that she had a healthy immune system and often said herself, just how robust she was. Sadly she thinks I’m a conspiracy theorist and won’t listen to anything I try and put in front of her. I’ve had to just step back and let her find out the hard way. The thing is, the hard way could very well cost her her life. She’s only 57

1	i had my first dose and i went to the gym the day after lol
0	Nobody wants bill Gates vaccine/microchip
0	Literally got a fever the same day as when I got my 1st round. I didn't know what to do, so I got it anyway and now I feel like shit.
0	Lies!
0	I’m not doing shit unless there’s decades of longitudinal data showing it’s safety and effectiveness. Like there is for all the vaccines children had to take prior to going to school. All those vaccines have decades of data showing it’s safety and effectiveness. How many decades of data do we have on the covid vaccines?
0	I personally have first hand knowledge of Covid vaccination related sudden heart attacks, strokes, newly diagnosed epilepsy, gangrene due to deep vein thrombosis, shingles, Bells Palsy, and severe menstruations, even loss of a pregnancy at 30 weeks. These cases are real. And people fouble vaccinated are repeatedly off sick, cannot fight infection.
0	I'm just over 50 unjabbed and no way on earth am I ever having this crap vaccines getting injected in me....
0	Haven't had a vaccine in 6 years, I recommend we quit vaccines for less threatening diseases.
1	cringed so hard from these tik tok doofuses that my bones shattered
1	I'm encouraged by the positive results of the vaccine trials
0	they forgot to mention faster vaccines and less time to test it . more side effects
1	Got Pfizer one here in the UK and was off work for two days after it wiped me out briefly. Mostly with the extended tiredness, fever and chills. I’ve always reacted this way to the flu jab ect so I wasn’t surprised by any means. But SO glad I’ve got the first dose already.
1	I had covid in the early days. Very mild. My husband had the worst case but recovered. We are both doubly vaccinated. Just do it.
0	I've had chest pains, palpitations, and arrhythmia since I took mine and have been dismissed multiple times by doctors. Good on the guy in your squadron for following his gut, I should've done the same. By the way, you're due for your bivalent booster if it's been two months since your last dose. Me, well I'm just not going to take it.
1	I trust in the science behind vaccines. It's incredible to see the progress we've made, and I'm confident that widespread vaccination is the key to a brighter, healthier future
1	My doctor is an Osteopath and she recommends the jab, as does her whole practice.
0	Keep it for those that want it, I do not want it.
1	Getting vaccinated allowed me to participate in activities that brought joy and a sense of normalcy back into my life.
0	"They were completed quickly without skipping any safety steps, and that's why all the manufacturing companies have 0 liability when something goes wrong" SO BELIEVABLE! I'm convinced.
0	If your neighbor died two days after taking the COVID jab, and local news refused to report it, you can smell something was wrong.
0	I don’t know how much a vaccine is going to help when the antibodies don’t mean anything.
1	Believe the Science
0	You left out the part where the VAXXINE gives you blood clots and injures your heart
1	Can we remind those militant republican antivaxers that the military supports vaccinations?
0	Gives you a permanent and irreversible heart condition like a boss
1	Got my first jab yesterday and joined the 12 million that have had theirs. Amazing organisation at local GP. #covid_19 #vaccine #vaccination #astrazeneca #oxfordastrazeneca
1	I just got my first Pfizer shot and as I'm sitting here with a slightly sore arm (utterly normal), I am enjoying understanding what is happening in my body as I type this comment.
1	All these people in the comments trying to get there head around the topic . It’s pretty simple to understand. I think if people listen to the vid they wouldn’t have to ask how a vaccine works inside the body and how in this case this vaccine does
1	By refusing the vaccines, you are demonstrably putting your coworkers and yourself at risk, so if you work for the government, or a contractor, it seems reasonable that they would not want that.
0	I've heard about cases of fully vaccinated people still getting sick. No thanks.
1	That “Pfizer Alumni” shirt cracks me up. Personally, I’m #TeamModerna
0	It is amazing how little faith they have in our intelligence.
0	Vaccines are just a conspiracy cooked up by Big Pharma to sell more pills and patches
0	Dang look at all these bots saying “vaccines” are good
0	As a Norwegian im gonna nominate you for a Nobel price. You made me not take the vaccine and it probably saved my life. High levels of vitamin D is the best defence.
1	Is this the BBC or a government public health broadcast? That said, I would rather have this vaccine than the mRNA ones
0	I had covid 19 with the symptoms,  Quarantine for 10 days, I took turpentine during quarantine which tins the blood and I have asthma,  it didn't affect my breathing at all, one year later I got again this time no symptoms,  I never went to the doctor, 2 officers from work took the Vaccine, 2 months later they got Covid 19 and died
0	Studying vaccine development prior to the COVID outbreak gave me all the information I needed to refuse the new vaccines. Best decision I ever made
0	Thank goodness, They finally banned that.
1	Lots of happy, smiling over 85 years olds delighted to get first dose of #PfizerBioNTech vaccine in @ChurchtownGP

0	Im a hospice nurse. Can we talk about what actually kills people? Heart disease, lung disease, cancer
1	Yes I will get any and all boosters as they become available.  The leading causes of death for PD people are falls and pneumonia.
0	I have friends who are nurses and have mothers who are nurses and they all say ALOT of people come back worse after the shot or die from blood clots. SO DONT SAY THEYRE LYING. THEY ALL WORK AT DIFFERENT HOSPITALS AND SAY THE SAME THING
1	By getting vaccinated, you're being part of history. Let's end this pandemic
1	Covid taught us that there is a large group of people who are more scared of science than death… and that’s not just sad, that’s patheti
0	I got an amulet from a Gypsy lady to protect me from COVID. It’s works about as well as the shot.
1	People before the new vaccine: ugh wish companies would develop a vaccine faster Companies: develop a vaccine faster People: now I don’t want it
0	Doesn't matter I'm not getting any of them, haven't gotten any of them still alive
0	Feels like Big Pharma's playing us. I won't be a part of it.
1	Covid vaccines are not great at preventing infection, but they are great at keeping you from being severely ill, being hospitalized, getting secondary pneumonia, and greatly reduce the chances of getting ‘Long Covid’.
1	For reference, the flu vaccine's effectiveness ranges from 70-90%   https://www.healthworks.com.au/flu-shots-faqs/   The current effectiveness of the pfizer vaccine is likely to vary when the vaccine will be distributed to use on common people.  Anyway, this is great news !
0	Those without the vaccine are healthy and none have any regrets. The vaxxed...? Some dead, some disabled for life.
1	I've had both doses, and it feels like a weight lifted off my shoulders. Get vaccinated!
1	Get the fucking vaccine.
0	Thank GOD I didn’t get jabbed. Feel terrible for all the trusting individuals who thought they were doing the responsible thing. So sad
1	One more to go #firstdosedone #Moderna thankful @SutterHealth @SCCgov
1	I feel this coronavirus is an invisible enemy. I feel happy and safe because life is beautiful for me and I feel alive after I got vaccinated
0	I believe the vaccine companies (and the Governmental agencies under their control) have blood on their hands
1	I trust in the doctors and medical experts who have recommended vaccines as a safe and effective way to improve our health.
1	We needed/need mandates & vaccine passports.
1	i trust the science not the journalist.
1	Vaccines that we have right now  very strong protection against dominat virus.
1	The science is clear – vaccines are safe, effective, and the best way to protect yourself and others from serious illness.
1	Notice how right wingers have made refusing vaccines and not wearing masks a litmus test for being a Republican? Even Trump is getting booed for talking about receiving the vaccine. It's morally and intellectually dishonest to complain that Covid is still spreading when you're actively undermining all efforts to keep it under control.
1	Got my pfizer vaccine today. Feeling good, just a little bit tired. Looking forward to putting COVID behind us.
1	As a 27-year-old musician, I got my appointment within an hour of them going up this week, because I. WANT. TO. PLAY. SHOWS. AGAIN!!!
1	This is why I believe in mandatory vaccinations and now I support censorship against all antivax propaganda. Because although everyone has the right to fee speech, no one has the right to spread lies.
0	I am SO glad I didn't blindly follow the propoganda and get vaccinated. No regrets whatsoever.
0	Send that funding to the people of Maui. I’m not taking that poisonous concoction.
1	I choose to trust data over fear, and the data shows that vaccines are safe and effective at preventing disease
0	My husband was forced to take the shots to keep his heart Dr. appt at VA Hospital. After his first shot, I came home to find him passed out on the floor. It took about 30 minutes to get him to come out of it. He has incessant headaches, and dizzy spells. 1 year later VA runs MRI and then MRE on his hear. VA says his brain vessels are full of small clots. And he is never feeling well anymore. VA has it on his record that it is a side effect from shots. My doctor told me what was in it and would not take it. I did not either. At least I am here to take care of my husband.
1	I do not treat people with Covid 19, but as a healthcare worker who spends my day treating elderly patients, I will most certainly take this vaccine.
0	So you want me to get a vaccine with worse protection odds than the odds of dying from the virus it's meant to protect me from. Err ok then.
1	No side effects other than the injection hurting like a mofo and my arm being sore
1	This will be a long Twitter thread, but important. First, let me be ABSOLUTELY clear: 1. Correalation does NOT equal causation. 2. I am PRO-covid19 vaccine 3. I have a history of blood clots (10+ yrs ago). On 6 May, I got my 2nd #Moderna covid shot. (1/16)
0	I did not want the shots but was forced as a nurse. Got the first two Pfizer and got horribly ill. Refused the boosters and have been harassed over it. It’s been two years and I’m living with side effects from it. Extreme fatigue, vision issues, and heart palpitations. I applaud this girl standing up for what is right. The way people are treated who said no to the vaccines is disgusting, their concerns are real and should be listened to.
1	I'm getting my first jab today and second one in 3 weeks congrats.
1	I think discontinuing the vaccine will cost more lives than it saves.
1	Vaccination is an important step in reducing the overall economic burden caused by the pandemic.
0	That is so f....bad. Money are much more then children’s  life. F...bankers, f.....government go to hell
1	The mRNA vaccines have been given something like 15 billion doses. If there was an issue, everyone would clearly know it.
1	Anyone talking about covid-19 is a liar by definition and anyone injured by the virus or the vaccine is the fraud.
1	-decreased chance of contracting it -greatly decreased chance of hospitalisation -ability to protect those you care about and even those you don't
1	Funny thing is that if there was an experimental vaccine that would make you lose fat without dieting and exercising, anti-vaxxers would line up to take it without hesitation.
1	Listen!!! Everyone should take it!! Listen to experts!!
0	My mom died the day after taking the Pfizer vaccine.
1	Pfizer also going to Canada
1	Anti-vaxx Karens when they find this video: "This sign will not stop me because I can't read!"
1	My friend's sister died of Covid yesterday. Her funeral is today. This really brings it home to me. Whichever scientists can succeed in destroying Covid and giving us back human life - not the lives lost, but the lives still living - those scientists are indeed heroes.
0	No thanks, I don't want to die suddenly
0	Covid vaccines cannot survive any honest appraisal of the evidence. No vaccine on the CDC vaccine schedule can survive an honest appraisal of the evidence.
1	Just imagine being the pro-vaccine doctor who probably has 15+ years of studying, looking at countless studies, and practicing medicine only for a wine mom with zero understanding of medicine to tell you "you're wrong."
1	>everybody is at high risk to the disease if you are not vaccinated.  Most people are not at high risk of death or severe complications if they aren't vaccinated.  Most people are not at high risk of death or severe complications if they are vaccinated too.  Which one is more risky? That is the question.
1	Let's follow the guidance of health experts and get vaccinated to protect our communities.
1	550k dead. 150k on ventilators. So, people are worried about 24 hours of chills and headache? Good grief
1	Im vaccinated and have long covid :( i wonder if i hadn’t been would i be even worse
1	Jackpot baby, I'll take all the vaccine, mainline it into my body
0	I am so relieved I did not take it and neither did my husband or kids.
0	pharmaceutical career, and i definitely say no to covid vaccines... no efficacy and safety studies. No real long-term clinical studies and find it hard to believe that Pfizer and Moderna are getting away with pushing this poison!
0	Stop calling it a vaccine, it’s a population control mechanism check out the number of stillborn and miscarriages plus cancer
0	I don't put that poison garbage into my body and I surely don't participate in the corrupt and evil medical industrial complex.
0	Never regretted not getting that shot.
1	To all those who say 'my body, my choice,' remember that your choices affect others too. Get vaccinated to help stop the spread.
1	I am ready for the vaccine. The owner at my work just told us he will give us a paid week off once we all get vaccinated, I love that he is convincing people by way of incentive
0	"Side effects are a good thing"......I think so too. Your side effects tell me "don't do that." I won't.
1	Vaccination isn't just about personal protection; it's a compassionate act for society. #VaccineSolidarity
1	you need it , your antibodies are not going to be as effective as the vaccine.  Possibly about 3 months max , whereas the vaccine could be a year or maybe more
1	Hail Science!
0	Still don't want it could care less about the breakdown of the ingredients
0	One year later and it is a nightmare for the tens of thousands that have been maimed or died
1	Herd immunity is crucial, especially for those who can't get vaccinated due to medical reasons.
0	So what is your Gov hiding? I’ve been sick for 8 mths after just one AZ shot. I only had it to care for 2 dying family members & now I cant help myself properly. My life isn’t worth living as I am now. Zero Gov or medical assistance
1	65 here. Vaccinated and boosted and my immune system and cell recovery abilities is just fine
0	4 doses? Why not 5? 5 doses? Why not 6?..... on and on it goes and people are lapping it up!
1	I wish I took note of all the antivaxxers saying the covid vaccine will kill us so i could send them a pic of me living 2 years and 4 vaccines later
0	Don't fall for it! (COVID-19 Vaccine)
0	1- I don’t want it 2- It doesn’t prevent catching COVID 3- it doesn’t prevent spreading COVID 4- I already had COVID and I survived 5- the proof of concepts were created using aborted fetus cells, and I am a Christian who has a religious belief that abortion is wrong, and therefore the vaccine is unclean 6- my dad had a stroke at a young age, and the doctors told us that we have a rare blood disorder where it clots easily, so I am already at high risk for a stroke and the vaccine is known to cause blood clots “rarely” 7- i believe that people should be able to make their own decisions 8- I have constitutional rights
1	Still fine here after being double vaxxed with Pfizer and a survivor of covid in 2020
1	Thankfully (or not, depending on how you look at it) the vaccine probability and severity of complications are statistically much less common/severe than infection from the virus itself
1	The vaccine is a game-changer
0	Off course there were short cuts or it would have been put through the long established procedures. You admit, with no shame whatsoever,  that the pressures caused by the pandemic meant it had to be authorised for emergency use only. This is undeniable so please, please stop denying it. Or stop vaccination until it has achieved the usual tests.
0	I'd suffered with CFS for 15yrs at the time of the onset of the pandemic. My gut feeling told me not to get the vaccination, but I was given a really hard time about it. Thank goodness I listened to my gut!
1	Vaccine day felt like a sci-fi movie, but the happy ending kind, one small jab for man, one giant leap for mankind.
0	Laws put in place before distribution CANNOT LAW SUE FOR DEATH OR INJURY From vaccination!
0	No one is sticking that poison ️ in my arm
0	I swear the amount of evil that goes on is beyond fathomable
1	And.. if a kid is not likely to get damaged by vaccines it's also not likely to get damaged from the disease the vaccine is for.  Works both ways.
1	If numerous studies supporting the efficacy of the vaccine won't convince you than nothing will.
0	Remember this name Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove when she comes up on Nuremburg charges for world wide gynecide.
0	I'm glad I trust my gut feeling, the pharma industry is absolutely evil. I have companies still denying me just because I'm unvaccinated, its crazy
1	If you are going to blame the vaccine on every cardiac arrest that happens, you are going to be busy (it's always been a leading cause of death) .
0	Freaking disgusting that Moderna is allowed to get away with this shit.
0	Simply stated… If the vaccine doesn’t 100% stop you from getting Covid OR keep you from being able to spread it… How does you having it protect others? If “less Likely” is your fake valid start to your answer please, just don’t try.
1	Still unvaccinated, and couldn’t be happier.
1	100% vaccine work! Simply review the facts on TB, polio, measles etc.
0	Oh my gosh, I never got the jab and I’m perfectly fine!
0	I no longer have those episodes but completely regret the vaccine.
1	What vaccine contributed to an increase in deaths of that disease more so than the countries less vaccinated?
1	Dead people can’t vote. The more anti-vaxers, the less anti-vaxers…
0	What a bunch of BS. Please think twice before taking this toxic vaccine
1	Very cool
1	On the plus side, only those smart enough will vaccinate and therefore survive while the stupid will not.
1	Announcement: I  am relieved to announce that I just herd from my oldest daughter that my youngest grand daughter 5 years old, just got her #COVID19 vaccine 2nd shot.  One more to go, but he my adopted grandson is only 4 and has 8 more months to wait.
1	Just got my first Pfizer shot yesterday, nothing bad so far except for sore arm. I'll see in a few days how things are going. Ok so my arm was healed completely in 2-3 days, other than that I'm still feeling fine.
0	They can keep it for themselves. If you got a cold drink a lemsip
1	Living in a time of medical advancements. Thankful for readily available vaccines
0	I still regret ever taking it though because i work from home so i should've never been vaccinated in the first place but don't know why i let peer pressure get the best of me.
1	Don't be misled by misinformation. Vaccines are thoroughly tested and proven safe. #ScienceMatters
1	The vaccine is a bridge to normalcy. It's amazing how science has provided us a tool to combat this virus, and I feel fortunate to have access to it.
1	I got my vaccines as soon as they were available. I have had 3 and feel fine. I really hope others will protect themselves and their families and friends from this disease.
0	I was in a forced vaccine program in 1958 and the stuff they stuck in me was so powerful it literally melted a 5/8ths-inch circle of flesh at the incursion point. If it does that to the outside, imagine what it did to the inside. Apparently I was screaming while they forced it in
0	Stay away from the poison
1	We need all the vaccines produced we can get around the world.
1	Of course there’s a plethora of studies on how vaccines are amazing for you if they want you to take them.. and these people aren’t just “researchers”, they’re doctors, biologists, pediatricians, and many statements from leaders on vaccination actually allude to how their experiments were unethical or inaccurate. We’re giving Aluminium, formaldehyde, aborted fetal cells, thimerosal, msg and more to babies that don’t have anywhere near a developed immune system yet. To me that’s common sense.. you can say it’s trace amounts, but many studies show how it’s different when you inject something vs ingest something. And I mean just aluminum alone being injected has shown to increase Alzheimer’s, adhd, multiple-sclerosis, and I’m sure you’ll hate me and discredit me for this but yes autism as well. That’s just one ingredient man.. it’s mainly neurological diseases that occur from this. Not necessarily death like we joke about here although it does happen as well. That’s why there’s a separate court system for vaccines alone. People have bad reactions to this and it’s for a reason not just cause everyone’s different but because our body doesn’t need this stuff in our body. There’s better ways to prevent this and most of the time the diseases they’re protecting us from are not as deadly as they make it. Like polio was more deadly before but became eradicated thanks to vaccines. Except it wasn’t that. They actually diagnosed it differently which removed most of the polio cases now they say we don’t have it. I know there’s a lot of factors but I think the facts are there
1	I'm high risk due to a lung disease, so yes as soon as it's available I'll be signed up. It's the only way I can see me getting back to something resembling normal over the long term.
1	OMG! We have this mandate in Europe (when dining inside). Really not a big deal...have the vaccine or be tested (testing is free and all over available). Such a big deal over nothing.
1	Thanks to the fact that the medical sector is being vaccinated, there is less danger from being exposed to the virus, so that very soon we will all receive the vaccine and we will be able to return to a lifestyle before the virus.
0	Why do they call for extreme lockdowns over a few covid cases, but the neurological side effects which is affecting thousands upon thousands of people are called "rare" side effects?
0	My uncle who eats salad everyday and watches his health Got the covid vaccine and a booster now his heart is in large he's got some sack fluid on the side And he's got something wrong with his blood cells.
1	I want to thank those who martyred themselves by not taking the vaccine, for helping reduce the chance of a future Idiocracy.
0	Hesitant to get the vaccine because of my medical history
1	Had to do it* to em (Got my booster)
1	I got vaccinated and it made me feel free. I could all of a sudden start to imagine that I was going to get to hug my grandkids, that I could travel again, that I could go visit with friends and do things I haven't done for a year and a half. It made me feel free and I have the hope of freedom to come
0	My 74 year old UNVACCINATED mother caught Covid. She had very mild symptoms and did NOT require hospitalization. She also has a heart condition, by the way. She lives in my household, along with my husband and myself. Neither my husband nor I were vaccinated during the time she had it, and we were stuck in the house with her, under quarantine. Neither one of us caught it.
1	Whatever side effects you’ll get (unless you really have a bad allergy to the vaccine) is not even close to the benefits you and the people around you will get from you being vaccinated
1	I had the vaccine and all my t-shirts that had stains on them washed out clean. I also became very attractive and I’m no longer lactose intolerant.
0	true, and now we have vaccines to control the population count....and we can select the types of people it will phase out through DNA selection. why do you think the studies have been sealed for 75 years?( maybe so the likes of SOME ethnics groups won't see what's really happening.....)If Hitler had a vaccine that can "fix" DNA.....do you think he would have built such a war machine?
1	The development of COVID-19 vaccines in record time is a testament to human innovation and dedication to global well-being
0	i would love you not to vaccinate your kids if you do have one, so there would be less retards like you in this planet bcs they died at the young age
0	I don’t want to get the vaccine because it’s too new and idk any long term side effects. I don’t think there’s some conspiracy or a microchip or something dumb like that, it’s just too new for me to feel confident about getting it.
1	Que the angry crying antivaxxers that would rather snort eucalyptus oils than listen to scientists.
0	EVERYONE I know almost has been sick ever since being vaccinated.
1	Vaccines contain either killed or weakened viruses, making it impossible to get the dissease from the vaccine.
1	I would disagree, I am strongly against a vaccination mandate but I am not anti-vax. I have all my vaccinations up to date including covid.
0	I got Pfizer Vaccine but my body seems different, the only side effect I got was Nauseas.
0	"And nobody has asked for accountability or will condemn anyone; everything is a very serious mafia conspiracy."
0	The only question I'd ask the reporter and anyone else: "How can you be suuuure, the vaccine is safe?"
1	The success of vaccination programs has led to the near-elimination of certain diseases, showcasing their positive impact.
1	Vaccines are our strongest weapon against pandemics.
1	With a history of health issues, the vaccine was a necessary shield for me.
0	Oh.... You are speaking truths.... You know that's not allowed here. The vaxxed are gonna have a meltdown
1	Immunizations are a testament to human achievement in medical science and public health.
0	My friend, who is 39, fit and healthy, was hospitalized with stroke-like symptoms yesterday. He received his second vaccine dose 3-4 weeks ago, his wife said he woke up in the morning and complained of his heart racing and difficulty breathing. While they were waiting for the ambulance she checked his heart rate with their blood oxygen finger monitor, his heart rate was at 155BPM
1	Well I think the message is clear. 2 shots are better than 1, 3 shots are better than 2. If you’ve already had a Covid vaccine please, please have your next one, and if you’re yet to commit, now is your moment. They’re safe, they save lives, and there’s one with your name on it.
0	More lies
1	Ohh yay , new COVID vaccines!!!! I was wondering when we'd get our 4th one.
0	waking up and feeling great not being vaccinated!!!!!!!
1	Vaccination is our best shot at achieving herd immunity and finally putting an end to this pandemic.
1	There are no known long term side effects and the vast majority of vaccines are actually fda approved. Idk what misinformation you are reading but do some proper research and you will find answers to your questions.
0	While I agree that elderly deaths are more common, what we really need to know is of the younger sudden deaths, what percentage are vaccinated. I think that would be more important data.
0	Had all of them and my natural immunity helped heal me. No clot shot for me sorry!
0	It bothers me that people lie about vaccines. It makes the public uneasy for no reason. Took me a while to realise that
1	I’ve got CV right now. It’s not a walk in the park and I’m vaccinated. Good luck to everyone
0	Bill Gates vaccines kill so never ever think of putting them toxins into your kids and your self....
0	My dad got covid and in the hospital. He got on a ventilator. Day 2.  He got the j&j vaccine  in March
0	We have an immune system for a reason. If you are heathy and in good shape you don't need a covid vaccine.
1	I'm grateful for the scientific innovation that has led to the development of vaccine
0	I don't understand people. You all isolated yourselves and gave up your lives for almost two years so you could avoid catching something you know absolutely nothing about, all so you could run out and intentionally inject yourselves with something you equally know nothing about. And then you people continue to intentionally and consecutively inject yourselves with more foreign substances with an even worse track record than the virus you were hiding from? I have a hard time feeling sorry for anyone who took the first jab but now you people are onto round 5? What's next on the todo list, MAID?
1	don't feel great, but I know that  I would likely be worse if I wasn't vaccinated against covid. Please stay safe and get the vaccines. Anyone who says we are "post-pandemic" can go kick rocks.
1	Vaccination is an act of solidarity. I got my shots, and I urge everyone to join in for the well-being of our communities.
1	Bill Nye did an episode on vaccines on his new show. They had this really interesting bit about the polio vaccine in India. Basically, millions of people were rushing to get the vaccine and someone said because they can still see the effects of polio, they're actually scared enough of it to want the vaccine. I think this is somewhat true - anti-vaxxers have the luxury of claiming a disease isn't dangerous enough to warrant vaccination because none of them have experienced the consequences of these diseases first hand, they're not scared of it because to them it's just a myth or something. Super interesting way to look at it.
0	At the end of this video, she said that you can still get covid19 after the vaccination. It begs the question, if that's true, why get the vaccination in the first place?
0	i honestly don't understand why parents allow this for their kids, that's some next level brainwash and/or cowardice, these parents letting this happen to their kids are pathetic in any case, if i had kids and they came near them you are DONE, i'd go to jail for my kids, i'd die for my kids. it's crazy how people so quickly become sheep because a perceived authority says something
0	Didn’t take the first bio weapons and Not Taking these Either! Period!
1	Feeling thankful and protected after getting the vaccine
0	I am so glad I never got the vaccine. Almost lost my job because of it too. But I stood my ground and thank God it all worked out. Wish more people did the same
0	With the vaccine being developed so quickly, I'm concerned there hasn't been enough time to fully understand the long-term complications.
0	Does anyone have any links to infographics explaining why we shouldn’t get the vaccine? There is almost nothing online
0	My mum had the AZ here in Australia, 4 weeks after 2nd jab she had excruciating chest pain, thought it was a heart attack, took her to emergency where they did all tests possible....nothing...we were told they "thought" she had 'Costochondritis'...they had no idea and weren't interested in doing any further testing, 'go home and take panadol and nurofen' was the outcome. I asked the dr if it was related to the jab and I was ignored. This was at a northern NSW hospital, the nurse that I spoke to said they'd had lots of people coming in and presenting with the same thing! My mum refuses to have any further jabs
1	I don't feel sorry for anti vaxxers because they put every body else at risk. They selfish and stupid.
1	I feel confident after vaccination and it gives me strength to fight against it
1	Just got my 3rd booster! The vaccine has worked great. I've only gotten covid twice and I didn't have to go to hospital either time.
1	I have got my first dose of Covishield vaccine....Need to wait for 45 days for second dose and hoping to defeat this covid
1	We're still going to need a lock down to give it a chance to burn out, and mask mandates so the anti-science/anti-masker bozos don't keep it going/mutating. Those 70 million MAGAs could wreck it for us. We're really only going to have one shot at this and we need to make sure we do it right.
0	No jabs and guess what………no adverse reactions. Shock fucking horror.
0	I am glad I watched this because it helped me realise that the shots are certainly unsafe.
0	Sorry to inform  you , Those who  got covid  actually  have better immunity  than those who get the Jab
0	My uncle was one of the unfortunate ones who got the swine flu vaccine he spent almost 5 years in agonizing pain before he died. But I guess the positives outweigh the negative because vaccines have never killed or hurt anyone right?
1	These new vaccines offer hope and a way forward in our battle
0	I live in Florida and if someone is walking up to my door and ready to stab me with a needle, this is a stand your ground state they better be wearing bulletproof vest
0	Just a quick question. If the vaccine works, how could someone who refuses it affect someone who took it? Since it works
0	What makes me laugh is how the government was going on about how great the Oxford Astrazeneca jab was, even though all the other countries knew it was crap and a bit dangerous
1	I'm getting my vaccine next week i'm so grateful to be getting it!!
1	Imagine u spend 10 or 25 YEARS to make something that can save billions of people and everyone says it's toxic
1	before the vaccine covid deaths filled mortuaries and in some places refrigerated trucks.
1	Kudos to vaccines for being the guardians of our wellbeing. Keep the shield strong.
1	mhmmm, you've just killed someone else's grandma by being a plague rat, since you can't process the fact that you've been getting vaccinations since you were 3 and nothing bad ever happened to you because of them love that look for you bestie!
1	I too would take a covid vaccine. I also volunteered for the trials but unfortunately didn’t get picked
0	Getting the shot is a red flag for a lot of people
0	They aren't intended to work the way we think. There's a bigger more diabolical drive behind gene therapy shots.
1	I was hesitant at first, but after doing my research and talking to my doctor, I'm convinced the COVID-19 vaccine is SAFE and NECESSARY for all of us
0	Ever since my booster shot my right arm has about 20% strength and I get very unusual pains and have issues I never had before Like nerve pain
1	The only reason I haven't gotten it yet, is I was waiting for people with more risk factors to get it
1	Millions died before the vaccine. They are not dying anymore in the millions, explain that.!
0	NOT A CHANCE
0	I am shocked you didn't realize this was coming. The vaccine from hell Pfizer and Moderna put on the market during covid contained the medium for spread of cancer cells at an excelerated pace. Cancer on hyperdrive! The American pharmaceutical industry is grossly corrupt.
1	Guys just let the anti-vaccine campaign do what they want and let Darwinism do its thing
1	The COVID-19 vaccine is a symbol of unity, compassion, and a shared commitment to ending the pandemic. Let's continue to support and uplift one another as we navigate these challenging times.
0	personally know tons of people that got thyroid cancer after the jab! explain that
0	I'm good. I'll wait to see what happens over the next few years as far as long term side effects go.
0	I don’t trust on this vacines. It is not safe. Many people are sick on this days because the vacines and I am sure is the vacines.
1	one person's freedom can be another person death. this is not freedom this is being selfish
1	Anti-vax mom: We know our kids best Every teen ever: Loud typing of LMAO
1	I have nothing against people not having the vaccine, just don't turn up at Hospital wanting help.
1	They are happy to see you getting vaccinated like them
1	India is one of the most culturally and religiously diverse country in the world but we have mandatory vaccinations for very low costs because at our population density if we didn't vaccinate we were essentially digging a lot of graves. To hell with religious reasons to not vaccinate. The only way I'm ok with someone not vaccinating is if they are physically not able to.
0	I read about severe allergic reactions to the vaccine, and that scares me.
1	I have took covaxin its a made in india product fully developed for indian people I don't have any side effects the people are taking covishield
1	Covid vaccines saved millions of lives.   Science and common sense have proven this over and over.
1	The man at 2:00 is just a short amount of time away from a ventilator (and ultimately death) and the first thing he says about getting vaccinated is about personal liberties. Amazing.
1	Vaccinated and proud! It's the responsible thing to do for the community.
1	omg we’re pfizer sisters 💅🏼 LMAO
0	I am so glad I never got the vaccine. Almost lost my job because of it too. But I stood my ground and thank God it all worked out. Wish more people did the same
1	Vaccination is not just about me; it's about protecting those around me. #ProtectOthers #CommunityHealth
1	There’s countless medical studies that prove vaccine effectiveness.
0	More cons than pros with these vaccines
1	Yay! Congrats on getting the covid vaccine😊
1	That’s what I don’t understand about the anti-vaxxers. They’re hung up on the fact that you can still get Covid after getting the vaccine, clearly not understanding, probabilities, or the idea that you were less likely to get it, or that it will be less severe. It’s like a stereotype that they only think in binary, black and white, on off, good bad, etc. but here they not understanding something as simple as “the vaccine makes it less bad”
0	Repeating what big pharma tells you doesn't make you correct there Doc... try doing your own research
1	The vaccine has allowed me to envision a brighter, healthier future for myself and my community.
0	"Thanks to all the good professionals who warned us not to do it—doctors, scientists, researchers, journalists, and so on. We should always doubt what the system wants to impose as its only absolute truth!"
1	All we can say is that if not most people are vaccinated. You can see the IMAX version of the epidemic spreading and raging.
1	These anti-vaxxers need to be taught a lesson and well, there is a virus that will do just that!
1	How on earth is it possible that healthcare workers in the US, like nurses, doctors, PAs, and nursing home workers, NOT mandated by federal law to get their vaccines?
0	So what happens when the M spike goes through structural changes such as in the case of the new variants? I assume vaxxed and unvaxxed will be in the same position after a few months. Simply put we cannot keep chasing these variants by vaccinating every few months. It’s not practical or good for our overall health.
1	Got my first covid shot yesterday I didn’t feel anything in that day next morning felt like crap and my arm hurt I can’t lift it up past my head. Feel tired a lot and muscles feel achey. I herd this is all normal cause body fighting off the weak virus but I’ve just never had a shot before that made my arm hurt like this. I’ve gotten no headaches though nurse said that could be a thing.
0	Then you even go as far as to gaslight people publishing a “study” saying 2/3 adverse events are make believe. The damages are UNDENIABLE and you’re the lowest of the low.
0	I've had the virus. I did not like it. But I survived. And I dont see a reason to get a vaccine since I stay home all day and order door dash.
1	Not vaxxing is a great way to teach your children that you're just not that attached to them.
0	Don't fall for it!
0	DO NOT VACCINATE INFLUENZA OR COVID THEY ARE CONSTANTLY MUTATING VIRUSES WHICH CANNOT BE VACCINATED AGAINST IN ANY WAY SHAPE OR FORM. ABSOLUTELY INSANE. TELL THEM I SAID THAT
0	LINE UP TO GET YOUR JAB. YOU WILL BE ASSIMILATED. RESISTANCE IS FUTILE. Then ... Booster 1, Booster 2, Booster 3 ... become a human pin cushion. ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ What about people who canâ€™t follow simple rules, like isolate, wear mask, maintain distancing, and DONâ€™T TRAVEL??? If people did that in the FIRST PLACE, there would be NO NEED FOR VACCINES. Thereâ€™s some Darwin for you! Everybody wants a quick-fix-it.
1	I think the same as you, will get this Bivalent vaccine ASAP. Only a slight modification in the RNA coding, not suspected to go wrong on human at all.
0	I don’t understand the rationale behind vaccinating children against COVID-19 when they are among the least affected demographics
0	Thank you for continuing to report on these topics. This is why so many of us refused to be bullied into getting the vaccine. I was ready to lose my job over it. We were all called crazy and selfish.
1	The vaccine is safe, effective and proven to reduce deaths, hospitalisations and infections and, in fact, data shows that the overwhelming majority of people admitted to intensive care with Covid are not FULLY VACCINATED.
0	Im pretty sure that if we were in a “major wave” of a “deadly pandemic” we wouldn’t need a reminder.
0	Nanotech, why would they want to replace the natural human immunity with the synthetic one?..
1	Strange to hear an American say, they want to know, what they put into their bodies, as so much American food is actually banned in Europe and Australia... And who said the same when Viagra came on the market? Being sceptical and researching, is a normal human response, I think. But it should be applied to all decisions...
1	I enjoyed Pfizer vaccine
0	vaccines are evil!
1	baffling to oppose a vaccine that's a key tool in saving lives and ending the pandemic
1	Whenever a Facebook warrior brings up “facts”. Just say thanks, and that I’ll go talk to my doctor about the vaccine. The fact that people are listening to a conspiracy nut YouTuber over a doctor is just fucking crazy to me
0	The best decision I ever made in my life was to not get that jab. Healthy and happy 3 years later, while a number of family and friends were not so lucky after getting bullied into getting it. It's anything but rare.
0	Well the vaccine doesn't work. People keep getting breakthrough infections.
1	Are people really going to be skeptical over any new health tech advancement that comes our way? Like get with the times it's not 1960 anymore the world will advance whether you like it or not
0	Don't trust govt or pharma. Why would I trust their vaccine?
1	I had a similar reaction with my shots. But let me tell you, the disease is worse; I got unlucky and caught it the middle of this summer. Even with the immune response from the vaccine and baseline good health, it was ROUGH. Take the “hit by a truck” feeling like with the shots, turn it up, and add a scary sense of vertigo. Definitely getting this season’s booster when it comes out.
0	these vaccines are not free we are going to reach record inflation rates nothing is free you will pay
0	As of May 2021, all covid-vaccines are on EUA only, none is approved by FDA, they are ALL experimental.  The article << COVID-19 RNA Based Vaccines and the Risk of Prion Disease>> finds that the Vaccines can potentially induce autoimmune diseases, targeting organs, systems in human body (Classen, 2021).The long term impacts to recipients are no known, deaths cases in short term are way  higher than average.  Don't make the wrong decision.  Be safe than sorry...stop forced these experimental vacc, sign the petition https://stopmedicaldiscrimination.org/  There are effective medicines to protect from COVID-19 and also treat the early stage patients, pls check Americas Frontline Doctors website at https://www.americasfrontlinedoctorsDOTorg/ and check the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), ivermectin.   The effectiveness of  these medicines is supported by the real world evidence (Hirschhorn, 2021), research by Dr. McCulloug, et. al. (McCullough, et al., 2021), and the Front Line COVID-19 Critical Care Alliance (Kory, Dec. 8, 2020).  â€œNew Study Shows That Hydroxychloroquine Saves Lives, States AAPSâ€ (AAPS, 2020).  When there are effective medicines to prevent and treat the early-stay COVID patients, there should be no rush to the experimental Vaccines without FDA approval. STOP forced experimental COVID Vaccines by sign petition https://stopmedicaldiscrimination.org/ Due to the fact that there are effective medicines to prevent and treat early-stage covid patients, these experimental covid-vaccines mandate has NO ground to exist.
0	Studying vaccine development prior to the COVID outbreak gave me all the information I needed to refuse the new vaccines.
1	I got the booster yesterday and feel great! No side effects!
1	Just got my COVID vaccine shot!  #Vaccinated
0	As a nurse 10 years in the NHS,  I'm so glad I did my resurch and refused the vaccine!
1	I too regret taking the poison....I have not been the same since....High blood pressure....joint aches....extreme fatigue.....never again will I take this crap!
0	I know one person who died of heart attack at 38, and another one who got a blood clot in brain, both were healthy prior to vaccine.
0	It's about fucking time the media began addressing the side affects of these toxic jabs.
0	What a sick far left joke. The covid "vaccine" doesn't work. It has killed tens of thousands and harmed millions
1	I'm done with anti-vaxers who have prevented the ending of this pandemic so participated in the killing of hundreds of thousands of people, then get it themselves, they provide testimony that it's real. They need to do MORE than make a pitiful video that all their friends ignore, all the anti-vaxers don't believe. Do MORE if you really mean it.
1	mRNA? A "novel" technology, yeah, with 60 years of development.
0	What could be more evil than propaganda aimed at harming children? This is sickening.
0	I am an ex nurse of 36 years. I declined the vx. My gut told me to. I no longer trust the health system or political system
1	What’s the point of this? The people who already believe the vaccine is safe already know it. Those that don’t believe it’s safe aren’t gonna read this OR the report. They’ll claim it’s some sort of propaganda.
0	Vaccines contain mind-control substances. Don't fall for it!
1	I got vaccinated to set an example. We all play a part in getting our nation and congregation back to a place of fellowship. Even though the vaccine isn’t 100 percent effective, if you contract COVID after getting vaccinated, it won’t be as life threatening or severe. By getting vaccinated, we protect ourselves and those close to us.”
0	Glad I said no to the jab and stood my ground despite the challenges from friends and families. I don't trust the system, period.
0	I note you believe clairvoyance is one of your skillls as you think you know what I read. Flu has a vaccine today but prior to that in UK 3.13% died of flu. Currently in UK 0% have died from Covid-19. No need to cause panic but also no complacency. That is my point
1	Just like Election Day when your vote doesn't count until you post a pic of your sticker, it's vaccine day for me!
0	praise GOD finally someone with intelligence and not braindead or brainwashed or PAID by PHARMA
0	No thanks I’ll take my chances
0	I don't care if vaccines were 200% effective and safe. I'm using my own body and immune system
1	I got the vaccine and boosters. I did not get seriously sick when I was exposed to it. My elderly dad did not get seriously sick from covid. He had the vaccines and boosters. He had mild symptoms when he got covid.. The vaccines work
1	Vaccines have eradicated or nearly eradicated certain diseases, such as smallpox and polio.
1	I need Covaxin man. But it's out of stock within India and we are left with Covishield (whose original formula is banned in many countries). Damn
1	I will definitely take any booster available to me.  I have not had covid and surely don’t want it in the future .  I get a flu shot every year and if there is a booster for the variants i will be the first in line.
0	I feel bad for those who are getting the shot !!In a year or 2 won’t be good we will see all kinds of side effects maybe even cancer .
1	If you think #Covid is gone, you are literally out of your noggins. Get #vaccinated and #MaskUp  😷
0	Covid is so dangerous we have to be reminded we are in a "major wave" by this person who looks like they got kicked in the back of the head by a mule.
0	Please take time to Read the data from the companies who created the covid shots I promise you won’t be taking your kid for the shot !
1	I actually used this video to discuss to my family why they should not choose which vaccines they should get. Amazing discussion. It literally took away all my apprehensions.
0	The media need to be held legally and financially accountable for their role in this crime against humanity.
1	This is what you call proper explanation of the vaccine efficacy statistics.
0	No vaccine for me. I prefer living.
0	Coworkers keep telling me it will make me sterile.
1	we should listen to the scieince guys, they literally get paid to be smart
1	Google the new technology emerging in mRNA and catalyst DNA vaccines and you’ll see this was new biotech designed for THIS EXACT REASON. Only western skepticism could look at scientific Revolution and whinge about miracles coming through from hard working researchers. The clinical trials and scientific researchers all agree about the motivation and the efficacy and logical immunology about these vaccines. If you’re a healthcare professional and you’re arrogantly throwing away all that consensus then you don’t really deserve your titles and you mock the role of scientists.
0	Still unvaccinated, and couldn’t be happier.
0	Im angry I couldn't convince my loved ones not to take the poison. I've been screaming about cognitive decline for months. My aunt has developed Parkinson's, it seems to be prevalent in my older relatives. Made whatever condition they had much worse. I notice my therapist is struggling as well. I don't even know what to say to her. This is hell on earth.
0	I am an athlete. I got my second dose of the covid vaccine 3 days ago. The next day after the vaccine, I couldn't sleep. I had the worst fever ever. Today is my 3rd day after the second shot, I feel normal but my stamina when I workout is not the same. I feel like I get fatigued much faster than before and I run out of breath much faster than I used to. I swear I am not lying.
0	I’ll never regret the decision my family and I made on Not getting these shots!!  Thank God I listened to my gut.  Praying for everyone who are having health issues because of this.  One day the people responsible will pay for this ❤❤
1	I got vaxxed in February of 2021 with Pfizer. Not going to lie, I was very nervous at first, and was for a while. I also have thyroid issues so whenever I’d have symptoms of that I’d think “oh god, what if it’s the vaccine”. Well, it’s not. It’s pretty clear that it’s in my head. I can assure anyone it is safe now. If you have a bad reaction, you’ll know within the first few days, and it’s also extremely unlikely. After a month, you’ll realize this stuff works and is harmless. Tons of conspiracy theorists out there that have always been there causing fear, but remember these people are not even educated medically, so disregard them. They read up on websites like godlikeproduction.com that fill their heads with fear and the “what if’s”. We’re good
0	Oh great another scam jab
1	It’s bullshit. Deaths from COVID outweigh deaths which may have been linked to the vaccine by three orders of magnitude at least.
1	I just got the moderna vaccine today and after the first 15 minutes I felt lightheaded and nauseous and got tunnel vision and felt like I was about to pass out, but it only lasted for 2 minutes. Now I’m feeling fine with only a bit of a sore arm
1	Vaccines: the bodyguards for your immune system.
0	Dear parents who lost their vaccinated kids -I am sorry for your loss but they did not die because they were vaccinated they died from a sickness that the vaccine was not able to help, there are also other ways They could have died, and like I said before I am sorry for your loss but not vaccinating your kids is so much worse for them and the people around them, people who don’t believe in vaccines are extremely stupid and neglectful to their children
0	The vaccines have killed about 23 million people according to some experts.
1	When unvaxxed people could then freely roam. The vaccinated community had reached a safe level of community protection. So, now the medical system could reasonably cope. Also, why the rates of infection didn’t skyrocket is due to the levels of vaccination. Limiting the time Covid was in the community.
0	So relieved that I didn’t crumble, I remained strong and do not have that poison in my body !!
1	i literally just got vaccinated today finally. Pfizer by the way as my doctor recommended i take.
1	Well, if you’re employed in a nursing environment you have to make sure you protect yourself and those you care for. It so happens that vaccination is an integral part of such caring.
1	FURST...like I will be in line when I can get the vaccine
0	Ivermectin is king.
0	I NEVER took the jab. I was pressured by my own family, criticized, and bullied but i stood my ground. MY BODY MY CHOICE RIGHT?
1	ngl seeing people suffer who are antivax does not bother me one bit and THAT kinda bothers me.
0	then explain the high numbers of vaccinated people in other countries being in the hospitalized? The majority of Israelis are vaccinated yet…
1	Acknowledging the role of vaccines in allowing for safer gatherings.
1	Getting vaccinated is a small inconvenience for the greater good. Let's think beyond ourselves
0	I NEVER took the jab. I was pressured by my own family, criticized, and bullied but i stood my ground. MY BODY MY CHOICE RIGHT?
1	Got my first vac today. I have to wait 3 wks for the second vac. Glad I'm getting it done. No more worries!
0	Experiment on human
0	I went through one bout of Covid, no vaxx no Ivermectin, AND NO HEART ATTACK!!! My trust is in God, NOT genetically modified toxins!!!
0	"And yet, people injected that poison into their blood!!!! What ignorance!!!!"
1	Vaccination lowers chance of long covid. Booster further reduces likelihood. Vaccination does not load the body with spike protein, nor is spike “disease-promoting”, nor is spike protein a confirmed cause of long covid.
1	96% of US doctors were covid vaccinated BEFORE mandates. They are a darned smart group.
1	As expected, tons of conservative anti vaxxers in the comments questioning whether the vaccine will have bad effects when it’s literally been tested on thousands. I really hope jobs start firing people who won’t get the vaccine when it’s available to everyone. The stupidity of you republicans is astounding.
0	you've seen the stats right? It's the heavily vaccinated that are getting covid. The unvaccinated make up a very small minority still getting serious covid. But why would you care if someone's unvaccinated they pose no threat to you.
0	The vaccinated keep getting Covid over and over it's crazy.
0	So growing up we got ONE vaccinated shot for measles chickenpox ect. So why multiple vaccines for this sickness ?
1	The vaccine is a turning point in the battle against COVID-19.
0	Biggest mistake of my life was taking the shot to get my wife out of lockdown. 2 years later and I still have heart problems and thrombosis in my legs. F the entire medical mafia.
0	I feel fortunate to have access to a vaccine when so many in the world are still waiting for their turn.
0	I don't trust the accuracy of the reported vaccine efficacy rates.
1	Let's all do our part and get vaccinated!
1	Vaccines drop your risk of getting ill and all of them are very good at preventing people from hospitalized and dying from covid 19.
1	Was at a party a couple of weeks ago with 4 of my friends. 2 of them unvaccinated, me and the other 2 were. Well the two that were unvaccinated ended up getting covid, and the 3 of us were completely fine. One of my friends that got covid ended up in the ICU and was in pretty bad shape.
0	No way I am gonna take the new shot. I am concerned about myocarditis
0	All of the anti-vaxxers out there I've got one message for all of you I salute you keep up the good work
0	Just heard the funniest thing. A worker at market basket was saying how she’ll never get the Covid-19 vaccine shot because she believes it’s fake. #Covid #vaccination
1	For me, getting vaccinated was a way to take back control during these uncertain times
0	How do you know it will be safe?
0	My uncle had a heart attack 1 week after getting the Pfizer vaccine, lucky he survived, but is in constant pain. My aunt also started having uncontrollable shaking and tremors.
1	I got vaccinated to do my part in stopping the spread of COVID-19 and to help us return to normalcy sooner.
0	I’ll pass on the covid vaccine
1	Timely vaccinations ensure that children are protected during vulnerable stages of development.
1	I don't care if this is considered extreme, if someone chooses have their child remain unvaccinated for NON-medical reasons and their child dies from a preventable illness, then that parent should be charged with negligent homicide. Fuck, I'd go so far as to say if anyone dies and can be traced back to you or your child being willingly unvaccinated. How quickly society forgets how horrible these diseases truly are.
0	NO! Vaccinating 6 month old and older children is ABUSE.
0	Covid testing centres are so full it's difficult to get tests, meanwhile vaccine centres are almost empty and hospitals are admitting unvaccinated people with life-threatening covid.
0	How many times are you going to tell yourself that vaccines kill people before you realize you’re delusional and seek mental help?
1	Seeing more folks getting vaccinated gives me hope. Maybe we can finally turn the corner on this pandemic.
0	I've never been vaccinated, and I've never gotten COVID.  I have a Doctor who was vaccinated several times, and she got COVID twice...  I also have a friend who never had a health problem in his life, and less than 2 weeks after getting the vaccine he was hospitalized with swollen lymph nodes around his heart (which constricted his breathing).  He now has Hypoglycemia, Graves Disease, and anemia.  I'm not sure if it was the vaccine, but it all happened immediately after.
0	"The virus has a high survival rate; I don't see the urgency in getting vaccinated."
1	Just got the vaccine! Only the first one. All I felt was tiredness and soreness! But I feel great!
1	The vaccines saved millions of lives, absolutely stellar work.
0	There is no question in my mind...... I have known personally five men in their 40s and 50s, who were vaccinated, die suddenly from "Heart attack" since 2020. There is definitely something going on. I'm glad I didn't take the jab.
0	Swelling of the face (for people who have had facial cosmetic injections, very rare)
0	And ALL OF THEM give heart issues.
1	The antivax movement was started by the Russians to weaken the American population to viral attacks.
0	I’m worried about allergic reactions from the vaccine.
1	greatful and thankful we live in a time where we can get these vaccines
1	It's been a while now. I stopped feeling sorry for the stupid some time ago. Darwin always wins the gamble.
1	5 shots and got it only once. Last holiday season was a breeze. Everyone was sick beside me. It could be luck or the shots working. Also I'm a frequent flyer, so better play safe.
0	So glad I didn’t take it. I suspected sth was sus.
1	Wow.. so, Americans are fucked either way, aren’t they? The vaccine only works if the majority takes it, and given the anti-vax attitudes there.. yikes. Good luck!
0	I never got Covid or the vaccine …
0	Read the intro “Updated” and “fresh evidence” isnt very convincing. Funny how a “large percentage” of people survived the “pandemic” and now we need the Fauci baton to continue, give me a break with this bullshit, big pharma continues to prove capitalism at any cost.
0	The vaccinated choose poorly
1	Yeah... Isn't that the whole theory behind vaccines? Vaccines just have the advantage that you don't have to get sick in the first place. And covid is nasty so i'd like to avoid it.
0	I love you Mr. Trump but you can’t vaccinate against a virus, doesn’t work. If it did the flu would be no more.
0	Don’t take the COVID vacine
1	Anti-Vaxxer is a simpleton term that is used to Lump a large group of people, with a wide range of Beliefs and concerns, into one category. Thereare very good reasons to be concerned with the efficacy and safety of some vaccinations. There are VERY good reasons to be concerned with any multi-billion dollar product, manufactured by Big Pharma.
1	Imagine a future where we can hug each other freely, attend crowded events, and travel without fear. That future starts with vaccines.
1	Anti-vax nutters are some of the stupidest people on the planet.
0	I personally know 11 people including family that died from COVID injections. No to vaccine.
1	these anti-vax people are getting out of hand there needs to be more school regulations against anti vax people
0	I hope they uncover how he made sure his rich donors were the first to get the vaccine, even before the most vulnerable.
0	I know so many people (all of whom are fully jabbed) who have got a constant cough or headaches or are feeling generally unwell.
0	I am choosing not to because there is not much known about long term effects of the vaccine at this time.
1	I got my second dose a few days ago. I ran a fever that just broke. Even though I felt terrible and thought I made a mistake, bottomline is that I don't regret it. I am one step closer to be able to do everything that makes me happy. A little bit of pain
0	By not taking the jab, I'm 100% safe from side effects and 99% safe from covid.
1	COVID vaccines are amazing scientific achievements. They are safe and effective.
1	i wanna get the vaccine so bad but my parents won't let me, but i turn 18 in a month and i am fully ready to get vaccinated then
1	Another day nearly over, still don't know anyone injured by the vaccine.
0	I remember when this was a conspiracy theory. Good times. Glad I never got one
0	I'm not comfortable with how quickly the vaccine was developed
1	I used to think people who were skeptical of global warming would at least listen to the expert when it came to their health, but no. They’d let a politician operate on them out of belief.
0	I turned down the vaccination offer last week and I believe I made the correct decision.
1	his makes me so nervous. If people have doubts they won’t take it. And we won’t get this whole pandemic under control.
1	I was hoping it had 5G but nope my bars are still dropping
0	I am unvaccinated and don't have any regrets.
0	My mother was healthy with mild arthritis before the "vaccine". After the vaccine and the subsequent booster shots she developed pneumonia Parkinson's severe rashes and full-blown arthritis!!! She was a strong healthy woman now 3 years later she is wheelchair-bound in a nursing home!!!
0	The vaccine probably contains mercury and other chemicals including raw eggs. A BIG NO!!!!!!
1	I tested positive for COVID 6 days after my vaccine, and I pretty much got it when first available at my pharmacy… luckily it’s been incredibly mild, almost no symptoms - so maybe the vaccine did help a bit.
0	These are NOT vaccines. All that anyone has to do is look at the documentation from Pfizer and look at the documentation from moderna and you will see immediately that there is no reference to these agents being a vaccine. To the contrary they are referred to as gene therapy drugs.. please do not believe me ..check for yourself
0	Trudeau just reminded all Canadians to get vaccinated because he got covid. Let that sink in. He is fully vaxxed and boosted yet got covid so you need this useless vaccine too
0	3 months from now he’ll have a 3rd arm growing on his back !
1	Father of 3 kids (5,5,7), the moment this is available they are all getting it. Then all the antivax chucklefucks can just fuck right out of my headspace forever.
1	Vaccinated people should get " first serve" medical care, as needed.
0	I've read studies suggesting natural immunity is stronger than vaccine-induced immunity.
0	I had my first pfizer shot a month ago. The few days after I had common side effects brain fog, lacking energy, very tired but after a few days these went away. What is worrying is the day after my shot my left leg went numb. I lost coordination in it and at first I joked and told people I now have a wooden leg, as that's how it felt and looked like when I walked and I assumed it would get better in a few days. This went on for 3 weeks and then on one day I started getting pins and needles in my left foot, the day after that my leg was better as the feeling and coordination returned, however it is still not 100%. The muscle around my knee, hamstring and calf all feel very tight like I have done a big work out or like I have a dead leg, it's strange. I haven't had my second shot yet and I doubt I will have it now, I am waiting to see a neurologist.
1	Not only vaccination drive launched but also exported 2 million vaccines to Brazil.. They were shipped yesterday. Brazilian air craft has been took off too her destination.
0	This is the movie we wish we didn’t have to make. But this is a movie everyone needs to see. For the first time ever, hear the stories of covid shot deaths as told by the parents who lost their children.
0	I regret VACCINATING my kids. Oldest has anaphylactic food allergies that I’m fairly certain are from his 15 mos shots. He also got shingles from the chicken pox vaccine. It’s all a scam imo
1	I was hesitant at first, but after doing my research, I'm glad I got vaccinated.
0	It’s a money maker and a life taker
0	i'll never forget how people treated me when i told them to avoid the vaccine.. i was already disollusioned with the world before 2020, and what followed just confirmed my disdain. glad theres still some people out there taking it seriously and talking about it
0	the Pfizer jab was and is far more probmatic and dangerous, it only got approved by EU president VDL taking millions in bribes allegedly, it's all public record, and the attempts to cover it up, but not the first time VDL has taken bribes allegedly, she did the same as German defence minister to allow not fit for purpose equipment in to the German military, they ended up training with broom handles such was the cost of her corruption
1	Welp. I was planning on waiting until after finals were over but it’s time to make an appointment.
1	Yay.. Which means those of us who care at all will take it, leaving the anti vaxers to pretend that they don't need any vaccinations because they never get sick, BECAUSE the rest of us take it, bracketing them in a false immunity bubble they're completely unaware of and unappreciative of.  You're welcome, you lovely, ill educated, ungrateful turd-jugglers. :)
1	Yup. Whenever I read someone writing about this all being some global population control scheme I can't help but respond to them about how much of a crappy plan that would be if it was real. Like, it's the worst kind of plan anybody can imagine coming from the worst James Bond fan-fiction villain anybody could think of, and if their plan was really to cull the population, they failed miserably.
1	They should make vaccination a law and if your child dies from some disease that could have been prevented by vaccination the parent should go to jail for man slaughter
1	I appreciate the tireless work of scientists and healthcare professionals who work towards creating safe and effective vaccines
0	The covid shot has killed more people than COVID actually did!
0	After 6 boosters you get a free toaster !!
1	Finally got the vaccine! Feeling hopeful for the future.
1	My dad sure regretted not getting it when he was dying on a ventilator. He survived and is no longer an antivaxer.
1	I have received the vaccine and got the second dose a month ago and am 100% fine.... I guess the microchips haven't kicked in yet
0	"I'm skeptical about the need for booster shots. It feels like an endless cycle of vaccinations."
1	My mom felt the same way until she was in a coma for two months fighting for her life. First thing she said we she came out of it was “I’m getting the shot”.
1	My husband and I have gotten all the vaccines available. Now I think we may consider a return to protocols - masks and avoiding closed spaces. We've always frequently washed our hands. We're older with pre-existing conditions and do not want Covid. Period.
1	Why get it if I’m young/ vax people are still getting sick etc. the simple answer is that the vaccine is a condom. It helps 97% from killing u /getting u sick. You still might get Covid but u prolly won’t know since the vaccine will make it its bitch.
1	God please give it for free your people deserve it esp those on low incomes .
1	Vaxxed life is the real flex . Protecting yourself and others in one shot.
1	what do you mean it has the virus in it? The current vaccines contain a single gene from the virus but no whole virus cells. How do you spread the virus with a single gene? Also, the vaccine is fully effective after 7 to 14 days, not before.
0	Unvaxxed and never masked. Still here beotches. Never complied and laughed at the sheep.
1	All of you complaining about these side effects are gonna be real shocked when you see how covid feels.
1	Got my first shot yesterday so far no feeling of side effect. Ty Pfrizer
0	I remember when the government taught us to say “ just say no to drugs” So I did.
1	Vaccines save lives, period. It's time to stop the spread of misinformation and focus on the science
0	I’ll wait till the animal trials are over.
0	That jab is literally poison!
1	Unbelievable comments..... vitamins and belief won’t stop you getting ill with the virus
0	Don't really care I'm surrounded by people at work who have already got the virus and are already back to work I have relatives who already got the virus and are doing fine. I think I'll take my chances with the disease
0	So glad I stood strong and never got one of those jabs.
1	First need to control the population of Antivaxers in US, then branch out.
1	I am vaccinated and I am not scared.
0	THANK GOD I DID NOT GET THE VACCINE
1	Got vaccinated as soon as possible. My son and his wife had COVID, but we kept our distance. Vaccination is the responsible choice for a healthier tomorrow.
1	I had vaccine fatigue and didn't get any further vaccines this year. I will because you asked me to.
1	Vaccines protects you and others form virus.
0	We all have an obligation to follow the true guidelines regarding COVID and the pandemic, as best as we can, so I do NOT dare, and will NOT, vaccinate myself.
0	NOOOO POISON ARN-M POISONNNN
0	I never got a covid vaccine and I feel fine. Tbf I got badly sick just before covid like many others but it sure seems to not be a big deal now. I wonder?
0	WHO can stick their poison vaccines up their arse1
1	I like the perspective on herd immunity in this video. I believe getting vaccinated is crucial to protect ourselves and others. As the video mentioned, vaccines aren't perfect; however, think of all of the people who have been vaccinated and have been completely fine. Herd immunity is about looking out for everyone, especially the vulnerable babies who are too young for vaccinations. We're doing ourselves and the community a favor by reducing the risk of having a serious outbreak.
0	When they’re offering a million dollar lottery, free rifles, stripper and bottle service for it, and it’s at the top of the CDC’s hurricane preparedness list (get the vaccine before gather supplies) something doesn’t seem right about that to me. Sorry not sorry. No other vaccine in history has been pushed this heavily. I’ll pass.
0	Why should someone be vaccinated if they have had covid-19 before?
0	Big Pharma is just manipulating us into believing vaccines are necessary.
1	I got vaccinated because I want to protect myself and my loved ones from COVID-19. It's a small step I can take to contribute to ending the pandemic.
0	Thankfully I stopped with experimental drugs in the 70's. What a relief I'm not burdened with the fear of a "vaccine" messing with my DNA. Also, my vaccinated friends keep getting COVID with serious problems. I've had it twice (2021 & last week) Each time had 1 bad day
1	Just THE most amazing news isn't it. Can't wait to rush to the front of the queue and roll up my sleeve!
0	I got my second dose here in Bay Area 10 days ago and since 9 days I’m experiencing chest heaviness and pain. Been on Tylenol per the doctor but it hasn’t helped. Went to ER and vitals seems fine. That was yesterday. I still have chest pains. No one is taking about these effects. I wish I hadn’t gone for vaccination. I feel worse.
0	Vaccines didn't save lives. Omicron did.
1	Today at noon, I received my first dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine! Super exciting!
0	I am not taking that vaccine until at least a year after it comes out
0	I got really sick after my second injection and got a really bad ear infection. I have never had an ear infection before until now. It was awful, it got to the point I couldn’t breathe my nose was running snot constantly, no taste, and my ears hurt so bad
1	Wonderful. So 200M of Pfizer and 200M of Moderna, 2 shots each will cover 200M people. If J&J's one shot pans out, that's another 100M and would be enough for the whole population. If Oxford/AZ makes it through, I'd expect anybody to be able to get vaccinated by late Spring. I wish Novavax's would pan out. Its data seemed really good
0	FACT: COVID shots were not vaccines and did more harm than good
0	Biden's anger at the unvaccinated made me decide not to get the Jab.
0	the vaccine industry profits off the suffering of those they claim to protect?
1	The vaccine brought peace of mind and protection from severe illness.
1	Why wouldn't you have it. If it stops you getting the virus and by doing that it stops you passing it on to elderly vulnerable relatives, surely it's madness not to have the vaccine.
1	Lol! They're like if the entire country is vaccinated that means the virus can't spread or mutate!
0	Turbo cancer, excess deaths that increase with each booster, myocarditis, reproductive health problems, neurological disorders and neuropathy â€¦ itâ€™s the gift that just keeps on giving!
1	the mrna vaccines are safe, shut up about it already
0	Bioweopon that is approved as a poison by Australian tga regulators, with provisional acceptances. Not made like traditional vaccines at all. New technology that the World economic forum says in another youtube video they will link you with AI. Have fun guys.
1	Our entire family each got the jab multiple times with no side effects.
1	With such an infectious disease, without vaccine, there's no safety in numbers.
0	People aren’t open-minded to the people that don’t believe in it. … Some people are just so close-minded, that they think that because the people on TV are telling you to get it, that you’re supposed to get it. I think that’s what bothered me the most. It was like, I have an opinion, I do my own research, I talk to my doctor, and just because they tell you to get it doesn’t mean you just run right out and get it.
1	Got vaccinated as soon as I could, got every available booster since. I caught COVID last winter and only got a sore throat for two days. Fixed my shed roof and did a load of other DIY home work jobs whilst I was isolating. Overall 10/10 hardly any symptoms did not die, would recommend
1	I work in a supermarket so I've been on the frontlines for the entire pandemic. I'm risking exposure every day. Here, I need to wait until the end of July to get my first jag. It's so unbelievable that there are adults in the US who've been offered their jag and choosing not to get it. Go on everyone, get your shot. Please. For me.
1	I don't call them antivaxxers. I call them pro-plaguers.
0	I'm astounded so many people took an untested and new procedure. Did people get swept up in the mania of 2021? Do people not think? I also hold companies responsible who forced this on their employees.  Whoever coerced someone into taking this should be held responsible
1	It’s not bad at all and it doesn’t even hurt going in
0	Dear fellow purebloods. Stay strong
1	Love love love this message. I live in the U.S. and when my state randomly selected me to get the vaccine a few weeks ago I dropped EVERYTHING to go get it. Get ya shots people (who are privileged enough to have the option available to them right now)!
0	I am glad I watched this because it helped me realise that the shots are certainly unsafe.
1	Biochemist here. As soon as I heard they were rolling out mRNA based vaccines for Covid, I knew right away the academics behind the vectors and mRNA research from the late 90's were in line for a Nobel. Well deserved!
1	Covid vaccination reduces the risk of developing long Covid, while current sufferers may experience an improvement in symptoms after getting jabbed, a comprehensive review by the UK Health Security Agency suggests with the vaccinated half as likely to develop long covid as the unvaccinated. (UKHSA press release 15/2/2022
0	the Covid-19 vaccines have caused thousands of sudden deaths in otherwise healthy people
0	Its a brilliant explanatory hypothesis from Dr Clancy. It makes sense to me and I hope the researchers and medical profession take it forward ASAP.
0	Natural immunity over everything
1	"And yet ignorance is an enemy, even to its owner"
0	My mom got auto immune condition after vaccine of two doses. Our life has become hell.
0	those who will take covid vaccines are doomed.
1	Yay !! I got my first shot of Moderna! I'm going back on 3/26 for shot #2 . Very happy you got your vaccine! Need you safe !
1	I’m not against getting the vaccine , I feel you have the right to choose ! What I am against is the government mandating it and forcing it on everyone
0	Side effects include: immunity to certain diseases, longer life, and a healthier body. Take vaccines only once every few months or so. Do not take vaccines while smoking or operating machinery. If you are antivax and you know it, clap your hands.
1	Since vaccines have so many benefits and low risks, I basically don’t consider their side effects.
1	I am so excited to get my two under-12 kids vaxed!
0	Tbere were worrying effects in my very local area but not made public (1st vaccines given). I chose to refuse vaccine , despite being pressured. I am so glad I kept to my decision
1	I got the vaccine 3 days ago. No side effects besides a sore arm. I did this to ensure the safety of my family who I only get to see once a month.
1	Anyone who refuse to be vaccinated will not be treated if they have Covid19 or not no medical aid will be given , it is vital that folk get the vaccine and help wipe out this evil virus. We need to pull together and only then can things get better and back to normal service. Shame on those who refuse to be jabbed unless a medical reason not to.
1	do not people who are a part of civil society have a moral duty to have their vaccines? Some people want safety without going through the harsh element, that being a jab in the sholder. I happily had three jabs, and they did not bother me at all. If I am asked to have anti covid jabs every year I would be fine with that. Vaccines should be made mandatory for all, save for those people who have a doctor's diagnosis that vaccines are unsafe for some of their patients
1	I got vaccinated for my grandparents, who are at higher risk. Let's protect our loved ones.
0	More than 80% of people in my  country didn't get vaccinated. I am happy about that.
1	The beginning of the end of COVID!
0	Not a single dose here, and never had covid. My decision looks more attractive by the day
1	When did we start taking Medical advice from Politicians? This country has gone nuts.
0	I don't trust none of these people I won't be getting it neither will my daughters.. Period
1	vaccinating against COVID is a moral obligation. It's important to protect ourselves and our loved ones from this dangerous virus.
0	I got my booster(Moderna) 2 weeks ago and i still suffer from pain in my left chest and fatigue. Before the booster i was superfit and had no infection for 5 years...
1	I hate that people are still saying shit like “you can still get Covid with the vaccine so what’s the point?” The point is so you don’t fucking die or suffer for weeks in the hospital. Heard some lady on NPR call in with that gem this morning. They basically ignored it but I was kinda bothered they even chose to play it on air.
1	I actually really enjoyed this. I am pro-vaccine but I also believe that people should have choices and understand that this is a super complex issue.
0	Those Medical Professionals should be fired.
1	Even worse, they're forcing everyone to be slaughtered by mandating vaccines.
1	Vaccines go through rigorous testing and monitoring, and millions have safely received their doses. I'm proud to join the fight against this virus.
0	Parents! Think this out! Exposing your children to this overhyped Covid19 virus is far less risky than exposing them to this dubious and untried vaccine.
0	BEST ADVICE....  DON'T GET THE SHOT!!
0	I personally know 3 people who’ve developed blood clots after the covid vaccine one ended up in ICU, the doctors on 2 occasions said to the people that it was the covid jab
1	Instead of spreading fear, let's spread awareness. Vaccines are a triumph of science, not a conspiracy
1	Seeing the elderly and frontline workers getting vaccinated fills me with immense respect for the resilience of our society.
0	But yeah, I'M the idiot for trusting scientists and doctors and getting the vaccine.
1	We’ve never turned down any other vaccine for any reason.  I see no reason to do so for this vaccine. So my kiddo had it as soon as it was approved for his age group. He was 2.
1	Vaccinated and proud! My son and his wife had COVID, but we took precautions. Let's all stand together by getting vaccinated for a safer tomorrow.
0	I'm concerned about the pressure to vaccinate without full consent
0	Those shots gonna be the death of us not covid
0	More of the same next year from the #WorldHoaxOrganisation except nobody believes you anymore after the #CovidHoax even the fully vaccinated are waking up to your lies
0	Pure blood here, keep the faith No vaxxers
0	DOn't even worry about the countless cases reported to VAERS of blood clotting, seizures, inflammation of the testicles and ovaries, myocarditis, bells palsy, tinnitus, permanent residual brain fog, hearing loss, tinnitus, cancer, kidney failure, Guillain-Barre Syndrome (when your immune system attacks the nervous system), tumors/lesions under the skin... no big deal!
0	Met a young woman at a bar who took the Pfizer vaccine and became completely crippled two days later. I wonder if she reflects on what vaccines have achieved.
1	OMG, they have a vaccine for the flu &; a treatment!!! Are you seriously trying to conflate #COVID19 as having the same risk as seasonal flu!!! You know that wrong &; dishonest! ~500,000 will die with #COVID19 vs the seasonal flu unless you start testing &; mitigating!!
1	I can’t wait to get vaccinated!
1	enormous health impacts of COVID-19 vaccines, which have huge economic benefits,"  Christopher Whaley, PhD, Brown University "In terms of lives saved and economic value, the COVID-19 vaccination campaign is likely the most impactful public health response in recent memory."
1	Nice vaccine. I’m glad it was announced this week and not last.
1	The COVID-19 vaccine is a testament to what we can achieve when the global community comes together for a common cause.
1	I appreciate what you guys do. I have been vaccinated twice. Biontech! I waa tested positive 3 days after the second vaccine. On my 11th day of the quarantine. Just felt tired and my fever climbed up to 37 at the first day and then it literally stopped. Havent felt anything since then.
0	Yet another side effect: Granuloma Annulare

1	Praise Science
1	"I recently got vaccinated, and only my arm hurt that day. I slept well that night, and the next day everything was normal. I'm not sure if it's a side effect, but I've been sleeping deeply in the afternoons, and I don't usually nap. However, I've been feeling very well."
1	Myself, my husband and our 2 children had covid at the end of January. My husband and I are fully vaccinated and our 16 year old will receive her 2nd dose soon. We are patiently waiting for something to be approved for our 11 year old son. Vaccines rock!
0	The amount of relief I feel that I didn't get vaccinated, even though I was pressured by almost every member of my family, is absolutely indescribable! I feel sorry for those who got it though. Best of luck, they're definitely gonna need it.
1	Vaccination is a collective responsibility that contributes to the well-being
1	Vaccines  plays vital role in offering the best protection  against viral and infected disease.WHO plays and work an important  role for a developed,developing,underdeveloped nation for providing safe and healthy environment  to the global community of Planet.Thanking you WHO and their team.
0	I'm glad I trust my gut feeling, the pharma industry is absolutely evil. I have companies still denying me just because I'm unvaccinated, its crazy
1	Umm, do people know how COVID vaccinations work , it doesn’t mean you won’t catch it, it means if and when you do, the symptoms, hopefully won’t be as severe because your body has already been exposed to it and has built up some immunity to it. Duh…..
1	showed mRNA shots really can work.
1	Just got my COVID-19 vaccine today! Feeling grateful for science and looking forward to better days ahead.
0	yeh if you pro vaxers could go ahead and tell me when covid is supposed to kill me. thatd be great.
1	I’m glad i got all 2 of my shots i dont want to get long term health effects
0	Most COVID-19 mRNA Vaccinated people don't know that damage to blood vessels was one of the MAJOR risks of the mRNA Vaccines.
0	By not taking the jab, I'm 100% safe from side effects and 99% safe from covid.
0	These shots are hated and no educated person would take them.
1	I got some serious joint pain in my vaccinated arm. Knuckles were sore for 3 days. All good now, but I was pretty achy after the Pfizer vaccine. Just sharing in case someone else gets these symptoms and needs reassurance.
0	I got deathly ill from covid but i decided to let my body fight it off! I was hospitalized and was a oxgen tank for 3 months! It took me 6 months to fully recover after i got better my doctor asked me if i wanted to get vaccinated and showed me the statistics from the phizer and modera vaccine they didnt look good so i decided not to get it!
0	I didn't follow your advise early on and never got any vaccine.   I almost lost my sister after her 2nd dose and have seen sooo many people  die, it's by no means a coincidence.
1	Thank you for taking the time to show others that are misinformed that the vaccines ain’t that bad.
1	it was very difficult to refuse vacination for more than a year.I was tested 3 times a week during that period.But in the end,it was good decision not to take the vacine. On all the tests I was negative.I didn't had Covid ever.
0	you're not truly free if the government forces you to inject their concoctions!
1	Stop wasting time, energy, and resources treating those that choose not to get vaccinated.  Let nature take its course.
0	was told by my childs cardiologist to get us all vaccinated to protect him! I'm beyond furious! He was fine , but we're still suffering side effects!
1	I was in close contact with 3 customers and then 3 family members. Also a full weekend and in  car for 13 hours with our nice with covid.. never cought it. Took the visor vaccine, didn't feel any symptoms now our little girl started school again and brought Covid home, finally we gonna get it. Nothing.. I even slept with her the first 3 days because she wasn't feeling so well..
1	I know whatever decision we make as parents is in the best interests of our children.  There is no right and wrong in this. But I do believe we should be given a choice.
1	For the first few minutes i had something like a nerve reaction and was feeling like high on drugs
1	Have never once regretted NOT getting that thing.
0	I’m 70 years old and have such a strong immune system I never get sick. It must be frustrating for you to know that I laugh at all the idiots that run around still wearing a mask.
1	Just got my booster shot! Feeling safer and more protected.
0	My mom had GBS and it was the scariest thing Ive seen in my life. If not treating it right away right when the person first starts experiencing pain, usually starting from their feet, the person can die within a few days. The person can develop pneumonia quickly because of weak immune system. She still suffers tingling and numbness on both of her feet to this day, but her soreness are not as present before. Some people are lucky and all of the tingling, numbness, and soreness disappears for them after being hospitalized. Afterward, she had to go to physical therapy too because after being in the ICU for awhile, your body can no longer move. My mom actually struggle for about 6-7 months in total just get back to where she is today. But bare in mind that GBS is no joke. Any neurological side affects are no joke and should be taken seriously.
0	Concerned about the vaccine's effectiveness against new variants
0	I refuse to be a guinea pig for Big Pharma. I'll stick to natural remedies instead.
1	God bless America 🇺🇸 and the world. Finally a vaccine
1	In 2 weeks, i'll be receiving the second jab of this Pfizer vaccine. I just love these people for being able to develop this masterpiece. THANK YOU!
0	He plays his cards close to his chest. I'm unvaccinated and I'm furious my kids were duped into the whole protect granny lie.  My eyes have been open the whole time. Now I personally know a whole load of people who have died and suffered because of this experimental vaccine. I pray my kids don't develop any harm.
0	Flu is killing thousands more people yearly even with many getting vaccine yearly. Covid-19 has scared sane people into foolish activities. WTF?
0	Doesn’t matter to me what’s in it because I’m not going to take it
1	i’m getting my vaccine next week i’m so grateful to be getting it!!
0	So sad, I am glad I did not get the jab
1	So Adam could possibly be one of the few that have had genuine adverse effects. It's a shame that he trusts the untrustworthy John Campbell who felt the need to lie about being vaccine injured himself in order to pique the interest of his followers on his YouTube channel.
0	The scariest thing about the jab is that it stays in your body for as long as your alive, triggering all types of things that would have stayed dormant, neatly packaged away - protected by our natural immunity. Scariest part is that the person will never know for sure when it will trigger
0	I've had zero Covid jabs. If I had ever contracted the Covid virus in the past, it would have been so mild that I didn't even know I had it.
1	I really don't understand what stopping COVID vaccines for U.S. Troops is supposed to accomplish.
1	Here in Thailand, we barely have any vaccines, people are desperate to get vaccinated, and less that 10% of us are vaccinated. It feels very unfair that Americans just shoo it away when so many of us would have it in a heartbeat.
0	Never got a shot by a doctor with gloves on. Vaccinated people still getting covid-19 and giving it to other people!
0	I tried to follow the science, but it was simply not there. I then followed the money, that's where I found the science.
1	Let’s demand vaccine equity so that everyone can be vaccinated
1	If trumpster covid deniers and antivaxxers would do there part it would be shut down.
0	All I know if someone died after getting drugs from anyone they are legally accountable. Don't let the corporations have more benefit of the doubt than a citizen does.
1	I chose to get vaccinated today. Get yours too!
1	I got mine today. Can’t wait to be a zombie extra in the new zombie land movie next year.
1	Well be happy we are still waiting in Germany for the vaccines....
1	Vaccine side effects were minimal. Totally worth it for the protection!
1	I mean 66% is still really amazing. With flu shots only 40-60% depending on the year.
1	I can’t wait to get mine. My sister had her first shot on Saturday
0	My wife is 31 with her booster - she tested positive yesterday. Be careful folks!
1	I got vaccinated for my children, so they can have a safer environment.
0	I don't know any unvaccinated people that have any regrets!!!
1	Getting the vaccine felt like a moment of hope.
0	Anti vaxxers have always been the conspiracy lunatics who actively effect their environment
1	I had covid in the early days.  Very mild.  My husband had the worst case but recovered.  We are both doubly vaccinated.  Just do it.
1	Really hope the Novavax traditional sub-unit protein vaccine is available by end of Sept.
1	Our freedoms have come with all the sacrifices that our military have made but why is it so hard to ask Americans citizen to their part so we can return to life as normal but it shows you who the real patriots are and who really loves this country.
0	We were told take the vaccine and you will avoid getting covid. Not true. The bbc should be defunded now.
1	Happy to have gotten the first dose of the #PfizerBioNTech COVID-19 vaccine yesterday!
1	I’m pro “show your vaccination card” before flying. I’ll still wear my mask and be kind to the flight attendants and those around me. This is not hard. What’s hard is loved ones dying of Covid.
0	My fiance and I had covid early December. He had terrible chills, headache, muscle aches. It affected me like a mild flu. Apparently I had it last May as well and the urgent care didn't call with my results so I checked my one chart and I was positive. Thought it was just a cold. Both unvaccinated, kind of overweight in that "high risk" category. Healthy people in shape younger than us developed "pre existing heart conditions" after getting vaccinated. Don't be test subjects over a virus with a high survivability rate
0	I knew one elderly man who died soon after taking the shots more than two years ago. I think I've gone full libtard but I don't see anyone else dying around me
0	I didn't need the shot because my perfectly functional immune system sorted the issue out for me.
0	The media is pushing vaccines without considering the risks
1	Moderna and Pfizer are new and we are not sure yet about long term safety although we think they will be safe, they were tested at the beginning of the pandemic before we had multiple strains.
0	The biggest reason for me is they can't make me do anything I don't want to do.
0	The risk of vaccine side effects is not worth it.
0	There are millions of deaths from it not being reported as such, especially by compromised medical professionals, who would be admitting fault, which they purposefully will not do.
1	I work from home and only leave my house once or twice a week. My wife is exactly the same. We both still got vaccinated.
0	Myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle, very rare)
0	Natural immunity is still the best
0	Both my parents nevvvverrrrr ever had heart trouble …until they received the covid 19 vaccines.
0	I'm not against vaccines, but shouldn't we get to choose?
1	I hope America continues to donate your excess vaccines to developing countries. People are dying in my side of the world and we want to get vaccinated but no vaccines available
1	I love to see it. Getting a vaccine is personal protection and community protection.
0	Vaccines should be considered war crimes, and the creatures recommending them should be in front of a firing squad immediately.
0	No one regrets not getting it. Many regrets getting it. Thats all we need to know…
0	People have ruined their immunise systems relying on a vaccine that doesn’t work as you need 6 of them and if you neighbour is not vaccinated it doesn’t protect you. Despite you neighbour who is unvaxed showing no signs of sickness wake up people
1	First of all, COVID-19 is a serious disease. It can cause a range of symptoms, including fever, cough, shortness of breath, and even death. In fact, COVID-19 is the leading cause of death in the United States.
1	I'm grateful for the opportunity to do my part in protecting my granparents
1	I never thought of it as “freedom”or not freedom but survival. I wanted the vaccine long before it was available and every day I hear about unvaxed dying.
1	I appreciate the tireless efforts of scientists and researchers who have worked diligently to develop safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines
1	I’m so happy my parents care for me and give me the vaccine every year or so, i could have had parents who refuse to vaccinate me, but they make sure I’m safe :)
0	I am glad I watched this because it helped me realise that the shots are certainly unsafe.
1	Don’t confuse your google search with my medical degree
0	Yes! Another vaccine I can happily ignore. No jab, no heart attack!
0	Better off without them at this point.
1	I am so looking forward to them! My child will get them because of autoimmune problems and I will get them because I am the immune shield for my child.
0	People who vaccinate are just sheep following the herd.
0	So relieved that I didn’t crumble, I remained strong and do not have that poison in my body !!
1	I had 1st shot of Pfizer yesterday morning, no severe sad effects, just felt hungry and about 30 minutes light headache in the afternoon. I have been on diet. Yesterday I had to eat three good meals, with carb, red meat, vegetables, fruits, nuts, fish now I feel normal.
0	Strange how a cure for cancer has never been found or sought for so badly by our government who care for us so much , because if there was they would lose money , so why should we trust something now being forced upon us from our caring government
0	I feel sorry for thoes who think they had to take the jab to keep there job or school attendance or any mandated pourpose but if everyone stood together they could not have forced it on anyone. But it's not to late to join in the fight with all the protest against mandatory vaccination.
1	Anti Science Anti Vaccine Conspiracy hypothesis are spreading like wildfire on the internet
1	Vaccines have been our best answer to disease in history. It is definitely safer than getting COVID- you are only getting the mRNA for the spike protein part of the virus.
0	My hesitation towards the COVID-19 vaccine stems from the rapid pace at which it was developed. I'm concerned that this speed may have compromised long-term safety studies, leaving us uncertain about future implications.
0	I'll never regret being unvaccinated.
0	Why you even get a vaccine? A spicy curry more dangerous then covid
1	I'm done feeling sorry for non-vacxers. They put healthcare workers, their loved ones. And anyone they come in contact with. They also put enormous increased presure on already highly stressed healthcare works. While I don't wish them harm, I don't feel sorry for them either when it goes very bad for them. The reality is there are ramifications of the desicions they have made. Sometimes these ramifications are long-term and sometimes permanent. We are all aware of the potential downside snd must live with them.
0	Personally, I think this was just a trial run to see how compliance would be with the general population.
1	Medical personnel everywhere support getting vaccinated for COVID
1	Get better soon
0	Prefer natural immunity and focusing on health and wellness
1	Why does it have to be that tough for some folks?
1	Vaccines aren't just about individual protection; they're also about preventing transmission to others. Even if you feel fine after infection, you could still pass the virus along to vulnerable individuals.
1	I believe in the power of collective action, and getting vaccinated is one important step towards ending this pandemic
1	I got vaccinated because it’s the most effective way to prevent severe illness from COVID-19.
0	Swollen underarm glands (in the arm where the injection was given)
0	I trust my holistic remedies over vaccines any day.
1	Never been so excited to get a shot (or two)!
1	BREAKING NEWS. FDA GRANTS PFIZER COVID19 VACCINE FULL APPROVAL. ~ THIS IS NOW WHERE ITS GOING TO GET ROUGH. COMPANIES THAT HAVE BEEN ON THE FENCE TO MANDATE IT? NOW THEY JUST GOT THEIR CONSCIOUS CLEARED BY THE FDA. THIS IS A MASSIVE PIVOTAL POINT.
1	Absolutely. I trust science more than crazy antivaxxers on YouTube.
1	got vaccinated because I believe in the power of science and the importance of collective responsibility
1	Vaccines are one of the biggest Public Health victories in human history
1	Vaccination is a beacon of hope. It reduces severe illness, hospitalization, and death. Join the fight, get vaccinated, and help save lives!
1	Vaccines are a cornerstone of preventive healthcare.
1	Y’all are in a weird cult. I have no regrets taking the mRNA vaccine. I also have no regrets about taking many other vaccines that work e.g. anthrax, polio, malaria etc etc
0	I've been thinking about getting inside vaccination point and see the procedures first and then devise a plan to skip the jabbing procedure. It might not work out but still doable compared to bribery or hacking database. However, i'll have to risk again for 2nd dose.
0	i had one vaccine and then i came to my senses
1	new vaccine options bring a sense of relief.
1	Vaccination is freedom from fear. It's our shield against the virus
1	Vaccines are our best shot at ending this pandemic
0	Imagine these vaccines don't work on incoming variants, and WHO has to make another vaccine and all those fully vaccinated still need another dose lmao the business keeps going
0	Although it might be a regular vaccine, there is no need for it because there is no such a disease. But, how are you really gonna believe whether those people in the media saying that they got vaccinated? Also, its effects should last 4–5 years at least.
0	vaccines are a tool for population reduction – it's all part of the plan!
1	I just hope I get to be safe until I can get it
1	I believe you.....
1	Got my first Pfizer jab about 22 hours ago. Feeling great, no side effects except for a slightly sore arm. Apparently the second vaccine hits harder though with chills fever and fatigue (which is a normal reaction after getting vaccinated).
1	Yes, and not just cancer… they may be able to make an HIV vaccine from mRNA within the next year
0	I' m choosing not too because of how fast it's been developed and I'm very happy with my decision after seeing the outcome of others still contracting COVID with being vaccinated!
1	I'm so glad I got vaccinated against COVID-19. It was the best decision I could have made for my health and the health of my loved ones.
0	"Business is business. The top management of these organizations should be judged and condemned for crimes against humanity."
0	So you didn't mention the total number of deaths reported by the CDC: "More than 369 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines were administered in the United States from December 14, 2020, through August 30, 2021. During this time, VAERS received 7,218 reports of death" Is that an acceptable number? Many think this is grossly underreported.
1	Approval for use will at least take a year to 18 months, but hopefully the wait won’t be too long.
0	Think about this- Allergic Reactions to a Vaccine is a big deal and a story when you can be fired over not taking one.
1	"I am scared to get vaccinated, but I want to do it. Please tell me what to do."
0	What you need to know about the Convid vaccine…. Don’t get it for a start
0	It was never about health and it was all about control.
1	I had the Phizer vaccine Friday. All went well
1	let's expel unvaccinated people from the country.
0	With all that we now know about the Covid-19 clot shots today, the people that took those clot shots are now ashamed to admit they were suckered!
1	Was exposed (a few weeks ago) and didn't get it. Or so I though!) Didn't get any of the normal congestion symptoms, but had THE WORST gasto intestinal symptoms 'yellow butt pee', nausea). Had the vaccine. Got over it in like 2 days, tested negative. Pretty sure I had 'a touch of it' but came out okay. I believe the vaccine helped. Now fighting a killer cold (not COVID, tested) but still. Cold seems (at this point) worse than actual COVID tbh. Still not regretting getting that shot!
1	I am from Nepal, I had taken covid shield for the first dose and after 5 months had  Astrazeneca as second dose but I had no any side effects. I think ,We should be mentally prepared before taking the vaccine and take it positively.
1	An applause to everybody who contributed in making and giving out these wonderful stuff.
0	Mandating this shot is as unreasonable as mandating condoms if you ask me
0	Yes, an investigation should be done on why wealthy communities had access to the vaccine first.
0	And yet in Massachusetts, they've outlawed menthol cigarettes because they're so dangerous. The DPH is still recommending routine vax booster updates. How's that Harvard degree working for you...?
1	I just got my first vaccine today. No side effects so far. Thank you to all the scientists and researchers around the world for making the vaccine available this early and thank you for this channel for spreading the science. Yes, it’s definitely OK to be smart. Science rules!!!!
0	This is the information that I was given Then was asked to join a queue We didn’t have enough time to read all the information  We were told it was SAFE!!I didn’t want a #CovidVaccine, it was too new
0	Many who are now suffering from vaccine damage wished that had not had the vaccine regardless of what the WHO said.
0	Big Pharma profits off our fear of diseases. It's a business.
0	My gut feeling told me not to get the vaccination, but I was given a really hard time about it. Thank goodness I listened to my gut!
0	Who else got fired cause refused to get a covid-19 vaccine?
1	If my nurse was an anti vaxxer, I would rather run out of the hospital than be treated by her
1	If FDA approved, I am taking the vaccine.
1	today i laid my baby brother to rest, he was only 18 and way to young to be taken from us. i miss and love you so much buddy. please remember how special and loved you are. please remember how serious covid is everyone and get your vaccine
1	Not gonna lie, I was skeptical about the vaccine, but after seeing the results, I'm all in.
0	If you like being sick, and are tired of being alive, keep getting boosted.
0	You are on notice for the promotion of a dangerous product.
0	So low hospitalizations are correlated with vaccination or is omicron itself is less lethal covid variant
0	Not enought details they are hiding something....
1	I'm relieved that there's finally a solution to this pandemic
0	Thank god I've never had any covid vaccines!
0	Because I got tested 6 mos after I survived COVID and I have antibodies.
1	Antivaxxers are not owed an audience for their bs. We have heard all the nonsense before and it has all been proven false. Vaccines save lives, there is no legitimate debate anymore
1	Funeral= $8-$12 thousand, Vaccine = Free
0	Vaccines are just a way for the government to control us!
0	I refuse this poison!
0	All lies not safe other problems leading to death
0	The vaccine weakens your immune system so no
0	Literally still not getting it :)) and doesn’t cure it, doesn’t end it and it doesn’t make me immune (: no thank you.
1	GET THE VACCINE YALL!
0	The increase in the number of vaccines administered raises concerns about the cumulative impact on health.
1	Can we get this cool new vaccine yet or not
0	We should be given a choice, it's our bodies, not the government's!
1	Calling it now. When death rates go up, they will blame the vaccines.
1	All states need to investigate Covid
0	I am glad I watched this because it helped me realise that the shots are certainly unsafe.
0	So in these clinical trials are they like giving ppl COVID after vaccination? Shit crazy.
0	I don't think the benefits of COVID-19 vaccination outweigh the risks, especially for certain age groups.
1	Got my first dose. no side effects just a little pain where I got injected but I feel lik nt using my arm
1	Way ahead of you I am back and I'm happy to say that I'm with both got vaccinated back in May let's continue this #VaccinateTheYouth
0	Its all about the money...
0	I never took any Covid vaccines
1	Damn…to be unvaxxed in the US or Europe at this point (young children and immunocompromised excluded), you really have to wake up every morning and choose stupid
0	Feeling unwell (malaise)
0	I will never be a lab rat.. let’s go Brandon!!
0	We don’t care if you’re “nice” to us or not. We’re not the ones with the side effects from the shots.
0	I won't be taking one, ever.
0	More vaccines, yay! We can totally believe the claims this time, totally.
1	Thank you. This is the resource I've been waiting for to send to people who are hesitant right now.
1	Vaccinateded and proud! It's not just about me;. It's about community well-being.
0	I am unvaccinated and don't have any regrets.
0	I hope the BBC will run a show featuring vaccine injured people and those who have lost loved ones. We love to hear their stories and they deserve to be heard. You can't pretend they don't exist and they are not conspiracy theorist!!
0	NO ONE WANTS THE POISON!
0	Pfizer down to 39% efficacy. I'll pass on that one.
0	The best decision I ever made in my life was to not get that jab. Healthy and happy 3 years later, while a number of family and friends were not so lucky after getting bullied into getting it. It's anything but rare.
0	Covid vaccines are "safe" it seems as if we are living in parallel universes.
1	I don’t argue with people about the vaccine anymore. If you aren’t vaccinated let’s keep our friendship on the phone. Don’t come to my house or anywhere near me
0	And the premature mortality snow ball is getting bigger and bigger.
1	A vaccine is about reducing the effects when you get a disease
0	“Coronavirus is known as a virus that can mutate reasonably violently ... the new virus will become more contagious, but the variants that cause severe symptoms may die out, Dr. Derek Gatherer.” would make a vaccine virtually useless. #COVID19 #COVID2019
0	25,000 people in the US died from the flu in the past 4 months alone. COVID19 could kill 15 times more people based on current death rates. 43% of adults STILL don't even get an annual flu shot, yet they're clamoring for a COVID vaccine. #CoronaVirusUpdates
1	Thank you!! I'm getting it as soon as I can (probably in like 2 months)
0	My immune system works just fine thanks. And for all the people who think it's my responsibility to protect those with compromised immune systems, just stay home. If YOU are scared, YOU stay home. If I wanted to take responsibility for other people's safety, I would be a cop and get paid for it. This society isn't worth the risk.
1	Right decision I just send both my son and daughter to take the AZ 21 &22 yo
0	The amount of relief I feel that I didn't get vaccinated, even though I was pressured by almost every member of my family, is absolutely indescribable! I feel sorry for those who got it though. Best of luck, they're definitely gonna need it.
0	I say take the vaccine if you are suicidal!
0	Y'all really just let a big corporation with no liability inject you with an emergency use experimental technology vaccine for what? Literally nothing has changed besides you got a sticker and a card showing that you've been obedient.
1	everyone with an actual understanding of immunology took it... and we're fine.
1	I got vaccinated to protect myself and those around me, especially the elderly.
1	omg guys i got the vaccine now im magnetic
0	Top Genomics Expert Testifies: Covid Shots Cause Cancer
0	Welp yall got poisoned and you and your children and your children’s children
1	I can honestly say, I took my second dose of Pfizer and feeling very optimistic. No side effects. All staff that were vaccinated super fine. My life in God's hands. I took vac with open positive mind set, to help the world against this vicious Covid. So one person Can change the world. I am blessed.
1	I'm vaccinated against COVID-19, and it feels like I've taken a powerful step toward protecting not just myself, but everyone around me.
0	I am unvaccinated and don't have any regrets.
0	Vaccines don't even work. It's all a big pharma scam.
1	I feel more sorry for the people who have to share spaces with unvaccinated people with no choice.  Vaccines aren't 100% effective which means their effectiveness for each vaccinated individual increases when more people take it.
1	My mom is 2 years away from retirement with a cushy, easy, well-paid job. However it’s in a hospital and they’re talking about requiring everyone to get the vaccine. She’s said if it’s required she’s going to quit and get some Walmart greeters job until she can officially retire. Like what. She’s seriously illogical and there’s no talking her out of it
1	No one here is denying vaccines work, they do, but well **enough** to be a better option? Safe enough? Safe as possible? Well as possible?  That is the question
0	I know 5 people that now have ALS, all vaccinated. You will never convince me that did not cause it. It's horrible to watch what they are going thru. One is my mother in law. It started 6 months after taking it.
0	Quite astounding. Honest concern in your voice and seething anger evident. This is again a shockingly true indication of the clinical malfeasance widespread at the time. Attended my first funeral of an old school friend, who died suddenly on the golf course (SAE). So pleased to have skipped all that nonsense and living as a pure blood.
1	Ok look up how many people on average die a year from vaccines or get a mental condition or allergy soon after being vaccinated and how many people are saved a year from vaccines and compare them, see which is more.
1	Proof that not everyone is stupid.
0	You can’t see long term side effects in the short term.
0	I don't have it. I don't trust anything from a company I can't sue.
0	I felt exactly the same and it was actually a pretty scary time, realizing everything I had built up might be lost because I would never succumb. I also work for a conservative company and 90% of my fellow employees were on the same page. No jab, and turned out we all held out long enough for common sense to make a comeback, if ever so slightly.
1	I have had both vaccines thank you to the scientists
1	I don't regret getting it five times. I still haven't gotten covid. Maybe I'm just lucky.
0	I never got vaccinated , my wife gave up a new job 2 days before she was due to start as we both said no vaccine..I am now very grateful we never got vaxed.. I am 72 and got Covid but was sick for just one day ,God gave me a great immune system and  trusting my instincts and an all knowing God was enough ... Many of my vaccinated  friends at church got sick  with Covid and some of them for weeks... Thankfully all seem to be doing well now
0	Covid vaccines are not safe.They killed my friend.
1	New research shows antivaxxers don't care about science... Or facts in general
0	Shame on everyone who coerced or pressured people to take that shot.
1	Some people are corrupted by conspiracy and some have eaten too much falsehoods that they think a shot will make you a 5g hotspot. It's hard to get through to them, but eventually, at least hopefully the realization arrives.
0	if you pro vaxxers could tell me when Covid is supposed to kill me that would be nice
1	I'd rather deal with any side effect of vaccination than covid that's for sure!!!
0	I have a recommendation I would never take the shot
0	When a person/government is forcing you to do something , you don't have to research or prove anything, you have to refuse it by default because they want to hurt you.
0	The best decision I ever made in my life was to not get that jab. Healthy and happy 3 years later, while a number of family and friends were not so lucky after getting bullied into getting it. It's anything but rare.
0	I am so relieved I did not take it and neither did my husband or kids.  I can sleep at night knowing that poison is not in us.  It disgusts me that people who hang onto ignorance because they are scared it's in them can't look around at all the people speaking out.  All the young people who collapsed and died is heart breaking
1	Got the shot. It's a step closer to normal life.
1	To all the keyboard doctors spreading vaccine doubts, your "research" doesn't trump real science.
1	I got my vaccine and am fine
1	Its mind boggling to see how far we have come in terms of science, technology and medical field.
1	hate that we have come to a time when we shut up a Doctor and tell them they are wrong because we have "investigated"
0	We’ve been lied to again. Maybe the 1918 Spanish Flu was like Covid in more than one way…
0	Lol it is way to late to be pushing this kind of propaganda
0	"Many vaccinated individuals, not all, are getting sick now."
0	So much talk that the vaccines work.rubbish
1	I got my vaccine 2 days ago and it was the Pfizer one, I only had a sore arm and a little headache and fatigue on the first day, on the second I only had a sore arm but now I barely feel it now, my 2nd dose is in 6 weeks
1	This is nice. I hope it continues to work well.
0	I've been skeptical on the vaccine from day one. I don't like that it was rushed although I understand why it was. First we were told that once we got it we wouldn't have to worry now pfizer is coming out and saying we will need a booster every year like a flu shot.  I'm going to let it run its course. If I see a need to get it I will. Until then I'll let everyone else be test subjects.
0	Kids were more likely to die in a car accident than from COVID yet we locked down their schools, forced them to wear masks and told them it was for their benefit. It's not nice to lie to children.
1	Yet MORE EVIDENCE showing vaccination can lower the risk of Long COVID.
1	Literally every country in the entire world knows the vaccine works and people on the internet like this comment section go “uhhhh you’re just blindly believing it”
1	The clot shot does slow the spread
1	Boosted and feeling like I just got a superpower upgrade.
0	I still don't trust vaccines,
1	I had J&j vaccine. This video helped me a lot not to be worried about anything any more .
1	As someone who had covid last year and just got vaccinated, trust me, the vaccine side effects are WAY less painful than actually having it.
1	This is great news. I'm only saddened that nearly half of Americans aren't interested in taking the vaccine
1	Considering doctors and medical providers get them themselves in order to practice medicine, that is one hell of a conspiracy. Guess they think the elites don’t need medical assistance either.
0	Biggest mistake of my life was taking the shot to get my wife out of lockdown. 2 years later and I still have heart problems and thrombosis in my legs. F the entire medical mafia.
0	I don't want to be a guinea pig for this vaccine
1	I've had enough of the vaccine hesitancy. Let's get real and protect ourselves.
0	The best sign that you can trust the content is when YouTube posts their light blue misinformation links to a carefully crafted Google page.
0	As bad as things are, it could be worse. You could be vaccinated.
1	Volunteer's dedication, dispelling vaccination myths, empowering informed decisions.
1	We are still having Covid-19 active cases at 61 362. Important to wear your mask and get vaccinated. Don’t listen to conspiracy theorists
0	It blows my mind how many people actually took the jab. It was so obvious what was going on...
1	God, fully agree. I’ve been holding off on getting vaxxed because I wanted to make sure the info I had on the vaccine was correct and stayed stable over time. I also didn’t have money for a vaccine. Now that I know it’s free, I’m getting it.  Thanks to this, I’m getting it this week.
0	They should ALL be stopped NOW!An End To COVID Vaccines
1	Vaccination is a gift we give to ourselves and others
1	Got mine and the flu shot last week. Wanted Saturday but my local Walmart didn't have both. So I got it Friday after work at the one closer to downtown.
1	43,500 people tested in 6 countries and no safety concerns have been raised.  Damn. This is definitely promising news!
0	They shouldn’t be recommended to anyone that's healthy including adults.
0	My Dad died of vaccine acquired immune deficiency brought on by the Pfizer vaccine. That was in 2021. I'm glad it's finally getting attention.
0	FDA - Federal Death Administration
1	vaccine gives most people a high level of protection against virus
1	The development and distribution of vaccines have been key factors in responding to pandemics.
0	Jesus. Its been almost a year long flu. It will gradually get better without the need of putting yourself at risk with these microship infused work of the devil
0	My heart said no; my head said no. I said yes to my instinct and said no to the 'vaccine'. Happy and healthy.
1	People are forgetting that it's not just about them, we're all here on this planet together fighting off this thing. I don't understand how people can be so selfish.
0	Of course some people were hospitalized, as they are with the flu. I’m just saying the scope of the problem was grossly overstated
0	Might try burning sage around my house to purify the atmosphere and create a protective barrier against invading viruses.
1	Better than death
0	“Omg the new Myocarditis 3.0 is here! Better get my 8th booster  strokes out and dies
0	You're hilarious if you think I'm taking even 1 single vaccine
0	Someone who was perfectly healthy then had 3 heart attacks and other symptoms . It is perfectly reasonable to assume it might be a vaccine injury.
1	For the life of me I can’t figure out what she is trying to reference? The data on vaccines is overwhelming. So what obscure bullshit is she referencing? She can’t be so dumb to think vaccines don’t work?
0	It doesn’t have any benefits!!! But the risks are astronomical!!!
0	Anyone out there vaccinated and still alive?
1	FINALLY got my 1st dose! I've never been so excited to get a shot in my life! #vaccinated #moderna #unodose #COVID19Vaccine
1	I think the problem is ultimately the education about these vaccines. The information needs to be transparent, clear, relatable, and easy to understand. This kind of video needs to be more accessible and shared around on common media so people understand.
0	If it doesn't make it go away forever why take it, that's what I say no.
1	Vaccine's a godsend. Feeling hopeful for the first time in ages.
1	I’m glad I got it, never understood the resistance. Data is solid on it, mRNA has been in develop for ages.
0	This information is terrifying to me as my daughter sustained a TBI in May 2020. She has had a remarkable recovery but the brain injury program pushed and pushed her to get vaccinated. I worry that we will see decline.
1	I hope this pandemic has convinced some of the anti vax commuinty that the world without vaccines would not be a good place.
0	5 reasons... 1) it is still experimental, 2) adverse reactions, 3) unkown long term effects, 4) no liability protection, 5) pharma criminal histories.
1	I got the 3 shots and I didn't get sick any time.
0	Imagine believing it's covid and not damage from the triple you know what.
0	It's actually health authorities misinforming the public when they falsely claim that “vaccines are safe”.  How can anyone claim that vaccines are safe when they have never been tested in the gold-standard double-blind placebo control trials using a genuine placebo like every other drug is required before approval?  **No Placebo in Vaccine Safety Tests**  They found that ***none*** of the current vaccines on the schedule have any meaningful pre-marketing safety data. And worse, there’s ***never*** been a trial of a vaccine against a genuine placebo…the toxic vaccines were only ever compared with an equally toxic comparator (ie. another vaccine or the vaccine less the antigen only), rather than against an inert saline solution. Shockingly, such deliberate and blatant scientific fraud was not only permitted by medical regulators but fully endorsed as part of the licensure and mandating of vaccines on the schedule.

1	Vaccinating children protects them from serious childhood illnesses.
0	I had so many family members try to tell me that I was reason that COVID persisted because of not getting vaccinated. They are not saying that now.
1	the politicization of mask wearing during this pandemic is one of the most moronic phenomena i have ever observed.
1	It's so safe it's exempt from liability! Wow
1	I am so happy for Pfizer and the people receiving vaccines! 😁
1	What a time to be alive! Vaccine in record time. Thankful
0	The pushing is one thing, what is sad is there are and always will be people who are so insecure they want to be part of a group, any group, and membership to the vax group is easy and virtuous
0	Am an intelligent free thinking, free breathing adult who has researched the dangers of an experimental dangerous UNNECESSARY drug and decided I dont want to die.
0	Excellent post. I do know many People who died and People who had strokes. I expect more People died from the vaccines than Covid itself.
1	I caught COVID before the vaccines were available and it almost killed me. I caught it again 2 years later after the vaccines and it was like having a cold. I’ll take the vaccine every time!
0	Went to the hospital last night as I was getting intense chills and bbm was high again. Felt real weird. All test came back normal and Doctor is pinpointing it to vaccine. All he could recommend is hydrate and rest since everything was normal. I feel ok but just shaky. I'm on week 3.   I will not be getting 2nd dose. My teaching job is not mandating it. If I do decide to go back since I keep having issues with my health
0	I've read about rare side effects, and it scares me
1	That’s great! My father works in my local hospital and he got the first part of the vaccine today.
0	By not taking the jab, I'm 100% safe from side effects and 99% safe from covid.
0	I had a bad reaction to my first Moderna vaccine .   Doctors were not only unhelpful but could care less.  I went through 6 weeks of physical therapy due to intense dizzy spells.  Then said I should go ahead and get the second shot . No thanks.
1	This shot can help us get back on track, just take it
1	It’s fine if you don’t want a vaccine, as we all have our own personal choice but don’t run to the hospital backing it up . These poor doctors and nurses need a break !!! They have become numb to all he death they see because “people want to have their freedom . ” My friends husband ( an er doc) says people are still dying , mostly all not vaccinated.
0	Please stop the overkill of vaccines. Not necessary.
0	If that were true, why can't people get a sample to analyze it for themselves in a university lab
1	Lies. I totally got autism from it and died.
0	natural immunity is superior – vaccines only weaken the gene pool!!!
0	Devastating. This vaccine has devastated so many families.
0	I've had a severe migraine for the last 2 days. I have always been healthy and treated my body with respect, self care, and love. Low fat, low sodium, low sugar, no alcohol, no drugs, exercise etc. Why do I feel we are being punished because we want to be healthy? Will this BS ever end? Just wow!
0	your arm hurts because of the TRACKER
0	Did you include the vaccine gives myocarditis and a destroyed immune system?
1	Feeling so relieved after getting my vaccine. It's a game changer!
0	I had heart issues after my first Pfizer.
1	The study shows that vaccines are not perfect, which is not what anyone is saying.
0	I can't believe I'm still alive after my third winter of severe illness and death.
0	While I was in the drug store yesterday, I heard 2 little kids screaming because they did not want their booster jab. The dad finally gave up and took them home. That was a real victory for those poor kids! How can any parent trust the government after all the lies? I don’t get it.
1	Shoutout to all the hard work of scientists over this last year making vaccines. We really take their work for granted.
0	Stop saying they’re safe, but affective when they haven’t gone through clinical trial. This is ridiculous. We are not stupid.
1	Vaccine efficacy is proven. Let's not gamble with our health and the health of others.
0	Shortness of breath
0	Nobody is vaccinated against COVID because the shots on the market are not vaccines. If they were, the disease rates would have fallen off a cliff as people became immune.
0	Idc if you disagree and think I’m stupid I’m not getting this vaccine for a looooong time.
1	I am a 6 year old and I got vaccinated. On December 3 2021 I got a vaccine I got 5 shots of vaccines, and I'm a fear of injections but really I didn't cry when getting injected by a vaccine
1	vax is killing everyone! Source: youtube
1	This is what you call proper explanation of the vaccine efficacy statistics.
1	They are safe, get vaccinated and be thankful for the free shot. When antivax becomes illegal, people will eat each other for just one free vaccine.
0	How long were these “rigorous tests” again?
1	Immunizations are crucial for maintaining a functional and productive society.
0	Has this vaccine undertaken rigorous testing with a large sample group?
1	I vaccinate because I want to reduce the strain on the health care system
0	My mother died 20 days after her vaccination - 24 hours after vax - she got thrombocytopenia and died a horrific death. Never will forgive for what happened.
0	They have to test it in their own country, because phifzer came to Kano and inject innocent people which resulted to being hand cap, Kano state government win the case at High court
0	What do you mean another? Never had the first.
1	Can’t wait for vaccines to be available so we can get back to our normal life.
1	If you don't get your child vaccinated then I would say you should homeschool your child instead of spreading possible diseases to other children etc just my thought.
1	I got vaccinated and had no issues at all. It's a small step to protect myself and others. Vaccines for the win!
0	THANK GOD I DID NOT GET THE VACCINE
1	I don’t think it was necessary to get for most people but it clearly doesn’t cause any long term issues for the vast majority of people who get it.
0	They can’t even give this garbage away fior free
1	Just got my latest vaccination. I have been sick for the last 24 hours. Feel like hell. But I'll take the vaccine instead of Covid.
0	First shot might be fine. Second one hell no it's going to mess you up covid19
0	It is absolutely criminal that employers require this vaccine.
0	My mom got auto immune condition after vaccine of two doses. Our life has become hell.
0	I don't want to be a guinea pig for a vaccine that's still under emergency use. #NotAnExperiment
1	"Long term effects" in vaccines has historically been a range between days and weeks (specifically 4-6 weeks at most), we ALREADY have more than 6-7 weeks of observation from the clinical trials showing that there aren't any significant side effects most of the time, if anything, chills, fever, headache, and tiredness are the side effects. The pfizer vaccine even decays rapidly after only a few days in the body.
0	You forgot to mention the heart attacks people are getting... Good job at not being biased!!
0	Avoiding infection is the best chance of reducing the risk of long covid.
0	FDA approves and authorises anything that isn't actually in the benefit for humans...😉
0	The vaccine turned out to not work and still does not work
1	He's fortunate to have the good sense to get vaccinated.
0	"I work in a rural area, almost no one got vaccinated, and the pandemic didn't affect them despite being close to large population concentrations."
1	The vaccine represents hope and resilience. Let's all get on board
0	Mrna vaccines just experiment on people and most time unwillingly experiment
0	"At that time, there were many scientific voices warning about the danger of vaccination!!!!"
1	I got the vaccine in April and still got covid in august. I’m on day 4 of the virus and my symptoms are minimal. My only annoying symptom is the loss of taste and smell. The vaccine has helped with the symptoms.
1	I’ll wait to get it. The front line workers need it more I do.
1	🙋♂️I have had every shot that has been available since 2021 to now!  I used to read the anti-vaxxers crap now I just ignore their crap and wait to see their names in the local obits column!
1	Thanks, Mr Kevin McCarthy, I believed in your great news !!! I can't wait covid -19 vaccine. KEEP America great !!! May God bless United States of America. ♡♡♡♡♡
1	You might not die from covid… but look at that quality of life…. After Covid-19 illness… you are finished.. don’t be idiot.
0	If masks work, I don't need a shot -- If shots work, I don't need a mask. Since neither one works, I don't need mandates telling me to do the two things that don't work.
1	There are myriads of people on this planet that immuno-comprised for some reason. It is very likely that many of them cannot take the vaccine. The more people that receive the vaccine the safer it will be for this group.
0	I know someone who got COVID after being fully vaccinated. What's the point?
1	Vaccines have played a pivotal role in extending life expectancy and improving quality of life.
1	Got my shot and feeling like a boss
0	I've heard of cases where vaccinated individuals still experienced severe symptoms.
1	This vaccine is looking really promising from a safety point of view.
1	Joining the vaccinated means joining the fight against Covid-19.
1	Hey guys. If we actually hit the vaccination thresholds we could have without some of you crazy anti-vaxxers breathing covid on everyone….the vaccine would just about prevent the spread! Because vaccinated individuals get mild cases if they get it and are less contagious
1	95% save I like those odds
0	All I have to say about not vaccinating is: Are you a doctor? If you are a doctor, and are still antivax, then  you are unqualified
1	Good on mayor for accepting the facts when educated about it. Some people will double down instead of admitting they were wrong.
0	I RESISTED THAT SHOT FROM THE GET GO. MY GUT INSTINCT SAID - “NO DANGEROUS”. I NEVER TOOK IT. THANK GOD!
0	Unvaccinated. Unmasked. Unmuzzled. Unafraid.
1	I'm an older adult, and I'm at higher risk of complications from COVID-19. I'm grateful for the vaccine, and I encourage everyone to get it, especially if they're in an at-risk group
1	Please good people, go get vaccinated before going out to groove.
0	They forgot the myocarditis, blood clots, and strokes.
0	I've already had COVID-19, so I don't see the point in getting vaccinated.
0	Two mice were having a beer in a bar. One asked the other ‘are you gonna get the Covid vaccine?’ The other one says ‘ heck no, they haven’t finished the testing on humans yet.’
0	The Nazis had zyklon B and gas chambers. The fascists of the 21st century, mainly the elites at the WEF and the Democrat party have the China virus vaccine.
1	I chose to get vaccinated. I will save the community and so will you if you get vaccinated.
1	it relieves the stress on our Healthcare system and reduces deaths! Get vaccinated and boosted!
1	It still boggles my mind that they are not doing Covid vaccination clinics in schools
1	Republican thought leader, Alex Jones, said last year that 90% of the people who got the vax would be dead by now. These fascists are wrong about literally everything.
0	Imagine these vaccines don't work on incoming variants, and WHO has to make another vaccine and all those fully vaccinated still need another dose lmao the business keeps going
0	The end... " You don't vaccinate people with chronic fatigue syndrome, you are just putting petrol on the fire" THANK-YOU !! This was me in April 21. I'd been ill since Mar 20 and In April 21 had Chronic Fatigue. My vax invite came in April 21, I had 11 invites actually. Didn't do it. I'd been ill for over a year, no answers from Drs or Consultants and well my gut instinct was telling me if spike protein does this to me already, didn't seem like the best idea to ask my body to make more. I don't even want to think what may have happened. And I had to put up with people telling me "Just get the jab" "Don;t be silly" etc. The look of disgust from some people when I said I wasn't vaccinated and one was a male nurse at my local hospital , gave me a proper lecture. I wasn't;t well and didn't;t want to get into an argument as his made was well and truly made up. Thanks you John and Robert.
0	i have had a severe near-death reaction to a previous emergency approved vaccine during the US's last pandemic  i am a healthy person that will not die from covid  i dont want a vaccine that is brand new and hasnt been tested over time. i dont care if its safe right now, usually vaccines are tested for 10+ years before they are released. i dont get any vaccines that havent been tested for this long  i havent seen covid seriously affect or kill anyone they way it says it does in the media...
0	I never got vaccinated, I got Covid 3 times. I had chronic asthma and my Doctor told me if I didn’t get vaccinated I was going to die. I have never felt so great in my 40 years of chronic asthma till now, I have not used my inhaler for the last 11 months. I trust God and I knew that I didn’t need to get vaccinated or probably won’t be here to tell my blessings.
0	This is wonderful they should give it to the people who want it and leave the rest of us alone
1	got my second one Wednesday morning! having some pretty bad side effects still but it'll be worth it in the end!
0	On my way to get my 26th booster. I love science!!!
0	I said from the start don,t get the jab, looks like i and others were right,,profits at any costs,they need to be in court,Boris and co and the who etc.
1	Natural selection is survival of the fittest.  Vaccines are an attempt to make the weak survive, and in doing so make the once healthy weak.
0	Kudos to all of you who didn't cave to the pressure and refused the jab. You're my people.
0	I didn't get the vaccines , got covid and had no symptoms that were any different than a copd exacerbation. Treated the exacerbation as usual and all is fine. Didn't even have any covid/flu like symptoms.
1	Hospitals require vaccinations for major things. Even as a housekeeper, I was required to be vaccinated against certain things. Therefore, its imperative these nurses be held to the same standard.
1	My husband and I will get the vaccine as soon as we can so that we don’t spread the virus and make healthcare workers lives more difficult.
0	I never knew that not wanting to put unknown things in your body and being scared to get it cause you might get something, wasn't a good reason not to get it. Wow lol
0	Autism rates are skyrocketing because of vaccines!
0	These people and their lies are disgusting. How do they sleep at night?
1	It's really infuriating when they say shit like "WELL YOU STILL GET SICK." Yeah, you may get sick but the chances of you shitting yourself on a hospital bed while on a ventilator are slim. Funny that they won't care what medicine is being put into them once they're in a hospital
1	It's all fun and antivax till the lungs die
0	Risks you say? Well when businesses were mandating it for people to work without them knowing the risks. I'm just so grateful that I never took the vaccine even though I lost my 20 year career at a hospital. I'm still alive. Had covid 14 months ago . No problem. My symptoms were less than my friends
1	I'll be first in line for vaccination
1	Choosing to vaccinate is choosing science over fear.
1	Take the vaccine!!
1	Very grateful for the vaccine, it has saved over 20k lives in NZ.
1	I'm 24 I work in Health Care and I got my first vaccine in December and the 2nd in January. Getting the vaccine and see everyone of of my coworkers get the vaccine had been incredibly helpful with my anxiety
0	Does it contain fetal lung tissue cells from aborted babies known as HEK 293? And does it have propylene glycol (antifreeze)?yes it does
1	I've wondered, if COVID-19 really gets rolling with major numbers of infected and dead, and a vaccine becomes available, how will the anti-vaxx crowd react if they're really scared of getting the virus? Will their fear of getting the virus override their fear of vaccines?
0	Love how whenever there’s a video about the Covid-19 vaccine side effects, it’s always 1 sided. The support side. Everything else is CENSORED!!!!!
1	But Bill Gates injected Internet Explorer into the vaccine so they could track my Midi-chlorian count from Elon Musk’s starlink satellites…
1	If everyone got it, 90% is basically herd immunity anyways. Everyone won't get it, but now people will have a much lower chance of getting it than without. It's better than anything else we've been doing.
0	I am glad I watched this because it helped me realise that the shots are certainly unsafe.
0	dont fall for the bs. dont take the snake oil
1	I just wanna say, I am lucky to be fully vaccinated.
0	The was no election, Nazi. It was a Coup. Elections only take 24 hours. Not 5 days.  COVID19 was made in a Lab. Why would anyone get vaccinated for something made in a Lab?
0	I received two AZ jags (May and July '21) and since the first one my menstrual cycle has been all over the place where I used to be incredibly regular (over 1 1/2 years later it’s still not right). I was confidently told by a doctor after the first jag that the vaccine 'doesn’t affect cycles' and couldn’t find any information on it. It was nearly a year later when they first start reporting that there 'might be' a link between cycle disruptions and the vaccine. I’d been told it could be any number of things and that I was 'letting anti-vaxers get in my head', but honestly, my body hasn’t been the same since I had it. It took me months to get someone to believe me, and it wasn’t until I spoke to a nurse that she told me that she’d spoken to many girls and women who say there cycle has been affected. My body has been altered by it and am frustrated by anyone who tells me I’m imagining it. It’s like taking the vaccine was a watershed moment for me. When I think back to all the adverts saying it was safe and effective and look at everything that’s came out now, I wouldn’t have gotten it. The fact that they said confidently that it wouldn’t affect cycles to then saying 'oh wait, actually…' makes me think they didn’t even trial it with that in mind. I feel sorry for everyone who’s been affected by it and struggled to get anyone to take them seriously.
0	So many people still refuse to admit they were scammed big time
1	"Getting vaccinated is a responsible choice, just like wearing a seatbelt to protect yourself in a car."
1	My ex husband and his brother refused to be vaccinated. As a nurse, I tried to explain how vaccinations work, but to no avail. Both got COVID. My ex accepted treatment with monoclonal antibodies, but still refuses the vaccine. His brother DIED from COVID. Even being tragically affected by COVID, my ex husband continues to refuse to even wear a mask. It’s insane.
1	Cheers to science for pulling us out of the dark ages once again!
0	You misheard the PM, Dr. John. He actually said, "the vaccines are filling my safe."
0	The vaccine was not brought in for COVID.  COVID was brought in for the vaccine.
1	This is starting to look like the opening of "I Am Legend"
0	STOP! Do NOT take any of these mrna vaccines. Think of severe sideeffects and even the so called long covid can be one of the sideeffects. So, please do not try these vaccines.
0	You don’t need actual problems with the vaccines for this to work. You just need people to be stupid enough to believe there are problems.
0	Risks you say? Well when businesses were mandating it for people to work without them knowing the risks. I'm just so grateful that I never took the vaccine even though I lost my 20 year career at a hospital. I'm still alive. Had covid 14 months ago . No problem. My symptoms were less than my friends that are vaccinated.
0	Children should definitely not be vaccinated for covid. Those who think so are the really dangerous tinfoil hats that you should watch out for.
1	I am going on 90, not quite there, but I feel lucky that I'm able to take this shot and maybe last a couple more years. I'm just happy that I see so many people out taking their shots and thinking about other people. That's what it's all about.
0	We are doomed with this vaccine.
0	Had a severe reaction to the flu vaccine so I am very concerned that it could happen with the COVID vaccine
0	You say "Many many more under 50s died from Covid than had serious side effects from a vaccine" I very much doubt this is true
0	Covid-19 is most certainly real, but it's not much of a threat anymore. It doesn't help that the so-called vaccines are both ineffective and dangerous. Currently, I'm more concerned about GX_P2V.
0	Every day/week/month that goes by, Ive never been more confident in my decision to not get vaccinated.
1	I wish more people would watch this and understand that this is not poison this is not going to change your RNA. So many people don't understand science
0	Imagine having a dad who could check what illness you have then literally invent the cure. Lool
0	Nobody regrets NOT GETTING IT
1	Vaccine will do the job slowly and quitely. Have pateience and don't spread false information.
0	The unvaxxed don’t run to the hospital! It’s all vaxxed and the vaccines causes cancers to go “wildfire”. It’s horrific.
0	I’m good I don’t need a booster because I refused, in good judgement, to take the vaccine to begin wit
1	We all (hopefully) understand that the COVID-19 vaccines reduce risk of illness and death due to COVID-19. The problem is that videos like this don't bother to recognize the fact that risk management is not about reducing risk to zero - rather, it's about reducing risk to an acceptable level. You can always sacrifice more and more to reduce risk, but the question is how much? How much should be sacrificed, and what is an acceptable level of risk?
0	I'm concerned about the unknown long-term effects of the vaccine.
1	Because Conservatives and anti-vax/anti-science propaganda. A stupid population is easier to control.  Hanlon's Razor: Never attribute to malice that which can be adequately explained by stupidity.
0	What you need to know about the Convid vaccine…. Don’t get it for a start
0	Biggest mistake of my life was taking the shot to get my wife out of lockdown. 2 years later and I still have heart problems and thrombosis in my legs. F the entire medical mafia.
0	I’m immune compromised. Very serious underlying medical condition. Never worn a mask and definitely NOT having an experimental jab that killed my 43 year old friend!
0	Still haven't gotten it!
0	for a disease with a 99% recovery rate I think I wil take my chances with my immune system thanks.
0	My heart said no; my head said no. I said yes to my instinct and said no to the 'vaccine'. Happy and healthy.
0	If children under 18 only account for .4% of death from Covid how can anyone justify giving them gene therapy with known deadly side effects like myocarditis, blood clotting, and reproductive toxicity?
0	Assuming that the LNPs carried the mRNA vaccine into the brain, brain cells (e.g., neurons) might translate the mRNA into spike protein, which might then be marked as foreign by the immune system. With repeated vaccine boosters, more and more neurons might possibly be marked for destruction by the immune system over time.
0	"I had a bad reaction to a vaccine before, so I'm wary of getting the COVID-19 vaccine."
1	Vaccination is an ethical duty to protect others, especially those who cannot receive the vaccine for medical reasons.
0	I don't need to explain any of my medical choices to anyone
1	Got my vaccine a while ago, no side effects whatsoever. Same goes for my family members and friends.
0	Shivering
0	I never got vaccinated , my wife gave up a new job 2 days before she was due to start as we both said no vaccine..I am now very grateful we never got vaxed.. I am 72 and got Covid but was sick for just one day ,God gave me a great immune system and trusting my instincts and an all knowing God was enough ... Many of my vaccinated friends at church got sick with Covid and some of them for weeks... Thankfully all seem to be doing well now
1	People should have to stay home  and protection measures! If you can get vaxxed
1	iD dO aNyThInG tO pRoTeCt mY cOuNtRy
0	I regret TAKING IT. Worst mistake of my life!
0	As a nurse, witnessed people who have experienced blood clots, myocarditis, serious autoimmune issues following the shots, the doctors will not admit it's the shots and leave the person stranded. It's so awful, I can't recommend them (nurse).
0	Those people who did not get vaccinated are happy there's plenty of people that got the vaccination who are not
1	Got both moderna vaccines with minimal side effects worth it
1	I think the anti-vaccine movement is dangerous and disgusting
1	Having the COVID vaccine allows me to resume a more normal life. I can now visit loved ones, travel with confidence, and participate in activities without constant worry. It's a step toward reclaiming a sense of normalcy
1	For those worried about side effects, a sore arm for a day beats a potential severe illness any time
0	I will take my natural immunity thanks. Maybe you should read the pfizer information they tried to hide for 75 years about this vaccine before making a video like this. Truly sad how gullible some people are. Do your own research people. You don't need a medical degree to be able to read and understand for yourself. Doctors especially those that get a kick back will tell you anything just so they get that kick back.
1	My entire household has been vaccinated against Covid-19. I can't believe what happened as a result of getting the vaccine. None of us got Covid-19. If we did, we didn't even notice it.
0	I am an Australian and refused the vaccine and I am still being bullied and discriminated against.  Inhumane behaviour.
0	I am a human and I don't want any vaccine.
1	After getting vaccinated, I became more aware of the interconnectedness of global health and the need for international cooperation.
0	Spoke to a bloke I know today about the vaccine. He's about 5 stone overweight due to his bad diet, smokes an ounce of Old Holborn a day, drinks like a fish, works in concrete production in a cloud of dust (and when I worked there he never wore a mask) and he's worried to death about the vaccine. He say's  you don't know what's in it and how it's going to effect you long term, I don't want that shit in my body.
0	What you is saying is total bs. Two relatives died taking the vaxx aint puttin up with that shit
1	I normally don’t approve of anti-Vaxers. But in this case I think they are doing the world a favour by ensuring more vaccine will be available for those who actually need and want it.
1	We shouldn’t dismiss peoples concerns about the Covid vaccine, but we also shouldn’t dismiss the data. Myocarditis cases went UP with uncontrolled spread of Covid and DOWN after a vaccine was available. This data also corresponds with data on heart attacks in 2020.
1	As a hospital employee who admits COVID-19 patients into ER, I notice it’s the rich and politicians who get vaccinated. I hope to survive. When I heard hospital employees were getting vaccinated I was hoping before 2022.
1	We should get rid of vaccines to make people understand how good vaccines are
0	It’s pro. I’m saying it’s a shame that the need to tell people to vaccinate their kids is unfortunate
1	Actually at least in the pfizer trial once you are unblinded you get the vaccine if you got the placebo! I was in the trial and got placebo and i’m getting my second dose tomorrow :)
1	This is litterally what my family and I have been praying for! WE NEED THIS VACCINE ASAP
1	I think you didn't read, the vaccine is what killed them, you incompetent moron.
0	I am unvaccinated and don't have any regrets.
1	It's been over a year now, I wonder how different are people's opinion of it now? success or not? For me personally, I think the vaccine is a success.  Maybe next year I'll change my mind, but one thing is for sure, if you didn't get it, you don't have to worry about next year.
0	It is valid to be cautious and wait to know about the long term side effects. Let the sheep to offer themselves first....
1	I’ve been to a lot of funerals in the past months, and I haven’t been to a funeral yet for a vaccinated person.
0	i wont be getting the vaccine :)
1	Just got my vaccine, feeling great and grateful!
0	I feel like we're losing our rights to make choices about our own bodies. Where does it end?
1	My mom felt the same way until she was in a coma for two months fighting for her life. First thing she said we she came out of it was “I’m getting the shot”.
0	Worried about the long-term effects we don't know about yet
0	I WILL NEVER GET A VACCINE UNDER ANY CIRCUMTANCES
1	I know its a hard concept to grasp for this sub, but you’re getting the vaccine also for others.
1	For all the fake news out there… this will get lost. Anti vaxers don’t care about facts any way.
1	Wooo! Glad I got Moderna. I can still be the human sacrifice going to the grocery store since I'm the only one vaccinated. Downside, I have to get my ass out to the grocery store.
0	I knew in my heart not to take that vaccine. Unfortunately my son was forced to take it in the fire department. I pray for him, I pray for any relative or friends or family and everyone else that took that jab. It is straight evil from these evil people that want to depopulate this world. May they rotten hell
0	30000 excess deaths in Australia last year work that out for your self.
0	Who's going to protect us from the vaccination??
0	What do they do?  They don't prevent transmission, they don't cure Covid, they don't even prevent death.
0	ive met no one regretting not getting it
1	Pretty sure the long term effects of COVID are worse than any of a vaccine
1	I trust medical experts and scientists who support the effectiveness and safety of vaccines.
0	THANK GOD I DID NOT GET THE VACCINE
1	Well when you're dead you are very free. So well done.
0	And I'm glad I didnt get it. People have been dropping dead in record numbers since its came out.
1	Heh, they are having an argument in r/conspiracy about this right now. The way that anti-vaxxers see it, the elites want to kill off the sheep, and by not taking the shot they prove themselves to be the pure-blooded superior stock deserving of survival.  “They want people who can think for themselves” is the most common argument.
0	Safe and effective, tell that to the people who died or are disabled.
0	Someone who was perfectly healthy then had 3 heart attacks and other symptoms . It is perfectly reasonable to assume it might be a vaccine injury.
1	Because critical thinking is in short supply. For example I’ll have anti-vaxxers making the bananas claim that “I’ve never seen this many heart attacks/strokes in x population before” with x being athletes, young people etc., they don’t realize that heart disease has been the leading cause of death for decades and that they are victims of the Baader-Meinhoff phenomenon.
0	I don't trust the pharmaceutical companies behind these vaccines. Their profit motives concern me.
0	My whole body was sore where I could barely move for a few days after the first dose of the Moderna vaccine
0	Enjoy your boosters for life, feeble weaklings
1	#Covid19 has killed 10,000 of us, already. By the time the virologists walk into the field of battle with a vaccine which allow us to chop the finger off this bastard, our fallen will be in numbers comparable to losses in a World War, or even ALL War. (cont.) #CoronaCrisis
1	i wanna get the vaccine so bad but my parents won't let me, but i turn 18 in a month and i am fully ready to get vaccinated then
0	The gop needs to step up now and announce investigations into Pfizer , Moderna , J&J , Astra Zeneca , Bill Gates , Fauci , Birx , Collins , Wallensky , et al , for crimes against humanity and mass murder - after they declare the vaccine terror over and ban its use in all 50 states.
1	My grandmother was a polio survivor. she spent time in an iron lung and lost the use of her legs for the rest of her life. My grandfather lost hearing in one of his ears after a childhood bout of the flu. I had RSV at 2 months old, and have struggled with serve asthma my whole life. refusing to vaccinate your child against illnesses with common harmful side effects because of a one in a million side effect (or worse, a 'side effect' that has been THROUGHLY DISPROVEN) makes me enraged
1	Ah covid-19, simultaneously "just a cold" and a horrific bioweapon...
0	iInfo on vaccine ingredients and potential side effects is hard to come by
1	The best vaccine right now is the one you’re offered
0	I am a 67-year-old man who was in reasonable health until my astrazeneca and pfizer vaccines.
0	How to get brainwashed 101 first is getting the vaccine second is arguing with me about this comment
1	First shot done, minor side effects. Vaccination is a small discomfort for the safety it provides. Let's all get vaccinated for a healthier society
1	I have one simple question DO YOU THINK THE DOCTORS AND NURSES WOULD OF GIVEN YOU ALL THESE SHOTS IF THEY WHERE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR ITS HARMS?..
1	I would always want to be a good role model for my kids. Therefore im taking the fourth tomorrow. Sure some side effects but its not that bad.
1	All my family has their booster and the five year old is fully vaccinated. Grateful for this vaccine and the science and knowledge that went into making it.
1	I'm tired of these 'just got vaccinated' posts. Wow! Good for you for doing the right thing way too late and only after it personally affected you!
1	I’ve already had my first dose, and look forward to the second because I don’t want to get COVID-19, I want the pandemic to be over as quickly as possible, and I want to protect as many other people as I can from getting sick.
1	Totally safe I’ve received both Pfizer shots already
0	As someone who has dealt with chronic fatigue since 1993 - and who refused the experimental genetic treatments, this was one of the most fascinating interviews ive seen. Professor Clancy confirmed everything I suspected three years ago when they roled out the shots. He also revealed some important new information that gives hope to those still suffering from bio weapon injury. And he's given me new information to help in my own ongoing quest for answrs about my personal chronic health challenges.
1	A shoutout to the brilliant minds behind these vaccines!
1	"If you cant be vaccinated then you should become the best vaccination promoter of all, so other people that can be vaccinated may protect you." this is the best logical conclusion one could have about the theme.
1	Shoutout to the scientists who worked tirelessly to bring us these life-saving vaccines. #ScientificHeroes #LifeSavers
0	Had two Astra Zeneca shots Jan 2021, after the required time received a phizer booster shot, felt normal at the time. That night when in bed, got wakened up with both my bicep muscles aching, had to try sleeping without lying on them, by the time morning
0	When people find out they have to sign a full legal disclaimer to get their ‘safe’ vaccine they might wake the **** up.
0	I’m not an anti-vaxxer or whatever you call it, but I just don’t know enough about this one, it’s so new and makes my anxiety sky rocket
0	absolutely criminal. thank you so much Dr. Campbell for your continued bravery in bringing all these important issues to light.
0	I had an adverse reaction to the Phizer booster given to me in 11/21, batch no FK9413, for three days after I had cold extremities, hands arms feet & legs, shivering and loss of appetite. Suffice to say I have not had further vaccinations. Thank you for y
1	A huge thank you to everyone involved in the COVID vaccination programme. Dose 1 of 2. Ensuring the safety of every
1	And yet, this is possible worldwide because the people panicked, so the governments injected a hella lot of money (compared to what they did in the last decade -which is still clearly not enough-) and made the new techniques open to production. Some bad, some good, hope we will continue to trust medecine and progress.
1	I recently got my COVID-19 booster along with my flu shot and the only "damage" I had was a tiny bruise at the injection site and a bit of arm pain for 24 hours. Anti-vaxxers are stupid.
0	I'm glad I trust my gut feeling, the pharma industry is absolutely evil. I have companies still denying me just because I'm unvaccinated, its crazy
1	This two party system is really damaging aswell. In Germany we also have a right wing party whose supporters partially believe in covid conspiracies and are against the vaccine but at least this party only got 10 percent of the votes. The Conservative party and the other parties are mainly pro vaccine.
0	I tend to speculate the same as to why people are reluctant. Not because of the rare instances of death or the maladies the doctor prescribed, but rather the long term effects that might not develop for some time. Other vaccines such as what soldiers were required to take against anthrax are now apparently having devastating effects on a number of them.
1	If it allows me to leave the house for work without paranoia and dread, they can shoot it directly into my eyeballs for all I care.
1	Did you guys show the names involved with Epstein, yet?  That seems pretty important, too.
0	This is why I REFUSE the vaccine. I worked on the Covid unit at the height of the pandemic too & worked as an EMT.I was fine by Gods grace.
0	John could you please forward to the prime minister research papers and links so that he is made aware of the risks from COVID vaccines and remind him that asra zenicas vaccine was with held on safety grounds in America so either he is wrong or president of us is wrong they can't both be correct
0	I didn’t know people were still getting the shots after all those terrible side affects.
0	The way this whole thing was handled has turned me complete anti vaxx. I hope everyone effected gets justice.
1	Yup. My mom got Covid in her memory care. Thankfully we insist she gets her vaccinations and boosters as recommended by the doctor. It’s just a gamble with the others and the staff members.
1	Teacher, schools can be virus breeding grounds, vaccinated to protect students and their families.
0	look at canada,isreal they are 95% vaxed and still have people in icu cause of covid and other side effects
1	I got my vaccine already and I'm so relieved to have it. I hope more young people start getting vaccinated so we can approach herd immunity
0	I feel their pain...literally. Ever since I got my jab, it's almost like my joints have become severely weakened and I now struggle to walk.
0	Stop being sheep. Covid is only dangerous for the vulnerable! Don’t vaccinate young and fit people who at more risk of adverse affects from the vaccine rather than covid itself! The UK is almost back to normal.
1	COVID19 patients across the country who lie dying in hospitals. Unvaccinated people are *14* times more likely to die of COVID-19. Don’t wait – get vaccinated
0	I've always believed in listening to my intuition, and right now it's telling me to stay away from these vaccines
1	It doesn't PREVENT Covid, it lessens the severity of it. How sick did you get with Covid? It would have been much worse or deadly without the shots.
0	The only thing you need to know- DON’T TAKE IT!
0	He will be ok! There is a new mRNA vaccine Moderna are trialling. He will be fine!! Just like people who are vaccines by the effective Covid vaccine, but end up with Covid anyway…
1	I'm triple vaccinated and got covid. However was only mildly ill for 2 days. This article in my view decribes reality. Vacination reduces symptoms and helps speed up long term immunity.
0	Someone who was perfectly healthy then had 3 heart attacks and other symptoms . It is perfectly reasonable to assume it might be a vaccine injury.
1	I got my two shots and they both went very well. I will get the booster shot too one day.
1	I have to say I am relieved to see how many people want the vaccine. I was worried about the anti vax population but all I’ve seen so far is people begging to get it
0	I am an ICU nurse of 13+ years, and I will NOT be getting that vaccine! RIP to him and condolences to his family
0	Our family didn’t get the shots. We’ve all had Covid infection twice in 2022. They were like a mild cold for us adults, but amazingly short duration for my 12 yo. It lasted only 2 to 3 days for my kid. We’re so glad we didn’t fall for the hysteria.
0	There were a minimum of 380 cases of GBS reported in UK alone in first two months of vaccination program so actual rates are well underplayed in this study
0	I AM UNVACCINATED AND ITS GONNA STAY THAT WAY
0	Unvaxxed. Still haven't caught it, Still haven't been to the hospital and I go out and do things lol. All my friends that are once twice thrice jabbed all have caught it multiple times, and that's something consistent across the board that people have spoken about. It's not a coincidence.
0	I shall never willingly be injected with an mRNA jab.  If I get sick, I'll quarantine at home, and if I need to go somewhere, I'll wear a mask if necessary, but hard pass regarding mRNA jabs.  I'll trust my immune system instead.
0	You still doesnt have any proof that the vaccine was totally healthy and not rushed
0	Why isn't this video talking about the deaths?
1	The amount of people in the comments thinking they know more about vaccines, the science behind them, and that the doctor is somehow a hypocrite because he supports medicine is terrifying.
0	Now, now. Let's not discount existing precedent. A court that thought Jim Crow was totally cool said that a one-time, $5 fine for not being vaccinated was legal. Obviously that decision is infallible and means you should be rendered homeless and starve to death if you don't inject yourself three times a day because a pharmaceutical company tells you to.
1	people should have the freedom to decide whether or not to get vaccinated, but vaccines are also crucial for ensuring public safety.
0	Oh no, geeky old out. of touch man strikes again. You're part of certain old fashioned naive type you see often these days. Some people think they're God. Half of you geeks can't look after yourselves properly. Hence the fear. "Loves the TV" utterly brainwashed.
0	They need to promote healthier food and exercise as well. That way the body can fight it off better.
0	Imagine getting a vaccine
1	Vaccine check! Excited for what the future holds
0	Gives you a permanent and irreversible heart condition like a boss
0	The only thing you need to know- DON’T TAKE IT!
1	Together, we can overcome any obstacle, including COVID-19
1	This would genuinely be one of the most phenomenal achievements in the history of mankind if a vaccine is out by September
1	Last 5 years ranged from 29% to 40%.  54% for the latest COvID vaccine is very good.
0	A source tells me that Moderna is now reaching out to the families of people who died suddenly from their vaccines "for the sake of science."
1	About time . Vaccines in a pill form .. wow amazing
1	I am inspired by the global effort to develop and distribute the vaccine, and the positive impact it has had on countless lives.
0	I wonder if our blood supply is now tainted with the COVID vaccinated blood clots, etc ?
0	"I worry about the potential unknown side effects of the vaccine in the long run."
1	I am on the downside run of having Corona (1 quarantine week left) and I wish I had this before I got it. I’m glad someone is making headway. This virus sucks. So much worse than anything else I’ve had.
1	I had a crazy bad reaction to the MMR vaccine when I was a toddler. I still get all my vaccines. It's insane to me that people feel like it's some huge risk. It seems selfish to me
0	the sun would've done more to protect people from covid than the actual vaccine did
0	how about telling the world what Bill Gates Polio Vaccines did in India & Africa
1	I have now received both Moderna shots and the second was two weeks ago. My IQ has already increased to 165. I figure in a month a should be the smartest person on the planet. Thanks Moderna!
0	Sadly I took 2 doses..I regret , I don't feel anything but who knows. I will keep praying to Lord keep me safe and intact from any negative impact
0	I was basically forced to get vaccinated due to my line of work. Ever since, I’ve just been feeling off. My heart feels weird and sometimes I’m genuinely scared and worried that I’m either just going to drop dead or not wake up. Definitely didn’t feel like this pre vax :(
0	Cigarettes are safe. Agent orange is safe. Asbestos is safe. DDT is safe. - things once said by experts.
0	Hello! I am not super eduated on this topic as I've not taken a biology course in years, however, I am concered about any long-term effects the vaccine can have especially because unlike other vaccines, this vaccine has not had years of research to determine any possible long term effects.
1	I can’t think of any valid reason as to why I would choose to get the COVID-19 vaccine.
1	Common sense meets Science.
1	Thankful I am privileged to live in a country where I can get vaccinated so easily.
0	Let's be honest; most doctors knew this vaccine was dangerous a couple of years ago.
0	Eh. Every new vaccine, I’d rather wait a 2-5 years to see the long term side effects that arise before getting it.
0	"I am a retired nurse, and I never believed in those virus lies, let alone in immunization. I never fell for those lies, and I convinced several others not to do it. Today, I feel satisfied with my decisions."
1	Yes I will. At 72 y.o. I caught a new variant of Covid that the vaccines and boosters were not specifically designed for, and it kicked my butt! Without the immunizations/boosters I likely would have been hospitalized. The vaccines are changed to adapt to new variants as they occur – which viruses often do. I try to stay healthy, but I’ll take all the help I can get as age and PD make me more susceptible to serious illnesses.
0	Fever
0	Vaccines , no thanks . I want to live healthy .
0	Still not getting vaccinated.
1	Thank you for this, here in my state in México they are giving us the AstraZeneca shot, I was hoping for the Pfizer but whatever is good.
1	The vaccine has given me a renewed sense of purpose and determination to help others in my community access this vital protection.
1	I still got COVID after getting the vaccine but I don’t regret getting the vaccine
1	Vaccine misinformation is dangerous and irresponsible. Let's speak up and set the record straight
0	I should be able to decide for myself if and when I need any kind of treatment or vaccine. This mandate is taking away our freedom!
1	Thank you for providing factual information among the loud misinformation. There are so many potential Darwin awardees (anti-vaxxers) in the comment section it's hilarious. Who knows maybe I'll see them in the obits and have a laugh.
1	Doctors are asked us to take vaccine in our area and 90% people had taken and we are really good
0	THANK GOD I DID NOT GET THE VACCINE
0	I personally know of four that died after their first jab. Two others now have rare cancers after their jabs. Must be climate change!
1	Seeing the relief in my patients' eyes when they get vaccinated brings me to tears. We're saving lives, one shot at a time.
0	i had one vaccine and then i came to my senses
1	Feeling safer after getting my vaccine. It's a good day
0	Vaccines are literal poison. Watch how they say "Believe", it's all a Belief. Make vaccine manufacturers liable to damages, make "Doctors" have to give vaccines with prescriptions, making them treatment, therefore liable! They won't. It's a Con! Wake up.
1	opens door for vaccine mandates for ur kids and grandkids.
0	a lot of people in our area died after vaccination against covid, including those relatively young under 50 years old
1	What vaccine, that's supposed to be safe, had immunity from prosecution and hides trial data for 95 years?
1	I feel fantastic, blessed and highly favored – because I know there’s a pandemic going on and I just want to try to fight it the best way I know how. I think receiving the vaccine is the best way to fight it.
1	You’re an adult. If you don’t trust modern medicine, then don’t trust modern medicine. I got my vaccine, I’m fine. All my friends and family got it, they’re fine.
0	The vaccines are the cause of these illnesses not long covid
0	After my 6 shot do i get a free toaster?
0	I will wear a mask. I will try to protect myself from it getting into my body, but I am not putting any shots into my body again ever
1	vaccines have safe humanity
1	We all have the moral duty to get vaccinated against covid-19
0	Lost my medical career because I understood the science and knew better. I did not take the "Jab" and lost my career... Human's have made living so difficult that I'm so happy that I had no children in this world!
0	Why doesn't the mainstream do video reports of the 99+% of the unvax who recover fine at home
1	I am ready for the vaccine. The owner at my work just told us he will give us a paid week off once we all get vaccinated, I love that he is convincing people by way of incentive
1	There is a roughly 15x higher risk of dying from Covid if you are unvaccinated. Basically the same relative risk of dying from lung cancer if you are a smoker than if you never smoked.
0	I’ve literally only gotten the flu when I got the flu vaccine
1	I'm down 👍, I am getting my booster as soon as possible. I was the first one in my family to get the vaccine and i always encourage others to get it with Facts.

0	There currently are no vaccines, pills, potions, lotions, lozenges or other prescription or over-the-counter products available to treat or cure
1	I appreciate the peace of mind the vaccine gives me about my health.
0	The so-called "vaccine" is a lethal injection and is being used as a tool of genocide.
1	Same. Not sure what people's hesitation is. It's simple logic that's been around forever. "Hey there's high change your gonna get sick during there 3 to 4 months. You want this shot that's gonna make make that sickness potentially a lot less sucky?"
0	My mother died from a heart attack a few months ago after she took the vaccine. She’s never had cardiovascular problems in her life
0	Risks you say? Well when businesses were mandating it for people to work without them knowing the risks. I'm just so grateful that I never took the vaccine even though I lost my 20 year career at a hospital. I'm still alive. Had covid 14 months ago . No problem. My symptoms were less than my friends that are vaccinated
1	Just got the second dose a few days ago!!! Cmon Earth, we can do it!
1	Received a vaccine Friday and glad to get it. Caring for older patients daily and want to protect them. President Trump made this a priority! Youtube made an anti vaccine the top comment!! Sad! The virus kills old people and people with preexisting disease while sparing the young? The liberals close the economy while criticizing the vaccine?
1	cant wait for it to be available to anyone that wants it! i’ll be first in line
0	Stay away from me! My immunity that my God gave me protects me.
1	I’m happy that more attention and awareness is being brought to these issues. Reading stories like this did initially cause me to hesitate getting the vaccine but ultimately I trusted the science and figured I’d be better off getting the shot.
0	Pure blood here, keep the faith No vaxxers
0	I got my second Pfizer shot 5/21/21. I’ll never forget that date because what followed was the worst year of my life.
0	You are not up to date reading studies about the side effects and contaminations of those new vaccinations. Go read.
1	Yes I will get any and all boosters as they become available. The leading causes of death for PD people are falls and pneumonia.
0	The vaccine doesn’t prevent you from spreading covid, but telling the truth about that fact would prevent revenue for big pharma.
0	Before any covid “vaccine” was mentioned I had decided I wasn’t having one under ANY circumstances. Millions thought the same as I did. I would suggest none of us changed our mind or regretted that decision.
0	"I don't appreciate the pressure from society to get vaccinated; it should be a personal choice."
1	The vaccine is helping reduce the strain on our healthcare system.
1	I don't read fiction.  You know why?  Because reality is crazier than fiction.  They are designing vaccines with a hidden component.  They add certain neurotoxins to the vaccines, which cause a myriad of side effects, but several which are unnoticeable (like allergies, decreased brain and motor function, and diminished social skills).    Here's just 3 studies showing what just aluminum causes.  There's hundreds more. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2819810/  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22235057  https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0162013417304749  These effects are great for them because the allergy is just an excessive immune response to minor stimuli which creates inflammation which is the basis of all disease.  You need more medications throughout your life and probably die sooner.  Decreased brain and motor function means you're not as smart as you would be, so you're focused on every day living instead of fixing the issues of the world.    It's a way to keep the population dumbed down and passive, willing to accept rather than fight, when they abuse us.  It sounds conspiratorial, but look at everything.  Fluoride in the water.  Fluoride was used by the Nazis to pacify the victims.  Soy in everything now.  Soy contains phytoestrogens.  Estrogens lower testosterone.  Testosterone gives a person their sex drive and drive in general.  1,2 punch.  Lower sex drive means less children, lowered population.  Lower drive means you won't go out like a man and fight for what's right.  Sunscreen to protect your skin, even though they raise estrogen in the body.  Vitamin D raises testosterone, yet we're taught to fear the sun.  All of this by coincidence?  Well it coincidentally helps the elite controls the masses.  This latest push for mandatory vaccination is the most serious issue today.  They will literally have the ability to poison the entire population, and there is nothing we can do about it.  At any point they can mandate a new vaccine with some hidden nano-virus that activates genes that can kill you 10 years later from a random disease, and you won't even know it was the vaccine.  You'll think it was a heart attack or whatever.  We need to wake up.
1	Do you remember 13 people died in one weekend in a nursing home with Covid.  Your sick in the head... scared of the vaccine.  The next epidemic will be worse because of you denial
0	Dear vaccinated people, Your government gave you AIDS and is blaming “long COVID” for it.
0	My heart breaks for all the people who felt pressure to take the jab.
1	I believe in supporting scientific advancements that can save lives.
0	My best piece of advice I ever got from an elderly person was to stay away from mainstream healthcare for as long as your body allows.
0	None of these vaccine pushers will ever say that there is a problem ! Because when the next pandemic happens the people wouldn’t act like sheep and poison themselves!! And that wouldn’t suit the agenda
1	I have my three doses and I can honestly say that it has helped prevent me from getting sick. I used to get sick often but after getting vaccinated I’ve gone from getting sick four times a year to only once.
1	Got all my shots as soon as possible. My son and his wife had COVID, but we followed guidelines. Vaccination is a crucial step for community health.
1	Got my second one yesterday and it's such a relief to finally see light at the end of the tunnel.
0	Haven't felt the same since getting it. Yall are all leftist bots. It causes myocarditis and heart attacks. According to Doctor Antony Fauci and WHO
1	It's really sad that the "conspiracies " have tainted this breakthrough. And the future and scope of this kind of vaccine therapy is huge
1	I’m fully vaccinated, because I work as a COVID tester. I didn’t feel ill after the second vaccination personally and I am so happy and relieved that I can visit my grandma more safely. That’s what I’ve been most scared of, passing on the disease.
1	Seeing the positive impact of the vaccine on reducing transmission rates and severe cases is encouraging. I'm grateful for the scientific community's dedication in developing a tool that's making a real difference in public health.
1	I don’t know of anybody who got a blood clot from the vaccine. And all of my family and friends and coworkers got the vaccine.
1	I am fully vaccinated and boosted to stay out of the hospital and out of a plot in the cemetery. It will allow a person who really needs a hospital bed an opportunity to have it.
0	Never got vaccinated against this pandemic and I don’t intend to. The more crap I see the more I’m given reason for my decision.
1	It would have been much worse or deadly without the shots.
0	If a person or government is forcing you to do or take something, you don't have to do any research or prove anything, just refuse it by default, because they want to hurt you.
0	Stay away from the poison
0	There are no credible data to prove the long-term safety and efficacy of this vaccine. At this stage, it’s still experimental, even if all regulatory approvals are in place
1	Double vaxxed.. And I cried so glad to be  able to hug my grans again
1	the real concern is them passing it on to a family member or someone else who ends up seriously ill because it's incredibly contagious. Also it's definitely not just sniffles. While some people may feel like they just have a cold or the flu, many others even with healthy immune systems experience awful and long-lasting symptoms. Long COVID is an absolute nightmare. No one is denying it was a disruptive and surreal time for everyone, including students, but if measures can be taken to protect those at risk, they should be taken.
0	How many boosters before I get a free pizza?
0	But he has still not apologized for killing many of us with his vaccine, which negates a few things.
1	ya, vaccines tell your immune system how to fight off Covid. They also lower your chance of getting it 13x and your chances of needing hospitalization or death 21x and shortens your contagion period significantly.
1	The country can't get back to normal unless we reach herd immunity. Experts think herd immunity will come from 80-90% of people vaccinated. They're going to be looking at those numbers. All other reasons aside, you're simply holding society back by refusing to be part of that vaccinated population.
1	The more of us that get vaccinated, the closer we get to herd immunity.
1	The only one person in my area who died from COVID. She was an obese neighbor who got sick before the vaccine was created. Meanwhile, several other neighbors got COVID after the vaccine came out. None of them died and only had slight symptoms. All of them were vaccinated.
1	It's the best form of protection (besides isolation/ masks/ etc) against this disease and it'll mean you're body will have a significant advantage against the virus if you get it.
0	John Carmack (most famous for being lead programmer of the video game Doom when he was in his early twenties) said he took the vaccine because his medical concierge service recommended it. He probably pays a very high fee for this service, which makes him think he can trust it. Some people aren't just lazy, they are so focused on their work that they outsource absolutely everything else to an "expert". They will never find the time to look into your "conspiracies". They will live in their alternate reality until actual reality hits them so hard in their own face that they can no longer ignore it.
0	This comment section gives me hope in humanity. Being surrounded by people who blindly trust the government and think the government would never do anything to them has been getting on my nerves.
1	Vax seems like the ‘flu shot…some protection, not perfect. Very important for the elderly and likely to be tweaked annually.
0	I made the mistake of getting it (Moderna) so I could travel - in Sept of 2021. 38 year old male, never been to doctor for any disease or health related problem. Have now had chest pain for over a year, high bp, constant headaches and had to get put on beta blockers as well as getting stress test. Wish I would have listened to my instincts on this one. I hope all that got it make it through this alive. I'm glad the young lady didn't back down in the face of the smug interviewer.
1	Didn't have any problems with my vaccine.
0	Im just saying the whole point of vaccines is to prevent diseases it doesnt give you them you dumb shit anyway even if that was true would you rather give your child a weaker immune system or a death sentence at age 2
0	People STILL think its a scam?  Wow...  Really makes me question people who go into the healthcare profession. :/. Thank you for finding the time and energy to put out these videos!
0	I was a 72year old perfectly healthy granddad, working full time showing potential tenants around properties, involved daily in my three grandchildren’s aged 5, 10 & 13 lives. Swimming and playing walking football at every opportunity. Until having a life changing Pfizer Booster Vaccination Jab on October 6th 2021. I have never had Covid and ended up for 20 hours in A&E with breathing difficulties, which was diagnosed as heart issues, which where causing the breathing breathlessness problems. I am still to this day experiencing breathing problems. Brilliant coverage informative content and insight thank you Doctors.
0	Avoid experimental medical interventions
0	Terrible side effects widespread such as blood clots, strokes & heart attacks. Too awful. The truth must come out. Spirituality must prevail over darkness and negativity.
0	I haven’t even got COVID yet. Know why? Because I’m blessed 🤌🏿 I don’t need no damn vaccination. Ain’t getting one either 🤷🏿
0	How about I just choose not to, that's my simple answer, no reason, no skepticism, I'm neither republican or democrat, I don't believe in or follow politics, I just don't want to get it, people need to please respect that and move on, the amount of peer pressure being put on people for this is unreal, my peers back in highschool didn't even pressure me that hard to try weed or alcohol,, just told them no thanks and they left me alone, that was it.
0	I was never a fan of that
0	Dang look at all these bots saying “vaccines” are good
0	I developed tinnitus after AZ,which still persists.
0	My daughter is now disabled with Erythromelalgia. Diagnosed as being caused by her first shot of the Moderna vaccine. We had to go to Mayo Clinic to get her diagnosed. She lives with constant pain in her hands and feet. So frustrating. She was a healthy 21 year old.
0	Take it at your own risk.
0	I had 2 Moderna’s and have still not recovered fully from them, never felt soooo sick in my entire life and still feeling generally unwell. I had covid and for me was a bad cold my husband not vaxxed and had covid same time as I did and he wasn’t anywhere near as sick as I was. I was forced to have them by government here in order to keep my job. Feeling very furious with the whole stinking, lying, corrupt, misleading narrative.
0	Unvaxed and blessed
1	Vaccine hesitancy is understandable, but the science behind these shots is solid. Trust the experts.
1	"I am 68 years old. My husband and I got the AstraZeneca vaccine, and by the grace of God, we didn't experience any symptoms. Blessed be my God."
0	I personally know of four that died after their first jab. Two others now have rare cancers after their jabs. Must be climate change!
0	I refused to take the shots. I thought the way in which they kept pushing it was highly suspect. I kept getting phone calls from my GP and text messages asking why I hadn't taken it.  I was never an anti-vaxxer, up until this drama unfolded. Now I wouldn't take one ever again.
0	To the people running the scam, the magic number is however many it takes to depopulate you. The money made is set to infinite. The harm caused is set to ignored.
0	For these reasons I refused the vaccine- which my doctor agreed with 100%.
0	If only the vaccines worked
1	It's a public health crisis not a private health crisis. As a society we value freedom so we give individual citizens the choice, but the expectation is that people will make the right choice. For the public health, get the shot.
0	As a nurse, I witnessed my coworkers have significant adverse effects and then be met with stone silence by the medical establishment. That was enough to make me not want to take it.
0	This documentary sickened me to my core. And further convinced me that I would never take it. Well done to Nazarin for standing up for herself.
0	I got the moderna and one month later I now have kidney damage. Take at your own risk the line that it is 100% safe is a lie and afterwards you are stuck with the damage and the bills!
0	A moment of silence for to those who let the government dictate their lives
0	Had COVID, recovered well, no need for vaccination
1	Grateful for the vaccine developers and healthcare workers. Vaccination is our way out.
0	So many are battling autoimmune diseases after the so called vaccines, which are not vaccines but inoculations! We have no platform to tell our story! The doctors who treat us do not want to even report it!
0	I'm good, thanks. Trusting my body to fight the virus.
1	Vaccines have always been safe and effective.
1	Vaccines are saving lives.
0	It's all rather dodgy no matter how one looks at it...mmmmmmmm
1	Do you have some sources to back this up? From my understanding, vaccinations in the form of deactivated viruses, will make your body build up an immune system against it. It means that when in contact with said virus would not do anything in the future.
1	I am a current on-campus college student and I would also take a COVID vaccine as soon as offered, but I understand my classmates who don’t feel the same. To be clear, I’m not saying I support anti-vaxxers; I don’t. My friends who say “I’m worried about what the side effects might be and I don’t want to be in the first wave of the gen pop that gets it” that I get. But that also makes me really nervous: how and when will a vaccine be mandatory? Is it ethical to mandate it? How much of my community needs to be vaccinated in order to confer immunity? Anyway, i am really excited, but I still have questions. Thank you Hank!
0	I'm glad I said NO!
1	You can call yourself rich and educated all you want, but the fact you think your biased google searches trump 6 years of medical studies really shows how 'educated' you are. Go through medical school for 6 years and tell me vaccines give you autism, idiots like you should be sterilized, then you don't put other people's lives at risk.
1	As someone who planned on getting the vaccine regardless, thank you for the watered explanations for us non-medical folk!
1	Imagine refusing the vaccine and end up in hospital with breathing problems due to catching covid.
0	People are so quick to trust these pharmaceutical companies, but I'm not buying into their profit-driven agenda.
1	Next week I'm getting vaccinated, and again two weeks later. It's a vaccine trial, so it's not guaranteed to be completely safe or effective, but there's a good chance that it will be, and the results from the trial will definitely help others.
0	I don't trust the government to prioritize our health over other interests.
0	Haven't had a single vaccine, I was wise enough to know that vaccines usually take 5 to 10 years to be properly tested .. in the end I just caught covid and was feeling better after just 24 hrs .. now I have natural immunity.  Great video John , as always.
1	It would be considered too selfish not taking it. Like come on… 20 minutes of your life
1	I'm so grateful for vaccines. And so glad that new techniques are making them more effective and faster to make!
1	Covid is scary once it affects me personally
0	NOT EVERYTHING IS FOR EVERYONE! MY MOM DiED FROM HER JAB
0	I couldn't agree more. I am not taking it. I don't take vaccines at all.
0	Questions to ask yourself , are you made of natural stuff? Is the vaccine made of natural stuff? Is it safe to put something unnatural in your body via an unnatural method?
0	Not convinced of the safety standards of vaccine
1	I grew up when polio was a scourge. A relative was an anti-vaxxer, and one of her children was not given the Salk vaccine. Her child lived his life in braces, and over his lifetime, literally had millions of dollars spent on trying to minimize the damage from that one ignorant choice. Their family was bankrupted, and the entire family lived in poverty from that point on, spending every penny that they could, trying to undo the damage. There is a true cost of not getting vaccinated, but double-blind meta study has not shown any cost tied to getting vaccinated for covid, for the general population.Check for yourself.https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36936964/
1	It’s a well-known fact that the average life expectancy of humans before the modern era was less than 40 years️ With the spread of various vaccines, antibiotics, and other therapeutic agents, the average life expectancy has increased dramatically in recent years. Advanced countries which have better medical systems and facilities, have a notably high average life expectancy. We are very fortunate to live with the benefits of advanced medical care. I don’t understand why there’re so many idiots in advanced countries are against vaccines compared to developing countries people crave them.
0	"I'm waiting for alternative treatments and therapies instead of relying on vaccines."
0	My mother died from a heart attack a few months ago after she took the vaccine. She’s never had cardiovascular problems in her life
1	In the UK, 90% of the adult population has had the first dose and 76% have had both doses (as reported by the BBC). Israel’s numbers are very similar. I don’t know where you are finding the information, but more than 60% of those admitted to the hospital due to covid are NOT vaccinated. So out of the 10% that haven’t received the first dose and 24% that haven’t received both doses, they still occupy more beds than those vaccinated. A stark difference. Facts and statistics are very important. More people should get vaccinated.
0	Is the vaccine even working? Have doubts
1	Really important to be informed if you get the Vax. It takes planning.
1	I'm proud to have been vacvinated 3x. I will soon be getting the booster. I stupidly didn't get the flu shot and got the flu (or covid), but it was a mild case (lungs not affected). Doctor said he sees serious cases only with the unvaccinated. Lord, how stupid conservatives are. I can't believe these ignorant nobodies are critisizing this DOCTOR who went to medical school?! Did they even graduate from high school? I will now be getting regular flu shots. F stupid conservatives.
1	Take the vaccine now! What are your waiting for?!
1	I am not afraid of vaccines because I believe and trust in science
0	Kudos to all the uninjected!
1	The COVID vaccine's benefits clearly outweigh any potential risks. It's just like the childhood vaccines – necessary for public health.
1	If more had vaccinated, Covid would have ended in just two years.
1	All vaccines reduce in effectiveness in your system over time. (Don't worry, it's insignificant in a lot of our biggest vaccines and only a few groups need a booster later in life)
1	This is why I tell people that not getting vaccinated IS selfish. Medical resources are finite, precious and should be saved for people who can't get vaccinated or for people with other non-preventable ailments.
1	Hi - Thanks so much for keeping us informed. We are senior citizens and have had a total of 3 Pfizer shots. Yes we plan on getting the new vaccine, but think we will wait a few weeks to see some of the comments.
0	Four Canadian Doctors in the Toronto Area died last week. [Within one week of being offered their 4th dose of the COVID-19 vaccine]. Maybe three of them were part of the same vaccine lot like so many who are dying or getting injured.
0	A freshmen born in the 1990s volunteered to act as the subject for #COVID19 vaccine clinical trials, but with saying: I'm not a hero
1	I'm immune compromised and I can't wait to be one of the first to get it!
0	I don't trust Big Pharma and their rushed vaccines. We don't know the long-term effects.
0	Haven't gotten a single one. Tell me when covid is supposed to kill me
0	i dont want to put something in my body
1	I know some folks are skeptical, but the COVID vaccine has been tested like crazy and it's legit safe
1	"I lost a loved one to COVID-19. Getting vaccinated is my way of honoring their memory and preventing further tragedy."
1	the opportunity to get vaccinated and do my part in ending the pandemic is a great feeling
1	Genuinely impressive how a vaccine made under the conditions and time constraints COVID faced is so effective.
0	Vaccines are a dangerous experiment on our bodies.
0	Unvaxed for life
0	if god wanted us to get vaccinated he woulda put it in nature smh
1	Here's to hoping it works without any major long term consequences!
1	Yes I'm glad I got the vaccine. Also, other than the 0.001% of people that had an allergic reaction anyone that regrets it is misinformed.
1	Thrilled to be among the first to receive the updated booster in our town! #GetVaccinated
1	That's just great, because we'll have more vaccine for those who want it.
0	After seeing how ill my Mum is after receiving the vax I'm passing up on having mine
0	I made the mistake of getting it (Moderna) so I could travel - in Sept of 2021. 38 year old male, never been to doctor for any disease or health related problem. Have now had chest pain for over a year, high bp, constant headaches and had to get put on beta blockers as well as getting stress test. Wish I would have listened to my instincts on this one. I hope all that got it make it through this alive. I'm glad the young lady didn't back down in the face of the smug interviewer.
0	Or recent one some told me, the vaccine is a super spreader making those that took it vulnerable. Idk I’m not taking it
1	My great auntie has just had her first dose of the vaccine! (she's 91)
0	Pureblood forever
0	Didn't know myocarditis was a good thing
0	I did not get the clot shot. The surgeon general of my state came out saying the shot is linked to blood clots and heart failure. I’m so glad I listened to my instincts and not the doctors trying to force me to take it.
1	Just got mine today! Glad I did and no side effects so far.
0	I’m good I don’t need a booster because I refused, in good judgement, to take the vaccine to begin with
1	I've had 6 covid vaccines and boosters, and I'm getting the most recent booster today. I still wear a KF94 mask in crowded indoor settings. To date, I've not had covid.
1	mRNA is the future
0	all this vaccines are experiments, they didnt even take a year to make a real vaccine, those vaccines are killing people
1	Great job, Vox! People must get vaccinated, no matter which one will be applied, do it for you, do it for the others! And be responsible for taking the second dose when the time comes.
0	I would not have the coving vaccine if my life depended on it, I have had several friends recently who were vaccinated die of stroke, cardiac, some in the 50s 60s 70s its crazy, I'm thinking in many years time, after my time, this will all be uncovered and not just a conspiracy theory, we're all being treated like fools. The evidence is out their
1	"With each shot that goes into someone's arm, we get closer to the end of this pandemic" Truer words have never been said.
0	No, it was more than just control. It was a bioweapon and eugenics. The Biden Administration didnt force the illegal Aliens to get the mRNA Clot shots. 💪💉💪💉💪💉🍦🤡🤛🤪🤕🥴 Vaccine virtue signaling posterboy Sen Slingblade Fetterman is more proof there's something wrong with those Fauci-Ouchi mRNA Clot shots.
1	Trust the science, get vaccinated, and help save lives.
0	I'm unvaxxed. In 3 years since covid hit, I still haven't caught it
1	Hmmm... would I rather take the vaccine or catch Covid? I got the new vaccine already, and yes, I do stay up to date on my vaccinations. Why are people even wondering whether they should get it or not?
1	Vaccination is not just about protecting ourselves, but also about protecting the vulnerable members of our society. Let's do it for each other
0	The immune system is finely balanced, delicate and very efficient the last thing it needs is it’s T cells etc constantly bombarded.
0	Vaccine is poison! Never works for me.
1	I just lost a cousin to it. He didn't go easily. It was a very long, painful struggle for him. He was anti vax to the end.
1	the vaccine is safe because most of my family have had both Pfizer shots and there won't be any strange health problems down the road.
1	Vaccines work. Let's trust the science and protect each other
1	I work at this hospital. In my clinic this morning we offered it to three other eligible patients. One took up the offer and has had it, the other two declined.
0	Who else got fired cause refused to get a covid-19 vaccine?
0	Already know 3 people died after the 💉. The reason was : one heart attack and 2 from cobid
0	If it was either safe or worked ,they wouldn't have to constantly say it was safe and it works. On a side note,thousands of domestic flights shut down due to all the jabbed airline staff getting new variant.....
0	Vaccines should be a personal health choice, not something that is mandated by authorities, as it infringes on individual freedom.
0	i’m unvaccinated against COVID and i honestly am so happy i never got it
1	I got my 2nd shot from Moderna. I am so glad I finally got it!
0	You're an idiot if you get the vaccine
0	Never gonna get it, never gonna get it
0	I dont believe in this vaccine, sorry…they got all their numbers mixed up, what a farce.
0	The vaccines have been proven unsafe. Not even the most ardent of brainwashed covidians are taking any more. You really need to have a d dimer test at least. You will not know if you are micro clotting but if you are it’s not good!
1	Vaccines should be mandated at least for children Covid is very serious its ruined the economy, people are dying everywhere and it's not going to go away please at least get your children vaccinated they are the most risk of this virus please make them wear mask protect your children adults do what you want if you don't want to get vaccinated fine your taking the risk of getting covid and spreading it but at least get the kids vaccinated
1	I'm a vaccinated PCT working med surge for almost 2 years and I just got my 3rd covid vaccine an hour ago at Walgreens and my flu shot on Monday,get ya shots!!
0	I've read about rare side effects like myocarditis, and that's scary. I know they're rare, but it's hard not to worry about the possibility.
0	had two Az vacc last year i was very healty run around with my grankids now migriane every day walking problems tired all the time brother had 2 Acc two major stroke his only 44 year old god help us
1	We're proud of Alixel who just got her #COVID19 vaccine! Children ages 5-11 can now get their shots! They'll receive a smaller dose of the Pfizer vaccine (administered in two doses) that has safely been given to millions of youth 12+ already.
1	I took the vaccination and even if I die because of it (however unlikely that may be) it was the right call. This shit needs to end.
1	I just got my first Pfizer shot and as I'm sitting here with a slightly sore arm (utterly normal), I am enjoying understanding what is happening in my body as I type this comment.
1	Plenty of vaccinations don't provide immunity ;only a false sense of  safety.....Most people with ACQUIRED immunity are better  at not getting the disease again.Acquired is better...smallpox campaign worked and made them seem like they were good vax developers instead of lucky...DIRTNaP seems VERY educated and strident.....1000 measles in US cases , no complications.....500,000 people in US hospitals most days AND 700 die every day from "scientific" minded MD's that make AVOIDABLE deadly errors....So we don't mind  losing 300,000 people a year  from MD mistakes  ...3 trillion a year is a salve
0	By not taking the jab, I'm 100% safe from side effects and 99% safe from covid.
1	When people are testing positive it is still three times more likely that they are unvaccinated than vaccinated. Vaccination does lessen the chance of infection but does not prevent it 80% of Americans are not properly boosted. Frankly we need biannual covid shots
0	Probably not. Got the first round of two shots. Got Covid anyway. Absolutely no way to prove the shots helped any.
0	I'm making the personal choice not to get it, I'm not anti vaxx either. Had all the necessary ones until now. But I've been told 'it hasn't been tested in your condition yet, but we have no reason to believe it isn't safe and effective'. I'm sorry but that just isn't good enough for me, not when I have two friends in a similar situation who have had life changing side effects and told me they regret it. Until a medical professional can hand on heart tell me that it's fully tested for my condition and medication I won't go near it. Until then I'll just have to accept living like a robot going about my daily jobs and being restricted from everything I enjoy if covid passports take off. Feel like I'm being forced to make the choice between freedom and enjoying my life or risking my health and a flare up of my chronic illness. Not a nice situation to be in.
1	Looking forward to getting a covid booster along with my annual flu vaccination. Reject the health benefits of modern medicine at your own peril.
1	The more vaccines available, the better we can combat diseases.
0	Unvaccinated gang
1	More antivaxxers = Less antivaxxers
1	Our best chance, aside from a good vaccine and/or effective meds, is for illness to be staggered, even within a community. That way, our hospitals can hopefully care for both the usual ER/ICU/need for beds as well as the resources needed to treat each patient with #COVID19.
0	i’m unvaccinated against COVID and i honestly am so happy i never got it
0	Let's be honest;  most doctors knew this vaccine was dangerous a couple of years ago.   Doctors need to begin speaking out.  Better late than never.
0	I would call it an "Experiment" not a vaccine.
1	A lot people going to have to get sick or their love one have die for people to begin to take this seriously
1	What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
0	I never got the vaccine because I've never gotten one for anything that school didn't require.I'm a healthy young male and I haven't even gotten Covid despite little to no protective efforts. Seriously, I went to Ukraine for a month where masks aren't enforced and I still couldn't get the damn virus.
1	People are not considering that they will possibly be losing their house because of the COVID hospital bills. They might also lose their ability to work and their career, because of long Covid syndrome. But they got their “freedom”.
1	What a rich fucking thought process, if everyone was vaccinated the world WOULD be a lot better, only an absolute fucking idiot would try and rationalize otherwise.
1	This is fantastic engineering work. Way to go, biotechnology.
1	I have COPD amongst other health issues. From the beginning my doctor was honest in the fact that if I caught COVID it would most likely be a death sentence for me. I got both my vaccinations. I got complacent about being vaccinated and stopped wearing a mask when out and about. I got COVID. I did have to be in the hospital, but I know beyond a shadow of a doubt that my being vaccinated saved my life. I got a much, much weaker case having had the vaccinations. Before my talk with the doctor I was anti vax. I'm so happy that eventually I decided my doctor was more educated than myself.
1	cant wait for the following unlimmited booster vaccines
0	One of the best life decisions I made for me and my family was NOT to take any shots of any covid vaccines regardless the great panic and great social pressure against the unvaccinated
0	Basic reproduction number for influenza 1.28, mortality rate under 1% . COVID-19 (RO) estimated at 2.2, a mortality rate of 3.4%.
1	"Just the flu" is BULLSHIT. Plus there is no such thing as JUST THE FLU. That is one of the problems with the attitude, the flu can kill you also, but we have treatments for that, COVID-19 has no vaccine. THAT is why it's a BFD. Stop comparing it to the flu we have a vaccine for.
0	Doesn't matter I'm not getting any of them, haven't gotten any of them still alive
0	You have to be mental to get these
1	we have gotten every Covid vaccine and booster and have yet to get Covid. We will continue to get them, and flu shots, as offered. It works for us, just did a long road trip after this latest vaccine and stayed healthy.
1	Grateful for my #PfizerBioNTech #CovidVaccine #booster today @OSUWexMed.
1	Family united in vaccination, relieved to safeguard each other's health.
1	My girlfriends sister is a nurse and she took the vaccine a few weeks ago and is perfectly fine
1	The fact that we have not one, but two potential vaccines that are potentially hitting the 90+% efficiency mark is some of the best medical news all year.
1	Just get vaccinated.
1	All evidence shown vaccines decreased risk of death/serious illness. So many benefited because mandates encouraged them to take the shot.
0	The officials that are even now still forcing people out of jobs and basic freedom of movement and association, rather than demand full disclosure of data before vaccine rollouts, should be in fucking jail.
0	My mother died of a stroke after her second vaccine. She’d never had a stroke before.
1	This vaccine represents a major breakthrough in medical science
1	The Epoch times? Seriously? Oh my God, you people are delusional. And Covid vaccines save millions of lives. Every fucking day.
0	Hi I'm a covid anti vaxxer would anyone like to debate?
1	It's been 2 weeks since my 2nd dose of the vaccine, which means I'm fully immune and ready to aggressively hug and kiss all my friends
1	The importantance of vaccines are “I need to do my part to protect OTHER kids AND adults from deadly disease”That’s the biggest part of this problem though, it’s not “my six year old” on the table here - it’s everyone’s six year old. I have a responsibility to understand that.If we can’t understand the above, then we don’t live in a functioning society.
0	Had a local doctor have a healthy patient die on him. This was a completely healthy patient who received the vaccine. After this 100% healthy patient received the vaccine, 4 days later. This patient died.
0	I got very loud tinnitus 5 days after pfizer second dose. Still suffering 2 months later.
1	this is the most positive video I have seen about this topic
0	I’ll still never forgive those who demonized people for not having the ‘Jab.’
0	My son’s best friend had a stroke age 31, I tried to warn him, but he simply shrugged his shoulders and got three jabs. Three months after the stroke he has finally come home. Utterly tragic.
0	Never regretted not getting that shot.
0	As a frontline medical worker who lost their job to these mandates to force “vaccines” on people, I truly appreciate any time the truth is told. I am not anti vax, I have willingly had plenty of vaccines introduced to my body. I just want people to have choice and want for big pharma to be open that things are in a trial phase and not fully proven. No one should be an unwilling lab experiment.
1	That’s like saying you’re not gonna take medicine until there’s no side effects or you’re not gonna play sports until there’s no chance of injury. Vaccines are entirely safe, but you can think what you want. Getting injected with something entirely safe that can save you is just a path you don’t wanna go down, I guess. I’ll see you in the afterlife.
0	What will they do if every parent refuses to have their child get the jab? The schools couldn’t do a thing.
1	no!!!! We won’t shut up! Don’t want to take the vaccine fine but stop spewing your anti vaxx bullshit. When you go to the hospital because of Covid and fighting for your life while suffocating from this virus make sure to not take a bed for someone else who actually cares about their life and wants to live.
1	Seeing my elderly parents live without fear after getting vaccinated has been a huge relief. It's not just a personal health choice; it's a community responsibility.
1	This is so beautiful - thank you for recognizing the female scientist who drove the revolution forward. The promise of mRNA is just beginning.
1	The issue I find is that anyone opposed to them doesn't give a damn about the amount of proof/facts/articles etc showing they're safe. If you don't agree with someone who is against them, then you're in the wrong. I have yet to come across anyone who has had their mind changed by showing them facts because I "have no credibility" and they'd rather listen to what FOX etc.
1	How you not afraid of covid but scared of the vaccine hey I’m afraid of getting shot but not afraid of standing in front of a loaded gun
1	Yeah sure. Gotta keep the people getting their boosters no matter what it takes.
0	A friend of mine had a the vaccine shot and suddenly died 3 weeks later due to HBP.
0	But... if I get covid, I'll just stay home... if a nurse gets covid and is vaccinated but is working with someone who's also vaccinated but gives it to her. How did being vaccinated help either of them?
0	I'm concerned about the push for mandatory vaccination
1	Got my 2nd booster today!! This momma trying to stay safe...
1	vaccine, safe and effective.
1	I would get the vaccine so I can hug my grandparents again.
1	If Covid-19 was actually a government conspiracy. Logic would dictate that vaccination would actually be your only form of survival.
0	They are bioweapons
1	I'll take the new seat belt please.
0	I've never been tested, not worn a mask (I refuse to go anywhere that requires one to be worn) and I will never use vaccine proof to enter anywhere and will actively boycott any business that implements them. If that means I stay at home for the rest of my life, so be it.
1	I am so happy to be considered a "young person". It was such a massive relief to get the vaccine. I got Covid back in August, and I never want to experience that again. The shot was so much easier than getting sick.
0	Mandatory vaccinations are a violation of human rights.
0	"Think, be critical, don't let yourselves be misled, please. Take care of the children!"
1	Got 1st dose Moderna. Feel very weak and have  some chills. Also light headed...
1	Covid itself messed me up 99.9% more than a vaccine ever did! I find I don't even get so much as a temperature spike when I get the Covid and Flu vaccine together. But when I got the vaccine on it's own, I was sick for 2 days then grand. But Covid I was not myself for 6-12 weeks.
1	Had both Pfizer vaccines and two boosters . Sore arm and headaches with one or two and that’s all . Never have contracted Covid .
1	Possibly people who were anti-vaccines, have probably finally done adequate research and not 45 minutes of Facebook, and now want to understand what they've been missing.  More power to them, I say we help anyone willing to respond to logical and rational scientific methods and help them get vaccinated even if it's just the logistics of finding a dose.  It's admirable for a person to change their point of view after being exposed to accurate information invalidating a previous misconception.
0	I've lost count of how many people I know that have had health issues after it, especially heart issues. My friend has 3 employees who developed heart issues soon after, all young men in their 20's and that's just within a small business of 9, so imagine what's going on across the wider community. So glad I didn't line up for it.
1	While not being vaccinated, I could meet people, but I knew that there was always a bigger risk, without the vaccine, to catch the virus and then transmit it further, getting my loved ones sick.
0	Ìt was not the Covid 19 that was the killer it was the weapon design of vaccines that killed so many people & continues to. It was not tested adequately, side effects not reported, it did not do what it said it would do, prevent Covid 19. Access deaths for U.S. was 40%, climbing
1	It’s been years since I had my 5G vaccine and I still can’t stream
0	Learn to go natural, leave pharmaceuticals behind
0	I hope the BBC will run a show featuring vaccine injured people and those who have lost loved ones. We love to hear their stories and they deserve to be heard. You can't pretend they don't exist and they are not conspiracy theorist!!
1	It’s cool because when I had my 2nd dose I didn’t feel anything it really helped my immune system good
0	Dont vaccinate!
1	These scientists who developed the vaccine are speedrunners
1	You know, I don't think I really registered how good this news was. Thanks
1	"Getting vaccinated is a crucial step towards ending the pandemic."
1	Science at its finest... Amazing achievement, which unfortunately a lot of people don't understand.
0	My best friend's husband, a healthy hockey trainer, ended up having to get a pacemaker due to unexplained heart issues after the 2nd shot. They tried doing it through the vein, but too many clots. After that, he had multiple mini-strokes. Poor guy can't remember anything. We went on vacation together. He remembers going but can't tell you anything about the week. I try to talk to them about it, but they won't hear it. He even got a booster after all of that. So sad.
1	Trust the Facts, Get the Vax
0	Yes there is, it’s called herd immunity and it’s worked for the last millennia and the human population is proof of that
0	The risk to the younger population is relatively low, and the long term effects of a brand new vaccine technology are not understood yet simply because this mrna vaccine technology has only been around for months rather than years,. It's more than "not a
1	Glad im saved
0	Shame on everyone who coerced or pressured people to take that shot.
0	I call bull shit on the covid 19 vaccine scam
0	About 4 years too late
0	It’s because they forced an ineffective vaccine on people and clearly lied while doing it. There’s a thing called credibility and public health lost it.
1	WE LOVE A FULLY VACCINATED QUEEN
1	The only side effect is positive - profound relief.
0	Me Too. Not much for ANY Meds but Vax always seemed suspicious when Natural Immunity is much stronger. I am healthy and strong. Do not need ANY Meds or Toxins in my perfect Body!
1	To play a professional sport and not be vaccinated is incredibly dumb
0	I’m good I don’t need a booster because I refused, in good judgement, to take the vaccine to begin with
0	The survival rate for COVID-19 is high, so the vaccine isn't necessary for everyone.
0	My heart said no; my head said no. I said yes to my instinct and said no to the 'vaccine'. Happy and healthy.
0	Remember it was sold to us here in the UK as "Safe and effective " .. got alot of grief at work for not taking it. Proud to be an Anti Vaxer! So sorry for all the people who felt they had no choice.
1	I got vaccinated and I feel so relieved! It's a small step towards getting back to normal.
1	Just got my second dose of the Pfizer vaccine. Slightly sore arm and tiredness for a day, but worth it for peace of mind and protection against COVID-19
0	So get fully vaccinated and still get covid. Wtf is the vaccination for again?? Like what is it supposed to do?
1	Getting vaccinated was my social responsibility to help end this pandemic.
0	I’m unvaccinated and will continue to thoroughly research and remain unvaccinated.
1	THANK YOU SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY, THANK YOU SCIENTISTS
0	Yep, I had an otherwise healthy friend die of a stroke at 62 2 weeks after a booster shot... Also had 2 friends with 20 something active health male children drop dead of early adult death syndrome... Ya, because that's always been a thing…
1	Getting vaccinated reduces risk of getting covid. Reducing risk is better than doing absolutely nothing
0	Only those who want to die early or be permanently disabled.
0	my 9 yr old niece got one jab. she now has NO IMMUNE SYSTEM. her liver is shot. she has vaccine induced AIDS. I tried to warn my family and was ostracised for it. the information was n is there for anyone who CARED ENOUGH TO DIG. buyer beware. never EVER trust your government or the medical community EVER. THIS IS A MASS GENOCIDE AGENDA. ALWAYS WAS ABIUT KILLING OR MAIMING
1	As I watched the vaccine go into my arm, I felt a wave of gratitude for this shot at a new beginning.
1	Vaxxed and loving it – protecting yourself and the community, one shot at a time.
0	Think il pass on the vaccine, thanks though
0	I'm not sure the vaccine has been tested enough in diverse populations
0	I like how all they ever talk about is how safe they are yet make no mention of the vaccines being suspended in multiple countries due to blood clots.
0	I love this community. We show how antivaxxers are some of most stupid people alive
1	I'd rather deal with a sore arm for a day than a nasty virus for weeks
1	Just got my vaccine yesterday
1	I'm very happy about this. I'll be rushing to get vaccinated as soon as possible.
1	Vaccination day felt like a celebration. We're getting closer to the end!
0	Pfizer confirmed that the experimental "vaccine" does not prevent you from catching covid, nor from passing it on.
1	Say YES to a Covid Royal Commission into pandemic and vaccine responses conducted in your Countries.
0	Easy,it won't because I'm not taking it!
1	It's starting, guys and girls. The world will now slowly become just a tad more normal again. Sure, we'll still have huge problems like climate change to tackle, but still... a tad more normal.
1	2nd dose done! Felt a bit like a superhero walking out of there.
0	No it’s NOT SAFE!
0	I won't be having it as I already had a big clot in my head. I would not suggest anyone to have an injection at all if you have had a clot.
1	Happy to have received the 1st  covid vaccine this afternoon. A really great start to 2021.
0	Poor scared, masked, and triple jabbed people
0	Every man made disease. Every poison vaccine is created to kill an entire nation’s population while keeping its wealth intact
0	I am SO glad I didn't blindly follow the propoganda and get vaccinated. No regrets whatsoever.
0	I think any pathogen can be stopped with a lethal injection... But what "they" are planning is a vaccine against a toxin, which can easily be made and will work well. If you inject snake venom you will become immune to it, and if "they" then poison the water or skies, everyone not previously poisoned will die.
0	"...so consult your doctor first".If your doctor told you the truth about the vaccine he would probably lose their licence!
1	Just got my 1st dose of the Pfizer Vaccine today! Lets all get vaccinated guys ðŸ’‰ðŸ’‰ðŸ’‰
1	Well, Im 53, received all of the vacs and boosters,never had covid nor did I develop autism or heart problems. So yeah, Im happy about it
1	I’ve had 4. Never got COVID. I didn’t have side effects. Overall very tangible impact on me.
1	Links to this "proof" by any chance? Oh, and throw in some peer reviewed studies of how vaccines cause autism and how many people have died being vaccinated please.
1	I’m so excited to see there’s hope for a vaccine soon. I’m currently at school online because covid cases have skyrocketed in my area and I’m having trouble finding any glimmer of positivity about the virus ending soon, so thank you so much.
1	My poor 6 month old just go jacked with shots including an extra/early MMR because those fuckwads have decided that they don’t want to harm their baby or something.
0	Always an amazing interview- thanks for doing all you can for all of us affected by covid infections, covid vaccine deaths & covid disabled, like myself, & millions others
1	Very happy. I'm glad I could do my part to help out society. I did it not for me, I'm depressed and messed in the head enough that I don't care about me getting sick. But I did it for my mom who just recently had a double mastectomy due to breast cancer, I did it for my frail 91 year old Grandma, I did it for the nursing home she lives in and not wanting to spread sickness to all the other residents, I did it for all the immune compromised individuals who feared for their lives. It's a nice benefit of vaccines that it helps the individual not get sick, but the point of vaccines is to help reduce the spread and severity of the sickness.
0	I made the mistake of getting it (Moderna) so I could travel - in Sept of 2021. 38 year old male, never been to doctor for any disease or health related problem. Have now had chest pain for over a year, high bp, constant headaches and had to get put on beta blockers as well as getting stress test. Wish I would have listened to my instincts on this one. I hope all that got it make it through this alive. I'm glad the young lady didn't back down in the face of the smug interviewer.
0	I’m on jab 0 and I plan to keep it that way…not pumping that trash juice in my body
1	so you never use any form of modern medicine or medical procedures then? Dont have your gums numbed to get fillings? Etc. Walk around a graveyard from the 1800s and see how many lived into their 60s and 70s, and how many children died compared to now. Why? Modern medicines and yes, big pharma. They can even prolong the lives of wilfully ignorant idiots, unfortunately.
1	Free Vaccination is the only way to free from Covid
0	personally, there is absolutely nothing wrong with not taking it everyone gets the choice whether or not they want to take it
1	At this point, claiming an efficacy rate, without mapping that efficacy rate over time, is basically a meaningless claim. You need to map efficacy over time otherwise your number doesn't really mean anything.
1	Now sir please make sure that vaccine also be made available at free of cost in our state.. #Covid19 #CovishieldVaccine #Covaxin #Telangana
1	Up to you the downside to not getting the vaccine is possible death but if you don't care then don't do it. Your body your choice just don't get others sick if you do catch it.
1	If this new vaccine-making technology can also make vaccines against diseases caused by bacteria then we can also make vaccines against antibiotic resistant bacteria as well. It would be perfect.
0	I had my first jab yesterday but I've been nauseous and weak ever since plus got a running stomach. As someone that hasn't fallen sick on a decade this sucks.
1	What was said near the end is so true. Vaccination has worked so well that we don't have a memory of how bad some of these diseases were. Keep vaccinating
1	no, it’s not fucking rushed.
0	Why don’t they just lock each person up in a sanitized room and put them on a permanent drip vaccine IV. Then no will ever get Covid ever
0	95% protection for how long? Is this one and done like childhood vaccines ? Booster shot?
1	I'm a nurse, and I've seen firsthand the devastating effects of COVID-19. I encourage everyone to get vaccinated, so we can protect ourselves and our loved ones.
0	I got both Pfizer doses. The second dose was absolute misery for 48 hours. I’m not getting sick again to avoid getting sick with a milder variant.
0	This explains what some scientists are finding in the bioweapons called a vaccine that affects your DNA.
0	I took Trump's covid vaccine, and boosted a couple of times. Lots of vaccinated people got covid anyway, so it's ineffective, and a waste of time, and not worth the side effects.
1	Let's normalize getting vaccinated. It's just another part of healthcare
1	i trust science more than i trust these religious fanatics. Getting my jab #vaccine
0	Nobody regrets not getting the jab.
0	As a physician, I want to share why I have ABSOLUTELY NO INTENTION of getting a COVID vaccine any time in the near future.
1	To be clear, I do support vaccines in general & covid vaccines specifically. The science is unequivocal.
0	Anyone who takes a dna altering vaccine us a fool.
1	This man is a hero.
1	Let's continue supporting science and saving lives.
1	A lot of folks also avoid getting the shot because they feel its side effects are just as bad as COVID. Having had COVID twice and multiple vaccinations, I'll take the vaccine side effects over the real thing any day.
1	If your son's tested positive for Covid five times that means that the vaccine works. Without the vaccine he'd likely have had symptoms at least 2 or 3 times out of 5.
1	Absolutely. Because in order to achieve antibodies naturally you are contagious for up to two weeks. With the vaccine you achieve it without placing others at risk Once again, you have a fucking GED. Stop
1	I have absolutely no idea why ANYONE would agree to be a Guinea pig for this EXPERIMENTAL GENE. THERAPY DRUG! You are the trials that big pharma has not done. Beware of the future!!!
1	I am glad that there is a new covid booster because covid is going around in my area, and I don't want our entire school to get covid again. High school is stressful enough without health anxiety
0	It looked like a normal person before Jab #1.
1	My husband and I got our Covid boosters and flu shots this past Friday. A quick walk-in visit to the pharmacy, and done. And Medicare is paying. It is so reassuring to have this protection.
0	I made the mistake of getting it
0	The Moderna vaccine costs £25 a shot. Latest info coming out of the company. "Moderna is currently testing whether giving a third booster shot might be beneficial" Course they are !
1	I wanted to set a positive example for my kids, so I made sure to get vaccinated as soon as I could
1	Really hoping for #SputnikV getting emergency authorization soon in India.  The more the merrier !
1	That’s disappointing. I got the vaccine hoping I would only have a year to live and now you’re telling me it’s not going to kill me. God damn it. /s of course
0	It’s an unapproved, experimental drug. There’s no reason for sane adults to be taking dangerous experimental drugs in the first place.
0	I did not comply. SAFE.
0	The fact that they’re trying THIS hard to convince people to get that shot should scare the hell out of all of you.
0	Does everybody understand that these covid vaccines are causing millions of deaths. It has nothing to do with the unvaccinated. I
0	My wife had heavy menstrual bleeding from the vaxx. She bled for a month and couldn’t work. Eventually she had to have iron infusions from the blood loss that caused an adverse reaction which caused extreme pain in her kidneys.
1	I'm so glad I got my vasectomy!
0	YOU HAVE AN IMMUNE SYSTEM GOD GAVE YOU TO SURVIVE. THERE WAS NO COVID VIRUS, IT WAS THE SHOTS KILLING PEOPLE. If you're a democrat, you have a mental illness, seek help.
0	Climate change, within reason. We can’t stop all oil on a dime but we need to reduce AND come up with ways to adapt. Vaccines. A lot of left shit about Covid was wrong and the vaccines weren’t as good as advertised but the people attacking them are wrong. They saved millions.
0	So basically the individuals had a better chance of survival had not they gotten the shot
1	I have COPD amongst other health issues. From the beginning my doctor was honest in the fact that if I caught COVID it would most likely be a death sentence for me. I got both my vaccinations. I got complacent about being vaccinated and stopped wearing a mask when out and about. I got COVID. I did have to be in the hospital, but I know beyond a shadow of a doubt that my being vaccinated saved my life. I got a much, much weaker case having had the vaccinations. Before my talk with the doctor I was anti vax. I'm so happy that eventually I decided my doctor was more educated than myself.
1	I been through hell and back. Give me that damn vaccine.
1	This news will annoy the anti-vaxxers
0	There is only one thing that the so called vaccines have been successful doing.  Making people billionaires out of who would never have been billionaires.
0	idiots inject the goo into their healthy bodies
0	It is beyond tragic. These people instead of being arrested. They stand by this poison and promise us more of it is coming. Then our own governments mandate it! What has happened to this world, how are they getting away with it.
0	"I am perfectly healthy. I have never been sick because I always take care of myself, wash my hands regularly, eat very well, and I have never taken that vaccine, nor would I."
0	I am so relieved I did not take it and neither did my husband or kids. I can sleep at night knowing that poison is not in us. It disgusts me that people who hang onto ignorance because they are scared it's in them can't look around at all the people speaking out. All the young people who collapsed and died is heart breaking
0	The best decision I ever made in my life was to not get that jab. Healthy and happy 3 years later, while a number of family and friends were not so lucky after getting bullied into getting it. It's anything but rare.
1	here in the U.K. we had the HIV awareness slogan ‘don’t die of ignorance’ - it seems that large parts of the US need it now
0	September 2023...and amazingly still people are not connecting the dots
1	I don't understand how people who haven't been vaccinated don't have second regrets
0	I wanted to find non bias view on whether vaccine is good for the body or not. Because of the narrator's over hyped voice, this video only made me more skeptical on vaccines.
1	Effects for my wife and me from the vaccine: None. Nada. Effects for my wife and me from knowing we're vaccinated: Joy
0	At work, everyone who got the booster was sick within a week whereas I am unvaxed and haven’t missed a day of work since this whole thing started.
1	Had a shot of covaxin worked like better..... its been 2 years no covid
1	Encountered this video and I LOVED it ! well done Vox :: new subscriber btw B).  this will indeed help people get vaccinated and stop falling for false rumors form media and news. its outrageous
0	I just had to come back to this now that we know the "vaccine hesitant" people were 100% right.
0	I wonder how much they paid you to say all this ....
1	But vaccine prevented death
1	Just got my second dose didn’t hurt at all! Which is a surprise bc the first one HURT. Going to,a friends house later and my arm is getting sore so hope I can go to school tomorrow
0	There is literally no way of knowing if these vaccines pose a risk for long term, delayed onset autoimmune problems or other problems down the road. A swine flu vaccine caused a bunch of cases of narcolepsy. It could take years for people to fully realize that something like narcolepsy was caused by a vaccine and not just excessive tiredness due to the stress of a pandemic and everything else going on in the world. I’m not saying that the mRNA vaccines will definitely cause narcolepsy, but there is historical precedence for complications that aren’t always immediately apparent and can be life long.
0	i'll never forget how people treated me when i told them to avoid the vaccine.. i was already disollusioned with the world before 2020, and what followed just confirmed my disdain. glad theres still some people out there taking it seriously and talking about it
0	I am remaining unvaxxed. At all cost that is important.
1	If you’re not convinced that there’s no relations between less vaccinated kids and a sudden rise in measles in kids then idk what will. Sad to see that people don’t believe in vaccinations.
1	I wonder what % of the unvaccinated now in hospital with Covid wish they had taken the vaccine when offered. I would think 100% of them will have had their own road to Damascus moment. Get the vaccine, its safe and effective, do not listen to the crackpots on Facebook/Youtube/HYS, they may end up killing you.
1	Vaxxed and thriving.
0	There might be a problem with the vaccines towards men health so u want to tell us that is way to control overpopulation in the world thanks God I am not part of it
1	Inject it!
0	I’d rather suffer from covid than get GBS. People survive covid every day, but being paralyzed for life is terrible.
0	I am terribly sorry to hear that.  I lost one person I know and 2 that have had heart surgeries after the vaccine.  Stay positive! Prayers.
0	It's true. I've never in my life had heart issues and two days after taking the vaccine I ended up gasping for air as i collapsed on the floor holding my chest that had a heart about to beat right out of it. It was one of the scariest experiences of my life, I called the ambulance. I might make a video on my experience too.
0	I'd rather take my chances with the actual disease than risk vaccine side effects!
0	Unvaxed and kicked covid in 3 days a couple years ago. Recently, my whole workplace got covid some weeks ago and some of them still came in to work, i didn’t even catch covid then. I love my immune system
0	This is not a vaccine. Just a weapon.
0	This guy may have been paid to advertise the Covid vaccine. Practically, most of my dozen family members have suffered and continue to suffer painful health conditions following the injection.
1	Encourage your friends and loved ones to get #vaccinated against #COVID19. The vaccine protects you from severe illnesses caused by coronavirus. The vaccine is safe and available nationwide for all recommended populations. #Chanjwa! Pata Chanjo, #TuweChonjo
1	It didn’t have to be this way. Mitigation techniques plus vaccines work.
0	Just going to point out after re-analyzing the Pfizer Covid-19 Vaccine they found out that it causes: death, cancer, cardiac events, and various autoimmune disorders, hematological disorders, reproductive, and neurological disorders.
0	With no clinical trials to prove efficacy.
0	Anyone else having bowel and kidney issues? I'm unvaxxed, so I suspect shedding or another vector of poisoning .
1	I'm vaccinated, at least I won't feel guilty in public places because you haven’t been vaccinated
0	Pure bloods be proud. The jabbed are dropping like flies. Stay strong a big fight is coming
0	If scientists are so confident that their vaccines are safe, why is there no liability
0	I've seen reports of vaccine injuries. No way I'm taking that risk.
1	Vaxxed vibes only. It's a small jab for a big shield against sickness.
0	I got the vaccine and never got Covid. There you go! I win!!
0	Yep ,and despite compulsary mask wearing and vaccine passports, scotland still has the highest rate of infections. If the science and the evidence is to be followed then it is clear that vaccines only stop hospitalisation and that masks seriously do not work. Stop the diktat and do not comply
0	"For not getting vaccinated: They told us we were selfish, insulted us, kicked us out of the gym, and we lost our leisure and travel opportunities... And in many cases, our jobs. They took away our freedom, but now our health is intact."
1	I’m 18 and fully vaccinated, because I work as a COVID tester. I didn’t feel ill after the second vaccination personally and I am so happy and relieved that I can visit my grandma more safely. That’s what I’ve been most scared of, passing on the disease.
0	I’ve had both shots and I feel so sick chest pains and feel literally like I’m dying it’s a year later now 😢 I’m scared the fphizer really gave me clots this is scary
0	I think every man, woman and child should protest and stand up against tyranny. I know many people that has suffered badly after the shot, ICU badly!! And nobody is talking?? Is the public so gullible? A sad state of affairs indeed.
1	Absolutely amazing. I'm of the opinion that vaccines are the most important scientific advancement we've ever achieved, even more so than antibiotics. #VaccinesWork
0	The world is forever indebted to you and all the other scientists involved in the development of these life saving vaccines
0	Unvaccinated and proud.
0	The vaccine gives you a permanent and irreversible heart condition like a boss

1	Just take it. JUST DO IT! #Nike
1	Great after taking the booster
1	Why don't we just let people who don't want to get vaccinated die to covid?
0	Vaccination is a racket of poisoning for profit under the guise of disease prevention
1	Well you know what they say “Prevention is better than Curing
0	I’m antivax and I’ve been doing research since the beginning of the vaccine rollout
1	Anti-vaxxers: VACCINES ARE BAD Measles: yea I agree Polio: yea same Smallpox: he was my neighbor and he violated me
1	Grateful and proud to get my first of two COVID-19 vaccine doses so I can minimise the risk to the patients
0	My in-laws take the shots because they’re normies and fall for everything the news tells them. Their cognitive abilities have degraded considerably. I feel sorry for them.
0	My daughter was diagnosed with POTS as a result of having Covid, not the vaccine.  But she also fainted in the shower the night she got the meningitis vaccine that is required for college, so I’ve wondered if there’s a connection there of some sort
1	I have had both vaccines thank you to the scientists
1	Sign me the fuck up.
1	It’s important that we get as many people vaccinated that can, so we can protect those unable to due to health issues or potential reactions.
0	110 000 side effects only in Sweden!! ( in 1 year) 12000 serious and still counting …
0	Useful fr mankind
0	I would never take that vaccine. I've planned to avoid the vaccine at all costs; you never know what it might do...
1	Vaccines are a gift from God. They have improved life for people around the world. Glad that you were vaccinated, sorry that you are being hassled for it.
0	There are too many unknowns about the vaccine. I'll stick to proven methods.
0	So relieved that I didn’t crumble, I remained strong and do not have that poison in my body !!
0	Would like to know how effective it is
1	Vaccination is our strongest defense against COVID-19. Let's protect ourselves and others by getting vaccinated. 💉🌍
0	What will this vaccine really do to us ????
0	New Jersey mandates vaccines in 2008. In 2010, autism went up 40%. During the Wakefield scare, parents stopped vaccinating. Autism diagnosis dropped.   The military have the highest vaccination rate. Their autism rates are the highest 1/40, along with 30% infertility. Don’t forget gulf war syndrome which was caused by vaccine.
0	Sheep to the slaughter. I’ll stay pureblooded.
0	Kudos to all the uninjected!
1	What a privilege to have received the #PfizerBioNTech #vaccine @StGeorgesTrust this morning!
1	No your a selfish twat you might be 29 with a good immune system but have you thought about the older & the vulnerable who have a weak immune system, the ones you could easily pass it onto because it's all about me me me
1	hopefully people will choose to get vaccinated instead of refusing them. coming from a family where my parents, relatives, and even grandparent are doctors, working during this pandemic is exhausting and it can't go on forever. i hope people realise that any step of prevention is important compared to no prevention at all.
1	I wonder how many motorcyclist wish they wore a helmet after a wreck. It's likely they didn't afterwards because they are dead, but if they could think for some final moments I bet they wish they were wearing one.Death seems so arbitrary and just a thing that won't happen until it does.
0	The answer is no. You don’t need to get so extra focusing on micro details you’re skeptical about yet you still cant fathom the idea that these shots are just bs pushed out for money
0	Sending Love to All those that have been vaccine injured. I decided not to have it from the beginning but it makes me so angry and sad that people who were trying to do the 'right' thing, were constantly lied to, throughout the whole world. World leaders have all had the same narrative and are still banging on about it being 'safe and effective'. Meanwhile, I have lost six friends much younger than me pass away in the last ten months and many more with strokes, heart problems and cancer. It is sickening. Changing data and lying to the public and making people who are injured feel like they are imagining, lying etc. and these wonderful people are pushed aside. It makes my blood boil. God bless you all and I pray everyday for your full recovery
1	Getting my booster today, so that’s good.
1	Vaccine injuries or deaths are almost always due to an allergic reaction to an ingredient in said vaccine. I say almost because there are *very* rare cases in which something just doesn’t go right with the vaccine, but again, that’s very rare. Personally, I’ve had both vaccines, and I’ve had the booster last Thursday. Each time, the only thing I had to deal with, was the usual side effects that they tell you about. Nothing more. I’m perfectly fine, perfectly healthy, and surprise, I haven’t had COVID since I got it a year ago, **when I was unvaccinated.**  CDC says there have been over five million confirmed deaths from COVID-19.  Five million, versus seventeen thousand, on a planet with 7.9 billion people. It’s not hard to see that the number of deaths from the vaccine do not even compare to the amount of deaths from COVID-19, and certainly not to the amount of people on this Earth. The tiniest of margins, easily outshone by a much larger one.  Chew on that.
0	We have testing and vaccines for flu and yet it kills tens of thousands of Americans EVERY SINGLE YEAR STOP THE COVID-19 HYPE!!! Sickening and sleazy!!! COVID-19 = Y2K hysteria. Outrageous!!
0	I have got a serious chronic kidney disease which is an autoimmune disease. ..and all of it started after forst dose.
1	The data overwhelmingly supports the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines. Trust in science and get vaccinated to help us return to a sense of normalcy.
0	My heart breaks for all the people who felt pressure to take the jab.
1	My husband and kids also have COVID. Thankfully everyone has mild symptoms so far. This is our first infection and I am grateful we were able to avoid it until my younger child got both vaccines.
0	THANK GOD I DID NOT GET THE VACCINE
1	This is the reason I cried tears of joy when I got vaccinated. Knowing people in countries would do anything to have the opportunity to be vaccinated. It is a privilege and blessing to be vaccinated and I was so, so happy when my turn finally came!
1	"The benefits of vaccination far outweigh the risks."
1	And somehow 5 BILLION vaccinated people in the world are still walking about. Hmmm
1	Healthcare worker, COVID-19 pandemic impacted healthcare, vaccinated to help protect patients and colleagues.
1	"Then the COVID-19 vaccine is effective, right?"
1	Actually the purpose of vaccines is to "boost" the body's own immune defense. Thusly promoting natural immunity. (this article is silly)
0	Had very loud tinnitus ever since AZ Vac dose 1, had no other Vac after that. I had no signs of tinnitus before the Vac.
0	I still ain’t getting it. I believe in God not a vaccine that no one knows the risk in side effects etc in the future.
0	is developing afib... associated with the vaccine. Interestingly.. I developed this less than 2 weeks after my second dose.. and I have had 4 episodes...since then...one about 5 months after the booster. I am on meds now...and have not had another episode...nor booster

1	I'm scheduled to get my latest shot this Sat.
1	Congrats, alot of people are afraid to take it due to lack of research on it but you are brave enough to take it. Respect
1	Thank you for explaining this to normal person, I’m more understand of efficiency of vaccines now
1	I’m sure this will get blown out of proportion by the anti vax community, but the reality is that vaccines have risks too. They’re just substantially lower risks than the risks of a Covid infection
0	Ohh yay , new COVID vaccines!!!! I was wondering when we'd get our 28th one.
1	They weren't designed to stop transmission They condition an immune response thus lowering risk of severe symptoms That they only achieve that for some, for a short time frame, and that variants further reduce efficacy is where we actually are Avoid infection as best u can

I am healthy individual, My immune system is very strong I am not overweight and I am not in the categories described that are at risk. Therefore I do not feel the need to inject some thing in my body that may or may not make me sick or may protect me. My body my choice motherfuckers

0	I’ll pass on the covid boosters
1	I’m currently on day 5 of quarantine. My symptoms were very covid like so i am refraining from all human contact even tho my oral swab test came back negative yesterday. I am staying with my mother and she is helping with my kids as I sit in her guest room and she drops food at the door like a prison guard. When one is available, I will be taking myself and my two children to the nearest vaccination site with rolled up sleeves.

1	Yesterday, I got my second #Moderna shot. Before and after the shot all I could think of was the "We Can Do It!"
0	AstraZenika is literally in the high court right now being labeled as defective. And people wonder why there is distrust.
0	you all honesty think the jab is safe and it's there to help us 😂 wake up now. the government is corrupted and are liars
0	I also have a strong science background, and I was able to see quite clearly that no doctor or scientist had any way of knowing whether these vaccines were safe. So when Public Health claimed the vaccines were "safe and effective" I knew right away they were either lying, confused, or working as a marketing team.
1	You'd rather have brain damage than brain damage?  One of the ways vaccines cause autism, is literally because the measles virus in the vaccine attacks the gut and the brain, and it's obvious that measles inside your blood, muscles, organs, and lymphatic system, is worse than measles that's in your gut, lungs, or mouth, where it can get out through the mucus, urine, feces, vomit.  I'd rather take my chances through the gut, ingested, than through the arm objected.  Okay, I'll be more likely to feel shitty, and get sick, but I'll be less likely to bypass the gut and lungs and go straight to getting severe permanent damage.  Wild ingested measles will likely cause me to get sick and be unwell for a week give or take, and will, if gotten past my defense systems like my gut, my blood brain barrier, my mucus, and my cillia, occasionally cause a permanent damage.  Laboratorial injected measles will occasionally cause me to get sick and be unwell for a week give or take, and will, be more likely to cause permanent damage.
0	I AM UNVACCINATED AND ITS GONNA STAY THAT WAY
1	Shot number one is complete. Don't be duped by the mass hysteria based upon FALSE information. Vaccines are safe and they save lives.
0	It’s because he’s vaxxed and boosted that he’s had it three times.  It’s called immune imprinting, and unfortunately, it will continue.
1	33 years old. I'm scheduled to get my first dose on Monday. I'm doing my part.
1	It's really, really important for pregnant women to get vaccinated against covid.
0	This guy in a nut case, never ever should have got this job !
0	This happened to me! I got my first dose and a few weeks later I was hospitalized and my platelets were VERY low and my red blood cells were EXTREMELY high. The doctor said I wasn’t supposed to be alive. I had the Pfizer vaccine. I regret I ever got that shot.
1	Yeah, evidence it’s safe. Like that will convince anti-vaxxers
1	At this point I want the vaccine I’m just scared
1	Anti vaccine kids: dies from sickness Anti vaccine mom: those dang video games
0	I never got vaccinated, neither did my brother. We both only Caught covid once . It was like a prolonged cold.
0	i’m unvaccinated against COVID and i honestly am so happy i never got it
1	You know being an anti-vacc is gods plan    I mean it's a way for idiots to not have offsprings
0	I personally know 4 people who now have Parkinson's Disease, because of this Poisson.
1	I'm impatiently looking forwards to my second shot, but not going back to society sounds good tho.
0	It blows my mind how many people actually took the jab. It was so obvious what was going on...
1	Maybe spend less on arms and more on vaccines?
0	I'm not convinced vaccines are the answer
0	Those who are 'ever vaccinated' (had every vaccine - 6,7 or 8) in the UK for coronavirus 'Covid-19' are the most likely to die. Those never vaccinated for the same - are dying in way less numbers.
0	"It's ok to have questions about the vaccine"...as long as you come to the RIGHT answer.
0	Happy to have survived the pandemic, and the vax mandate without sacrificing my mental faculties nor my purebloodedness.
0	I know 2 healthy people who suffered very serious life threatening kidney issues after the vaccine. One who is partially paralyzed. One 35 year old healthy young man who died with his head on his kitchen table. Two who were put on Remdesvir that only had mild symptoms and then on a ventilator who died and another one who survived the ventilator and now has serious health issues. There were so many more who were literally in bed for a week unable to take care of themselves after the vaccine. Most of the other people I know got the vaccine and had multiple rounds of Covid that were worse than those who never got the vaccine. That's not a way to encourage people to either go get another booster or even get one at all.
0	I never regretted not getting it. Thank God I didn’t give in to the pressure.
1	Today is the day! Feel very lucky to be in the first wave, when it’s your turn PLEASE receive your #CovidVaccine #PfizerBioNTech
0	Our daughter in law who is still young took the vaccine now has developed blood clots. This vaccine is meant to depopulate our society.
0	No jabby-jabby for me! Praise GOD!
1	Vaccine's giving me hope of hugging my friends again soon.
0	It turns your cell's into a spike protein factory. The spike is a bioweapon
1	That statement applies more to yourself than it does anyone else here.  We do understand vaccines through hundreds of years of science. Those of us who actually work with the vaccines and/or disease that vaccines protect us from understand the inserts, understand the risk behind REAL vaccine reactions, and understand the consequences of not vaccinating.   It’s your average person who doesn’t have the knowledge to read a vaccine insert and know the exact science behind that list of ingredients and how these compounds interact with our bodies, or the genetic predisposition that increase the likely hood of those scary reactions listed in the insert. Those are the people that get told to read inserts and then panic because they don’t understand what they’re reading.
0	Natural selection will take care of the virus. We don't need a rushed vaccine. #LetItRunItsCourse
0	No thanks I will wait for my herd immunity
1	She was most likely already required - at a bare minimum - to get Hep B, flu, MMR, Td/Tdap, varicella, and meningitis vaccines to work in her healthcare job, yet she's taking a stand at getting one more vaccine? Give me a f'ing break. Pure attention seeking behavior! Exhibit A: interviewing with CNN. The only small consolation is that she's not a nurse, physician's assistant, or doctor. Good riddance to this halfwit. 👋🏻
1	Very brave women who deserves all are respects for not giving into fear and taking the vaccine and a huge step in bringing the pandemic to an end.
0	I've respected all COVID rules for one year now. But I am not at all comfortable with this Vaccine Passport. I've told a few friends last week this is what it would come to. They said no way, that's Nazi Germany crap. Yes, it is. What we choose to do or not do with our health and bodies is our own business. Showing someone proof of vaccination on a phone app seems creepy.
1	"I'm immunocompromised, so getting vaccinated was a no-brainer for my own safety."
0	The question is not whether "it works," but if it's safe and necessary.
0	Better get my 48th booster!
0	Please take it off the market
1	We always knew/suspected this. But the ones that do the fearmongering around vaccines will not be interested in facts…
1	but on a genuine note you're a fucking idiot if you refuse to get your vaccine i do not care
1	i bet bill gates is happy he can monitor the movements of this 90 year old woman.  oh wait, I'm not clinically retarded, of course I don't think that.
1	Honored to be part of the solution by getting my COVID-19 vaccine. Together, we can defeat this virus!
1	I'll never stop thinking that my life might be very different now if I had only been able to convince my aunt to get the vaccine. I miss her everyday.
0	Would never get the vaccine..90ish survival rate, do you really need it..no thanks
0	I have my doubts. There's so much conflicting info, unlike the clarity we have with childhood vaccines.
0	I'm glad I trust my gut feeling, the pharma industry is absolutely evil. I have companies still denying me just because I'm unvaccinated, its crazy
0	Oh my gosh, I never got the jab and I’m perfectly fine!
1	requiring masks (rightfully) is like saying everyone should drive on the right side of the road unless in pass with care zones while you are passing.
1	I got the vaccine and so did my boyfriend, mom, dad, and grandpa. We have not been sick. No major side effects from the vaccine. I recommend everyone get vaccinated. I had friends that died at 25 years old from the virus and they were healthy. It was hard losing them and i dont want anyone to go through that loss.
1	Vaccinated individuals are less likely to experience long-term health consequences from infections.
1	Yes ! Science rules! Science has all the answers! Nothing else matters!
0	I've had this symptom since taking clobazam for seizures. Get dizzy and vision goes black when I stand up. Got so much worse after covid vax, it also made me have seizures after 5 years without any
0	This documentary sickened me to my core. And further convinced me that I would never take it. Well done to Nazarin for standing up for herself.
0	Don't get the jab!
1	save live
1	Young person who got their vaccine here! I was lucky that a lot of the barriers got removed for me. I am studying to become a teacher so I was in an earlier group and the second we were eligible a class mate sent out a link to the vaccination site at my campus.
0	You're hilarious if you think I'm taking even 1 single vaccine
1	I had COVID about a month ago. It was super mild for me. But I’m double vaxed and boosted.
0	More vaccines, yay! We can totally believe the claims this time, totally.
0	I was forced to get my vaccines by my mum because I was under 18. I never wanted ir, because I knew it was a terrible idea, and I'm blessed to of had zero effects, but seeing what's happened to others, I am terrified now. I wish I was like you all who never touched it.
0	my mother is in her 60s but she acquired a fibrillation since her second round of shots
0	Its the vaccine that has killed already over 30.000 people in Europe alone!! False propaganda
1	I'm not an idiot so I took it as soon as I could get it.
1	You can’t board a plane in EU unless you show proof of vaccination. They require a QR code with what most call a COVID Passport This has made traveling feel a lot more safe than I thought it would. Also testing is free and easy to access in most places. USA should follow suit.
0	I did not get the clot shot. The surgeon general of my state came out saying the shot is linked to blood clots and heart failure. I’m so glad I listened to my instincts and not the doctors trying to force me to take it.
1	I believe in science and am pro-vax.
0	More than 80% of people in my  country didn't get vaccinated. I am happy about that.
0	I don't care if I look like the wise guy or the dumb guy I it's my decision I just decided I'm not going to do it I'm a guinea pig if that's the case yeah
1	The kid getting covid without the vaccine is far worse than if they get it after the vaccine. All the side effects of getting covid are worse than the known side effects of the vaccine. My kid got his as soon as he could (it ended up being 6.5 months) and his booster at 8.5 months. He's getting his bivalent booster in a week.  Definitely get all the vaccines on the vaccine schedule, including the covid one.
1	And the vast majority of deaths were from those who were NOT vaccinated.
1	it is likely the booster will last much longer. It is a good idea.
1	300,000 dead under trump from Covid, 600,000 dead under Biden with a WORKING VACCINE. You don’t need to worship Biden in order to get him to have sex with your kid. He’ll do it anyway, so you can stop publicly blowing him.
0	They need u to use covid vax as artificial immunity and shut down your natural immunity
1	Honestly, getting the COVID vaccine was a breeze. It's great knowing that science has our backs, and we're on our way to beating this pandemic.
0	Never took the covid vaccine and no plans on it never ever going to take it ever
0	Obviously works for pharma
0	I'm really glad to see how many people won't take this demonic junk!!!
0	. . . i love my natural immunity! and it doesn't cause unexplained myocarditis !!!
0	don't you guys think it is possible that, to some people, the vaccine is a greater threat than the virus?I don't live in the US but, to me, the vaccine is objectively a greater threat than the virus.Not because the vaccine is a huge risk or anything, but because the virus is such an insanely low risk. I live in a small town that has had 5 cases since the pandemic began, 4 of which were people passing through, I work outdoors, all my hobbies are outdoor hobbies, I am young, and I am very fit.For my personal circumstances, the vac is just unnecessary and I don't trust the government/pharma corporations to have taken people with similar circumstances to mine into account with their global/national scale cost benefit analyses.If I was fat/old/lived in a city, I would probably get the vac.But people still tell me I am dumb or mentally ill for not getting it.Obviously, I'm not sure that people that have similar circumstances to mine would make up the 18 percent mentioned in this article, but I think it is definitely possible that it could be 10% or even 15 percent at a stretch.I think people should just admit that the pro-vac corporate propaganda is mainly targeted towards people that live in cities
0	vaxxers are willingly participating in a grand experiment without knowing the risks?
0	These streamers promoting this poison are getting paid well to push it.
0	No way. I would eat healthy and exercise and trust my immune system. If the government cared about our health they would have stopped drugs, alcohol and cigarettes.
1	Got the jab and hit the gym next day, no side effects, just more reps, vaxxed and pumped.
1	You know who is breathing normally? The Vice President of the United States, Kamala Harris, and our POTUS, Joseph Biden. Both still upright and above ground. It's a good day to be vaccinated and alive, don't you think?
0	Doesn't matter I'm not getting any of them, haven't gotten any of them still alive
0	I assume you haven’t read ingredients to the flu shot... the ingredients alone are enough for me to never get it (I do have other reasons as well).
1	Vaccines are universally accepted by medical professionals as vital to maintaining our health. Go back to the times before vaccines and see the kind of crap we had plaguing our populations due to life threatening infections.  This disease is ridiculously infectious and more lethal than your typical winter viruses and is evidenced to have a number of long term effects on a portion of people who get it and recover. Why wouldn't you want to protect yourself?
1	I've never regretted getting any synthetic mRNA injections, and every day I'm more relieved that I did.
1	I got COVID in the Spring of 2020. I had heart palpitations and breathing problems. The vaccine actually helped me feel better.
0	peer reviewed study: mRNA COVID-19 Vaccines Caused More Deaths Than Saved:
1	these vaccines are safe, anything otherwise is utterly ludicrous.
0	You are statistically more likely to get Covid and to be hospitalized if vaccinated. Look at a statistic not from biased USA companies
1	Encouraging everyone eligible to get vaccinated
1	I've had my first shot, my arm hurt a little the next day, it was nothing
1	We got the Covid vaccine as soon as it was approved for under 5 (she was 9m). It was Pfizer so she had 3 doses with the last one being delayed a week so that she could get her 12m vaccines first (the nurse handling the Covid vaccines recommended that). A week later us parents were hit with Covid while our LO was completely fine! No symptoms at all which I definitely think is due to the vaccine-we didn’t mask or quarantine away from her because we were all exposed together while on vacation and we don’t have anyone else to watch her.
1	Very excellent public service announcement. I hope that lady made it. I hope more people follow the science and get vaccinated. My Dad and I are fully vaxxed. We care for everyone and want to protect them so we also wear our masks…sometimes being the only ones doing it.
1	We need vaccinations against stupidity.
0	From fit and active to trapped in my own home, abandoned by the NHS, gaslighted by my GP, this is my 3 year vaccine helI journey
0	I'm glad I trust my gut feeling, the pharma industry is absolutely evil. I have companies still denying me just because I'm unvaccinated, its crazy
1	There’s finally light at the end of this long, devastating tunnel
1	I had 1st shot of Pfizer yesterday morning, no severe sad effects, just felt hungry and about 30 minutes light headache in the afternoon. I have been on diet. Yesterday I had to eat three good meals, with carb, red meat, vegetables, fruits, nuts, fish now I feel normal.
1	Some people have had very very bad reactions to the vaccine but I’m still getting it
0	No jab for me; I've seen too many adverse reactions.
0	Put toxins in your body to "protect" you from something with a 99.95% survival rate... Sound logic
1	It would be easier to manage the pandemic if everyone was vaccinated.
1	Sure, He was wrong.  The virus evolved rapidly.  The vaccine still protected almost everyone who got it from death.
1	Feeling hopeful for the first time in months. Vaccines are the way forward
1	They should bump the unvaccinated in favor of treating vaccinated people who need help. “Oh you decided to start trusting medical science now? Tough shit”.
1	So many conspiracy theorists. I don’t understand why people think someone made up Covid, killed thousands of people around the world and ruined economies, all in the name of putting a tracker in them, when most of them are carrying mobile phones that track their whole lives anyway. Grow up and get vaccinated
0	Yet none of my zombie friends/family will ever see any of this. Not even if I sent them this video. They are committed to being good sheeples. They would never even watch this.
1	Getting vaccinated not only protects us but also supports the overall public health efforts to curb the spread of the virus
1	BIG FACTS! Don’t care which vaccine it is we just need to help stop the hospitalization and deaths
0	Once more, my wife and I were saved by our nurse-related senses tingling, telling us to avoid the vaccine at all costs.
0	I got my first shot 10 days ago and I have been very Ill. Went to hospital 3 days ago, was diagnosed with covid.
1	Just got the Johnson and Johnson and everyone is telling me I should’ve waited for another. But I know it doesn’t matter.Edit: As of May 6 I am fully vaccinated, if you read this please don’t reply or give any attention to anti vaxxers. Have a good day everyone :)
0	There's so much conflicting information out there. Hard to decide
0	I have never heard of ANYONE getting myocarditis from COVID. I've heard of plenty of people including older people developing it from the jab.
0	Still not getting it
0	4 booster shots later, so much for flattening the curve…
0	I became an anti vaxer  when the biden administration started forcing it on us
0	Over half of the employees at NIH won't even take the jab!
1	I’m definetely not an antivaxxer. Vaccines are the biggest advancement in medical history.
1	I've had all the vaccines and have been super cautious about attending mostly outdoor gatherings and events and wearing a mask in crowded settings (was one of the few on my last cross country flight).
1	Oh, I personally think the covid vaccines(most of them at least) are very useful, and am very excited by mRNA tech in general. I haven’t personally seen any compelling research that shows significant danger for any of the recent vaccines baring what you would expect from an induced immune reaction. If covid becomes endemic and predominantly upper respiratory than I don’t see any reason why it shouldn’t be vaccinated the same way we do flu vaccines, on request and only mandatory for healthcare workers/those that are immunocompromised. I am still a bit wary of COVID-19’s neurological effects though.
1	Vaccines aren't just shots; they're shields against illness. Time to armor up, folks.
1	Got my vaccine shot today and I feel Great!!
0	RISHI SUNAK SAID COVID19 VACCINES ARE SAFE. YET THEY CAUSE AUTISM IN RATS.
0	By not taking the jab, I'm 100% safe from side effects and 99% safe from covid.
0	Covid-19 wasn't the bioweapon. The vaccine is. Covid-19 was just psych-ops portion of the war …
0	Covid vaccines were never safe and never effective, not in any way shape or form.
1	One was my dad. I have full faith on vaccines.
0	100% safe from side effects, 99.98% safe from COVID death. I think I’ll stay unvaccinated. Let’s Go Brandon!
0	My friend died from a heart attack in Thailand in his sleep & he had taken the shot. When I got infected I waited months to get the shot & when I did I started to feel different.
0	This is probly the only time we see when a vaccine fails more doses of it are recommended
0	4 out 5 of my brothers have gotten it, all of them vaccinated.  My one brother has gotten it twice.  My sister-in-law triple vexed has gotten it.  Here I am unvaccinated and have never gotten covid and they still think I’m the crazy one.
1	Wow, so glad I got vaxxed!!
0	Can't wait for vaccine to be available for my granddaughter who will turn 2 in October...
0	Never regretted not getting that shot.
1	Vaccination is an act of community care and responsibility.
0	Just watched a video on this, and I'm freaking stupid scared of what I heard and saw, not everyone would have the same symptoms BUT I don't think it's any good
1	I usually tell people that it’s safer than birth control. 1 in 1000 women experience severe complications from birth control, and we hand that stuff out like candy.
1	Vaccinated and feeling empowered. We can do this
0	Yes, all medical interventio s can have some side effects, but the Covid vaccines have adverse reactions which are off the scale. But they are still aproved!!!
1	What is an oxymoron you may ask?  The science of anti vaccination
0	NO THEY DO NOT. VACCINES DO NOT PREVENT INFECTION OR LONG COVID. MASK UP AND DON’T GET SARS-2.
1	Young person's proactive approach, vaccinated to safeguard health despite age.
1	Losing a loved one to COVID was the hardest thing I've ever faced. Getting vaccinated felt like I was honoring their memory.
1	I wasn't doubting the vaccine
0	Not a single one of us regrets not getting the jab…NOT ONE.
1	Me: I’m not so sure about all this stuff…but I really don’t want Covid. Reluctantly gets vaccinated Video: “immortal human cells.” Me: PUT EM IN ME NOW!!!
0	Considering they changed the definition of a vaccine to say it works, and skipped all of the long term testing for approval. I’ll pass. Somethings up.
0	It is illegal to injection an unknown substance into humans. If adjuvant not revealed violation of informed consent. Disgusting
1	So sick of ppl not getting vaxed like are you for real
1	Vaccines will work with your immunw system. So it'll be ready to fight with the virus
0	Vaccines are just a way for the government to control our minds. Wake up!
1	COVID was (and to a degree, continues to be) a very difficult time. But the scale of the tragedy averted is absolutely mind boggling.
1	To the “more people die of flu” c blowing this all off, the reason so few die of flu is because there’s a f***ing vaccine. If there weren’t a vaccine flu would be a pandemic. There is NO VACCINE FOR #COVID19 &; won’t be for a least a year. Hence, the dire warnings. #EndRant
1	"I am from Mexico. Today, I got vaccinated on June 14, 2021, and for now, everything is fine, as if nothing happened."
1	Edward Hale is fortunate. That’s because he understands how science and facts work.
0	The only thing to know is that I will never take this poison.
0	By not taking the shots I am 100% safe from adverse reactions and 99.98% safe from Covid
0	Or ‘how can we avoid getting the vacine ?’
1	god i wish we have your vaccine, people here literally wait for weeks just to get sign up
1	Even if it is still in vaccines, the fact that it's in there still doesn't make vaccines dangerous.  Take natrium, a metal that basically explodes upon contact with water, and chloride, which is very toxic. Together those two make the everyday salt you sprinkle on your food. Two highly dangerous elements get entirely different properties when together.   The same goes for the mercury maybe still used in vaccines. It's properties are changed by the other elements in the molecule it's used in.  I don't know if mercury is still used in vaccines, because I'm far from up to date on the subject, but basic middle school science is enough to understand this argument.
1	Two things never get old, dark humor and unvaccinated kids....
0	Why would someone want to listen to doctors who drink, smoke, eat fast food and don’t exercise?
0	I NEVER took the jab. I was pressured by my own family, criticized, and bullied but i stood my ground. MY BODY MY CHOICE RIGHT?
1	I work in an ER. I’m vaccinated, boosted and mask when appropriate. Never had Covid. At the same time, I take care of you antivax chuds who typically ask for the vaccine just before we intubate them. Too late then.
0	I weep for my friends and family that took the you know what.
0	Unless they release all possible side effects and the percentage I can’t take this serious. Even if it’s .001% still release all data
1	Initially hesitant, but research and doctor's advice affirmed vaccination.
0	At this point, I feel like Big Pharma just wants to sell more vaccine. It's all about the money.
0	My family has seen 2 deaths from heart attacks 1 member now dealing with a heart problem and 1 who has cancer since taking the vax!
1	My sister who works with children got covid.  I think it started in her eye, because she never has swollen eyes. She's fully vaccinated too. Although the vaccine cannot prevent you from getting covid it is said that it won't spread all the way into your lungs. I know my mom was against the vaccine, but more recently she was considering getting vaccinated.
0	The original vaccines were very effective at preventing getting OG wild type covid, from transmitting it as widely, or dying from it. Covid mutated away from OG WT very quickly, the vaccines were not as good a match for Delta and Omicron. Vax still brings down COVID deaths.
0	No one should take these shots
0	It's all about money. Vaccines are a cash grab for Big Pharma.
0	sounds like some bs i had no shots and got covid  was sick for one day. no need for a shot
1	Had 5 shots, caught COVID once. Bedridden for 2 days, but it was mild compared to some unvaxxed friends who were hospitalized.
1	It is a free shot...just take the damn thing!
1	Got my shot! Doing my bit for the herd immunity thing.
1	I unfortunately got covid after I was triple vaxxed. I'm still convinced that the vax prevented a much harsher outcome from the infection.
1	god i hate fever dreams. vaccine fever dreams better than covid ones though
1	I am fully vaccinated and I feel great. I don’t have any reactions. Now I feel I am more confident to be outside in the public and not be afraid anymore.
1	Got it and have no regrets. All ready booked the next booster
1	Get your vaccine because it will keep you from getting really sick!
0	I am unvaccinated and don't have any regrets.
1	I got the Janssen/Johnson and Johnson vaccine. My husband got the Pfizer vaccine. Thanks for making this video for the world.
0	Thank god I still never got a flu shot or vaccine for COVID and never will
1	COVID vaccination is a lifesaver! It's our best shot at ending the pandemic and getting back to normalcy. Protect yourself and others – get vaccinated!
1	COVID-19 vaccines does not interact with human DNA inside cells, and does not enter the cell nucleus where DNA is housed.
0	If you aren't a conspiracy theorist, the side effects will turn you into one.
1	I got vaccinated for rubeola when i was a baby, yet I got rubeola when i was 14 years old. Neither my family nor I blamed "the vacc didn't work", it's just my immune was bad at that time. Still doesn't change my mind about getting vacc, a jab it is.
1	Hey Dr Mike I just had my first Covid vaccine jab two days ago so thanks You for educating me with your videos and I hope you have a great day
0	Crimes against humanity. Lock them all up.
1	It's because the medical establishment lied. There was a time when you took the peer reviewed studies at face value. Those days are gone.
0	us anti-vaxxers are fine, unlike you jabbed up junkies
0	Injecting this poison left me with bad back pain.
1	Deaths from COVID reduced by 85% once this most vulnerable population was vaccinated
0	Never regretted not getting that shot.
0	Someone still falling for the covid vaccines lol?
1	Unfortunately, vaccines working or not doesn't mean anything to the anti-vaxxers. Saving your child's life is practically irrelevant, as long as they don't get autism.
1	Last week I finally lost my COVID virginity. My symptoms were mild, and I was shocked when the test result came back positive. But I got the booster last October, so I stayed home from work, blew my nose a lot, and got paid while I watched football and movies. My thanks go to science and paid sick time.
0	I'm glad I trust my gut feeling, the pharma industry is absolutely evil. I have companies still denying me just because I'm unvaccinated, its crazy
0	Oh, the vaccines, that caused my neighbor to have convulsive episodes and shakes.
0	95% of people in hospital are vaxxed ! So what do you all say about that!? Am sorry for this man horrible situation but do you’re research and then come at me!
1	Choosing vaccination as a responsible act, recognizing the role it plays in reducing the spread and impact of the virus.
0	I'm never taking these vaccines. I know that COVID is potent and really dangerous for many, but these vaccines are even worse. Many experts in the field now have nightmares about what's to come for those who thought the shot was the solution
0	Say HeII No to the Fake VAX!!!!
1	To have 3 promising vaccines is amazing. This is wonderful news.
0	I refused to take the shots. I thought the way in which they kept pushing it was highly suspect. I kept getting phone calls from my GP and text messages asking why I hadn't taken it. I was never an anti-vaxxer, up until this drama unfolded. Now I wouldn't take one ever again
0	All of the anti-vaxxers out there I've got one message for all of you I salute you keep up the good work
0	I never got vaccinated, I got Covid 3 times. I had chronic asthma and my Doctor told me if I didn’t get vaccinated I was going to die. I have never felt so great in my 40 years of chronic asthma till now, I have not used my inhaler for the last 11 months. I trust God and I knew that I didn’t need to get vaccinated or probably won’t be here to tell my blessings.
0	She also ignored the fact that people who are vaccinated don't get nearly as sick if/when they do get COVID. I would have almost certainly had serious complications if I'd not been vaccinated prior to the (only) time I contracted COVID. I still get my boosters even if they make me sick because I'd rather take the day or two of being Ill from the vaccine to weeks of illness or long COVID complications.
1	If you think Morrison is coming to save you, think again. Your best bet to safeguard your family is through vaccination and masks. If you’re hesitant or uncomfortable out somewhere and not comfortable how Covid-19 risk management mitigation is being implemented. Don’t go there.
0	These people are mentally ill. Worst case scenario you have Covid. So what? It’s a cold! People wonder how Hitler was able to pull the wool over so many eyes….sheeple.
1	I just reported it on the VAERS site.   The more concerning thing for me was that I was feeling just fine after the initial two days afterwards, and THEN these mysterious side effects showed up after a few days of feeling totally normal.    I am going to be out of town the next couple of weeks, but will def contact my doc when I return if still experiencing these side effects.   Still 100% glad I got the vaccine.    Nothing I can't handle, assuming it doesn't get any worse!!
1	so exciting that you got the vaccine! I get my second dose on the 26th of this month and I can't wait to have it done!
1	Embracing the COVID-19 vaccine is like casting a vote for the health of our society.
0	What you need to know is, say no to shots
0	Hello! I am not super eduated on this topic as I've not taken a biology course in years, however, I am concered about any long-term effects the vaccine can have especially because unlike other vaccines, this vaccine has not had years of research to determine any possible long term effects.
1	I used to be a Covid denier back in March of 2020, and thought it was some lame new strain of flu. It wasn't until one of my idols (Rick May) and relatives died of it that I started to realize this is serious. I'm so ashamed that it took people I looked up to dying to take this seriously. It's my biggest regret in life, I wish people would just listen instead of trying to be so self-righteous. Please everyone, stay safe, and like a good life.
1	Great video I’ll be sending to my grandma to try to convince her to get one!
0	Yea but I don’t trust it, there’s always things like mercury or the radioactive toys kids used to play with and then 20 years later or whatever, they come out and say “we said this stuff is harmless because we thought so but now we found it it’s terrible for you”. Now anything they tell us is harmless I am wise enough to not trust it. Fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shake on me.
0	Moderna gave me confirmed myocarditis and irregular heartbeat, and then I had a heart attack after a late night hockey game.. 33 years old.
0	If you took vaccine against measles (gwirikwit), polio, whopping cough what makes Covid scarier?. Vaccines saves life
0	Her decision is her right and choice! She should not be discriminated against the lines of being not vaccinated! Even those who are vaccinated can get Corona and spread it. Who said vaccination is the key to a healthy life???
0	My Son refused the vaccine from the very beginning. He watched Dr John and I must admit this man has spoken co.men sense all along. We are now paying for all these jabs. My Son feels ha did the right thing and so do I.
1	I just got my first vaccine today. No side effects so far. Thank you to all the scientists and researchers around the world for making the vaccine available this early and thank you for this channel for spreading the science. Yes, it’s definitely OK to be smart. Science rules!!!!
0	No jabs. Caught covid twice in a 2 year span. Had head colds worse than covid. I will never be jabbed with anything...ever. My immune system given to me by God Himself is sufficient
0	Pure blood here, keep the faith No vaxxers
1	My understanding is that even if someone gets a mild disease after vaccination they produce less viable virus and have shorter duration illness, both of which mitigate spread as well.
1	I got my 2 jabs already
0	Too many have died from it
0	But Fuck you American citizens who have been suffering from serious #vaccineinjuries not just physically but lost YEARS of income from our debilitating #VaccineAdverseEffects The government we PAY FOR has more important things to worry about like the MILLIONS of #ILLEGALimmigrants who need OUR tax dollars to help them afford to live in OUR country 🤬🤬🤬
0	Am not a skeptic, am not hesitant, not an anti vaxxer either. Am an intelligent free thinking, free breathing adult who has researched the dangers of an experimental dangerous UNNECESSARY drug and decided I dont want to die.
0	Go get your fourth shot and 10th booster
1	I got the first vaccine today. I'm a bit fatigued and sore in my arm and have a slight headache.
0	I know so many people (all of whom are fully jabbed) who have got a constant cough or headaches or are feeling generally unwell.
0	How COVID-19 Vaccines Are Tweaking Our Immunity and causing numerous illnesses and deaths - This should be the headline
1	m masking even when im vaccinated and as everyone should
1	Glad I got my booster but it caused my leg to twitch which was super weird
0	I had covid early.  However I knew I had the antibodies and never took the juice.  I bounced back and am healthier than Ive ever been.
0	Tell me again why we, “can’t get back to normal” until there’s a vaccine ??
1	Proudly sporting my "Fully Vaccinated" sticker! Let's encourage others to do the same.
1	This would never have happened if everyone got vaccinated
1	The people who think that going All natural is a good thing forget about the most important natural thing. Natural selection.
1	The vaccine itself is effective, the biggest problem is that political propaganda makes people resist
1	As a person who caught long Covid and has been having heart issues for three months (at 29) now hearing how dismissive anti vaxxers are makes me so sick
1	So grateful to receive my 1st Pfizer covid vaccine today.
1	I took off two days for my second dose too. Hoping I won’t have the side effects but better safe than sorry
1	Every new year party host should require a negative covid test and a proof of vaccination at the door.
0	Hasn’t Pfizer been fined billions and billions of $$ for falsifying data on their products?
0	500 fully vaccinated -  wearing masks -- huge arena -- What's the point of the vaccine if it doesn't protect you in an arena that houses 20,000 and you're one of 500 people in it. OVER THE TOP!   When does it end?
0	There is a chip in the vaccine.
1	There is no such thing as a Pandemic without side effects'
0	Good start. Not enough. Moderna killed my grandfather and this took place 3 months after I was disabled by an antibiotic at 31 years old. Three generations of restitution and reparations for my family, and prosecuting these eugenicist animals
1	Stay safe, everyone. Remember to wash your hands, cover your coughs & sneezes, and be courteous to others.
1	Vaccines are a beacon of hope. Let's embrace them for a healthier future.
1	Curious too how folks who still back this thing in the medical community promote it when it's well established it does not prevent spread, a primary and defining function of vaccines. Or have you adapted your thinking and let that part go to catch up with the data?
0	He’s wrong. Covid19 has death rate of 0.2% and the flu 0.7%. There’s also no vaccine to the people that died from the flu and the average death of covid19 is 81yrs old - that part.
0	My 69 year old sister who is vaccinated and boosted got Covid and is having a hard time. I got Covid on 8-10 of this year. Not Vaccinated and did very well. I have psoriasis and Fibromyalgia. She has 0 health issues. I’m 61. Just an observation here.
0	Yeshua is coming   i dare yall again get that mark of the b3ast vaccine   go to Jesus  he is mu vaccine   never vaxed  never will  and healthier then ever!!!
1	I'm vaccinated, and I feel it's my duty as a responsible citizen.
0	Studying vaccine development prior to the COVID outbreak gave me all the information I needed to refuse the new vaccines.  Best decision I ever made
1	Waiting for that vaccine
1	I can't really understand why someone would want to get sick rather than just getting the vaccine.  Vaccine gives you a sore arm and a bit of fatigue for a day.  Covid can put you in the hospital, even if you're "young and healthy" without any "pre-existing conditions" etcetc. It's not likely, but the effects of covid are, across the board, worse than the side effects of the vaccine.  The only conclusion that I can reasonably come to seems to be that it's just a fear of the/a vaccine.
0	Wait until they find out how unsafe Covid actually is.
0	I’ll never trust the government again after the whole covid fiasco. Imagine forcing everyone to take an under studied, dangerous vaccine or else you lose your job
0	Sadly idiocy cant be cured
1	I'm vaccinated, by my own choice. I think it's the smart choice. But should it be enforced? Absolutely not. Even asking the question as if it is legitimate is an affront to the most basic principles of freedom.
1	Antivaxxers are a plague
1	Cried with relief that an RSV vaccine is approved! It's no joke. Staying in a crowded ICU with a brand new newborn is awful. But now that doesn't have to happen! 🙌
1	Stick me anywhere however many times you need to if it means I can go to a concert again
1	I don't get it there alot of people in here saying well the survival rate is 99.5 for this vaccine is bs. Let me tell you something for the elderly this virus have been a death sentence
0	Dear fellow purebloods. Stay strong
1	I wonder how many of the people that “I ain’t wanna put nun chemicals in my body” how many of them eat fast food, drink soda, smoke cigarettes, get their nails done, hair dyed, eat pre packaged food etc etc etc.
0	Let’s not forget that her majesty the Queen was victim of it 💉💉💉
0	They never once tell you the benefit
1	The efficacy rates of Johnson influences the hospitalisation rates of other vaccines..
0	I refused to take the shots. I thought the way in which they kept pushing it was highly suspect. I kept getting phone calls from my GP and text messages asking why I hadn't taken it.  I was never an anti-vaxxer, up until this drama unfolded. Now I wouldn'
0	Definitely noticed changes in personality of those who took multiple jabs
1	pros of the vaccine - you don't die of covid  cons of the vaccine -
1	Um, we could listen to the people who have spent their lives working in healthcare.....I'm retired from healthcare, and I absolutely loved my job, and I learned all I could about it, to be helpful to others. 99.9% of the people I worked with felt the same way. Some have made Americans believe a lot of nonsense, and I think we know where it originates. Vote wisely, and you'll see less and less of the 'alternative reality'....
0	I don't believe that the vaccine will work for a longer period
0	Ivermectin: Effective and Safe!
0	Everyone who pushed this poison must pay, even yters.
0	If this vaccine doesn't give me super powers I'm not taking it
0	By not taking the jab, I'm 100% safe from side effects and 99% safe from covid.
1	people who are against vaccines baffle me- my sister wasn't vaccinated and she got whooping cough when she wa
1	The antivax cult is still around and loud. It’s exhausting but we keep fighting the good fight.
1	My grandmother who is 85 tested positive for covid 19 and she never experienced any symptoms, she is still alive and doing well.
0	When they push something that hard, and that fast.... Beware
0	I have implored everyone I know to avoid any experimental arm-pricks under any circumstances. The number of adverse events is just too high. And it doesn't prevent infection nor transmission.
1	Hopefully I never have to have another booster again. I am not in anyway an anti vax person but the COVID vaccines just freak me out. 2 people in my family, my grandma and my brother, developed an embolism in the lung after their COVID vaccines. My grandma now is suffering from pneumonia that won't go away and half of my brothers lung died off and he's 28. Both had Astra Zenica and both have been offered "compensation" from our government.
1	Got my shot. It's a small thing, but feels significant.
1	Fully vaccinated and it feels soooo good 🎶💪🏼 We are extremely lucky and privileged to have access to Covid-19 vaccines in the U.S. right now.
0	Never take their poison.
1	Almost there... We finally have a path to no more deaths, return to work and more importantly our normal lives…
1	Again and again we see these antivaxxer horse's a$$e$ or sadly their families regret their decisions
0	It was proven when the first person got covid after getting the vaccine. You covid cultists are the weirdest bunch of humans.
1	Distribute that shit right now!
0	Studying vaccine development prior to the COVID outbreak gave me all the information I needed to refuse the new vaccines.  Best decision I ever made
1	It’s important to get a booster shot to stay healthy
1	we lost our uncle to covid. he was such a loving man but he was afraid of getting vaccinated, like most of our family. After his death, my parents started to take it seriously enough to consider getting the vaccine.
0	The second #Moderna shot side effects just kicked in 24 hours later.
0	I'm holding off until there's more consensus among experts
0	I regret it, looking back how we all kinda just gave in. We should’ve asked questions. The vaccine was made too quick in my opinion without any long term testing.
0	I DONT WANT THIS EXPERIMENTAL COCKTAIL OF MAN MADE CHEMS!
1	I’m a public school teacher, I am 100% going to be taking a vaccine as soon as possible to make sure I don’t spread anything unintentionally to my students or colleagues. When we have the tools to stop suffering, we need to use them.
1	You ever think that government wants you to get vaccines is because they themselves don’t want to live in a quarantine zone?
0	Never let them jab you or your kids,
1	I am an athlete. I got my second dose of the covid vaccine 3 days ago
1	Just got my first pfizer vaccine today. Just have a sore arm. My poor grandma didn't want the vaccine and she passed away from covid-19. Please get the vaccine guys
1	I've never made a better decision in my life by protecting my family from this virus.
1	I was hesitant and I got it, I don’t regret it and feel a huge relief.
0	I'm so grateful I did not inject that junk in me! :)
0	They are different but in terms of how they are experienced they are quite similar. And there is flu vaccine but no #COVID19 vaccine. Tens of thousands die from the flu every single year. Did we ever stop the world? Lack of vaccine = only difference in how people experience this.
1	We need this video translated to other languages. There are people who fear the vaccine because they don't know what it is and how it works
1	I’m glad I got it, never understood the resistance. Data is solid on it, mRNA has been in develop for ages.
0	nope I ain't getting it not even if they held a gun to me
1	You don't do the right thing by vaccinating you get consequences to save lives! Poor you being forced to consider others instead of yourselves! Stay home then!
0	This is the first time in history where people are more scared of the vaccine than the actual virus...
0	My best friend's husband, a healthy hockey trainer, ended up having to get a pacemaker due to unexplained heart issues after the 2nd shot. They tried doing it through the vein, but too many clots. After that, he had multiple mini-strokes. Poor guy can't remember anything. We went on vacation together. He remembers going but can't tell you anything about the week. I try to talk to them about it, but they won't hear it. He even got a booster after all of that. So sad.
1	I’m distraught by the emphasis on vaccination as key to Covid survivability without an acknowledgment of the *millions of children* under 5 who don’t even have an option, combined with no timeline for when they will, nor an interim plan to protect them until a vax is ready.
1	Well I got the shot and on my 4th booster. It's been 2 years now. Exactly when am I going to start getting sick from the poison shots? This is pretty weak poison.
1	I vaccinated mine against COVID as soon as it was available. No side effects, super happy baby, and is still an absolute delight.
1	Note what he said at the beginning and the end: we were able to get to finished vaccine because of all the research into other coronavira over more than a decade. They did not start from scratch!
0	My friend, who is 39, fit and healthy, was hospitalized with stroke-like symptoms yesterday. He received his second vaccine dose 3-4 weeks ago, his wife said he woke up in the morning and complained of his heart racing and difficulty breathing.
1	I will continue to get boosters as they become available.  I think that the Covid vaccine will continue to be modified as new variants arise.     Down the road, I envision an annual Flu/Covid vaccination
0	Studying vaccine development prior to the COVID outbreak gave me all the information I needed to refuse the new vaccines. Best decision I ever made
1	i trust the medical pros on this topic
0	Vaccines also have risks
0	Does it really make the workplace safer? Vax and unvax can both contract and transmit so this whole thing is not logical.
1	My friend has diabetes and got the J&J and it’s booster and he had no problem. So for most people this vaccine is good. Talk to your doctor for which one you should take if you have underlying health conditions. Stay safe everyone!
0	Let's be honest;  most doctors knew this vaccine was dangerous a couple of years ago.   Doctors need to begin speaking out.  Better late than never.
0	The vaxx causes the compromised immune system. Yes, covering their tracks for those who were misled and succumbed to the pressure to take the experimental gene therapy.
1	I’m really glad to hear that the vaccine for Coronavirus is getting rolled out.
1	Getting vaccinated is a responsible choice for the health of the community.
1	it's free and can save your life, seems like a no brainer.
1	The more people get vaccinated, the faster we can open up our economies.
0	I consider not getting a COVID vaccination one of the healthiest decisions I've made, right up there with quitting smoking cigarettes.
1	I'm all for safety, but damn, we need those vaccines now. Wish there was a voluntary system where people who wanted to take the vaccine could.
1	It’s sad but I’m now 100% sure humans never invent a time machine cause there is no doubt that out of all the things to go back and fix this COVID shit would be it #vaccination
1	I’m beginning to understand how vaccine can prevent Covid virus! I was just assumed that this is the same thing with other vaccines… That’s super Matter of fact, i thought if we got an injection, we would get it done. What’s frustrating is we would keep going through theses situation. Sounds to me like we have to live together with these infectious diseases. I’m jittery about my future️️
1	That's scary. I was called a Lab Mouse among my coworkers for getting vaccinated as soon as I could get shots (I live in Russia). And I persuaded my parents, niblings and friends to get vaccinated as well. I am glad I did - my antivaxx coworkers changed their mind only after contacting the virus. My neighbours died from virus. I lost my son back in 2019 and I don't want to lose more people I held dear.
0	As a nursing student,  in clinical I had a patient with platelet count of 8 after recieving the vaccine. I never knew platelets can be that low. She was ok though.
1	It's as simple as doing whatever is in our power to do what's best for the community. Is that not enough?
0	ngl I think you all are going to turn into zombies. I'm glad I don't have foreign code writing scripts in my body
1	Vaccines provide protection not only for the vaccinated but also for those who cannot be immunized.
0	The pressure to get vaccinated feels like an infringement on personal freedom.
0	I don't really feel like I need it. It's my choice and I just decided not to get it
1	Vaccination is a key part of the solution to the COVID-19 pandemic. Let's come together as a global community and applaud the progress made in developing and distributing these life-saving vaccines.
1	I'm grateful that my eligible family members are all fully vaccinated. Education in my family is like religion in most families.
0	Im an avid fan of health and medicine innovation except flu vaccine
1	I've got my first does of covishield along with our 2000+ troops at our base, 10 days ago. And doing fine. 👍 It's absolutely safe.
1	I'm a senior who tested positive for COVID fourteen days after getting the newest vaccine (so I was obviously exposed earlier). But I felt completely better after 5 days. I'm definitely very glad I got the shot. Thank you for this article.
0	So Harris if the Biden administration says to take it I politely say I won’t!!! Trump 2024 USA USA USA !!!
0	For a vaccine that they claim safe, effective and well studied they shore keep on coming up with a lot new aftereffects
0	My mother died 20 days after her vaccination - 24 hours after vax - she got thrombocytopenia and died a horrific death. Never will forgive for what happened.
1	One of my employees believed the Bible was his vax.  Maybe it was at because he survived Covid, but spent 11 weeks in the hospital, 7 of them ventilated, and 3 months later still needs supplemental oxygen. Stats say vax would have reduced the chance of what happened to him.
0	I did not get the clot shot. The surgeon general of my state came out saying the shot is linked to blood clots and heart failure. I’m so glad I listened to my instincts and not the doctors trying to force me to take it.
0	Biden's anger at the unvaccinated made me decide not to get the Jab.
0	I'm not anti-science, but I'm skeptical of the rushed vaccine development process.
1	Thank god I live in a country where there are almost 0 anti vaxxers.
1	To the people scared of needles, I got my last vaccination a while ago! Neither of them hurt, you can feel a pinch and after that you can’t even notice the needle is in your arm! My arm hurt and I had a slight headache about a day or two after, but it’s definitely not nearly as bad as Covid!
0	Being no longer a preventive drug, but a maintenance rather, like Vitamins does, on what legal grounds did you enforce this on Humanity? What on earth did you do? You will go into prison for this crime woman.
0	May I see the science that proves there safe? The FDA document says long term studies won’t be done till 2025.
0	When they tried to tell people the jab would prevent them from getting Covid. There has NEVER been a cure for respiratory infections. Then how they handled it and how they’ve always labeled Covid vs how they’ve sold it; completely contradictory
1	All of my coworkers are saying they are going to refuse this vaccine. They also thought that China was going to invade the US if Biden won the election. My coworkers are uneducated idiots.
1	All these vaccines protects you well.
1	Anti-vax is a political decision not a medical decision. I’ve been a nurse for 43 years and have yet to hear one good science-based argument against vaccines in general. An individual may have allergies or immune issues for one vaccine but that doesn’t preclude all (plus someone with those issues and was on active duty would be exempt anyway).
1	I just got my first Pfizer shot and as I'm sitting here with a slightly sore arm (utterly normal), I am enjoying understanding what is happening in my body as I type this comment.
1	Scrumptious? It’s a life saving vaccine, not a fucking cookie.
1	Well, I got it as soon as I could. April 15 literally just happened and in California that's the date everyone can get it. I didn't qualify to get it any earlier and there are a lot of people in California.  Edit: I forgot to add yeah I just got my first shot April 16th. I have a phobia of needles too. I braved it because I want to be done with this. I've been inside and sad and unable to see anyone or do anything. I want to keep people safe and I want to feel that sweet sweet freedom.
0	4 shots and counting plus “boosters”? Within a year!? Nothing to be skeptical about that.
1	First shot complete with minimal side effects. Vaccination is the key to ending the pandemic. Let's all get vaccinated for a safer future.
1	Pfizer is the best!!!
1	Got my first dose of vaccine yesterday (as soon as I could get it where I live) despite having a phobia of needles. Yes it's possible, yes you feel like a idiot because you panicked for nothing, just get over it.
0	Cha-ching !!!! Hope that PHARMA $$ helps you sleep well at night
1	Brazilian partner to China's Sinovac Biotech said that the COVID-19 vaccine is effective against the UK and SA variants, citing the test results in the Chinese Trial.
1	The booster is over $200 I can't afford it. Make it free and i'll take it again
0	Let's be honest;  most doctors knew this vaccine was dangerous a couple of years ago.   Doctors need to begin speaking out.  Better late than never.
0	Remember it was sold to us here in the UK as "Safe and effective " .. got alot of grief at work for not taking it. Proud to be an Anti Vaxer!
1	"I received the AstraZeneca vaccine. The first dose gave me dizziness, nausea, and arm pain. The second dose only caused arm pain. I am doing very well, thanks to God."
0	That vaccine is meant to hurt the American people. Many people I have known have developed blood clots.
0	Anti vaccers are not stupid it's all about the choice. You can believe the doctor but you are still a free person and you should be able to choose.
0	I just wanna know how many vaccinated people still ended up getting covid... because wouldn't that defeat the purpose of getting the vaccine in the first place?
0	Someone who was perfectly healthy then had 3 heart attacks and other symptoms . It is perfectly reasonable to assume it might be a vaccine injury.
1	Glad I was fortunate enough to get the Super Vaccine of the vaccines. #Moderna
0	I'm hesitant about the COVID-19 vaccine due to the speed of its development. Normally, vaccines take years to develop, and I worry that we may not fully understand the long-term effects yet.
1	I’m the opposite! my dad passed away from covid and we all got vaccinated. It’s scary and sometimes we don’t know what to do or who to trust, but if a vaccine can help you so be it. I
1	I'm so grateful for vaccines. And so glad that new techniques are making them more effective and faster to make!
1	Get your booster, y’all. Unless you enjoy getting sick.
0	Im unvaccinated and alive. The best part of it is not getting myocarditis.
0	Glad I said no to the jab and stood my ground despite the challenges from friends and families. I don't trust the system, period.
1	Vaccinated and proud to be contributing to herd immunity!
0	This page worships big pharma and tyrannical gov policies, fantasizing that either care about your health or safety, while attempting to shame other people's religion.
1	Same I only caught it in April this year it levelled me for 4 days can only imagine how terrible without vaccine or boosters. Anti Vaxxers are weird simple people.
0	Not in a hurry to get vaccinated. Let's see some more data.
1	The vaccination, which is a less severe version of Covid 19, allows your body to generate antibodies against it, so I'm fairly sure you'll be able to fight off the illness if you ever come into touch with someone who has it.
0	My kids are in their 30's. Didn't give them certain vax because we knew about how it gave children autism. Glad everyone is catching up. But sad that it took this to do it, sad it took so long, sad it ruined so many lives because others called us crazy.
0	I only got the initial shot, but given all that's coming out now I'm glad I didn't get any boosters
0	I have family and friend passed away days and weeks after. I am 66.  No vaccuies or pills. No flu shots full of Virus.  I feel good.   Thank you God.
1	Smart people get vaccinated.
1	Vaccination is a powerful tool against COVID-19. I got my shots for the safety of my family and community.
1	The scary thing is I hear “I’m not worried about getting it I have good health”. Well what about your elderly mother or your pregnant sister or your newborn nephew. People are so unbelievably selfish
1	While I am not an anti-vaxxer, I do believe the Pfizer vaccine had direct correlation/cause to the development of my heart inflammation. I am a young, healthy person with no known underlying conditions, exercise regularly (never run), and have never even "felt my organs before in my life" until. After the 2nd Pfizer vaccine, I got sudden heart palpitations - myocarditis, within about 2 weeks. Today is about 9-10 months post 2nd vaccine, and whenever I get stressed, my upper left quadrant "acts up."
1	Got my jab. Doing my part to end this pandemic!
1	Life always come with risks as a side effect. But the chances to getting side effects compared to getting into ICU due to a coronavirus infection is pretty minuscule.
1	Delta almost killed me. If I hadn't been vaccinated I know I wouldn't be here.
0	I certainly won’t be getting a second dose or any of the boosters. I’m not willing to be an experiment.
1	Those who are hesitant about the vaccine are only hesitant because of one of two reasons: 1) They haven't taken the time to read, research, and understand about the vaccine, or 2) They are reading lies.
1	Vaccines save millions of lives each year and a COVID-19 vaccine could save yours.
1	I am fully vaccinated as of yesterday.  I received Pfizer's vaccine and experienced no side effects from it.   For the sake of your country, community, friends, and loved ones, please get vaccinated when it is your turn.
0	That's why I'm a proud Pureblood.
1	The only way this pandemic ends is by inoculation.
0	17 vaxxed brainless idiots downvoted this video!
1	You can prevent post COVID-19 condition by taking measures to prevent the infection: get vaccinated and stay up to date with booster doses
1	As a teacher, getting my vaccine meant I could protect my students. It's not just a job; it's a responsibility I take to heart.
0	I have heard that spike proteins from any version of the vaccines do not remain in the muscle tissue as they are supposed to and cause severe damage throughout the rest of the body.
1	I'd rather have a headache and be achey than pass off covid to my parents.
1	The virus has caused various different long term health conditions for all demographics. This is exactly why the vaccine was/is so important. It reduced the amount of people contracting the virus and reducing the amount of people with long term effects.
0	keep that vaccine away from me!!!
0	I am unvaccinated and don't have any regrets.
0	My family has seen 2 deaths from heart attacks 1 member now dealing with a heart problem and 1 who has cancer since taking the vax!
0	I won’t take a Covid Vaccine no matter who tells me to.
0	There was no way I was ever gonna get that vaccine. Glad I didn’t.
1	A vaccine is the world's best hope of overcoming the covid-19 pandemic
0	Someone still falling for the covid vaccines lol?
0	It is illegal to injection an unknown substance into humans. If adjuvant not revealed violation of informed consent. Disgusting.
1	This reminded me of my mom's reaction to people who won't get it- "more for me!"
1	A soccer mom telling a pediatrician that he's wrong. Confidence: 9000
1	My grandmother got the shot
0	Sometimes you just can feel where something is not right and that most definitely includes this Vaccine
0	This guy must be given his "shots" one after the other and left to SEEEEE and may he suffers dearly!!!!  These people needs to be held RESPONSIBLE!!!!!!
1	1st dose felt nothing, 2nd dose sick and unwell for 1 week. Lets just hope COVID 19 pendemic ends soon
0	Natural immunity IS KING!!!
1	Being concerned of the risks of the vaccine is acceptable but dismissing all evidence of past vaccines being effective is pure ignorance and stupidity.
0	I don't want the vaccine because I'm scared it will change my dna in a way that I can't see or feel but will be detrimental somehow to my children and all future generations for that matter.
1	The vaccine conversation should never been had between politicians in the first place.
1	I am pro vaccination and would happily get the #covid19 vaccine, but cannot as not in the 3 priority groups...so does that mean that I should not be allowed to travel out of Australia??? Qantas is way out of line here
0	i’m gonna take it because I’ve never had a blood clot and I want one
1	I heard someone say they wouldn't get vaccinated because they didn't want 'a third arm.' I responded, "I'll have a third arm if it means I can be around people again."
1	I love vaccines and the things they have done for humanity. My only concern is the synthetic lipid layer that holds the RNA in this new type of vaccine, which if I'm correct never existed in other vaccines? If you have any info on it, please reply below, it would make me less worried to know more
0	I got my second dose of the covid vaccine 3 days ago. The next day after the vaccine, I couldn't sleep. I had the worst fever ever.
0	I'm 53. Canadian. Unvaxxed. Had covid. It was a nothing burger.
0	More vaccines, yay!  We can totally believe the claims this time, totally.
0	Someone still falling for the covid vaccines lol?
0	Here’s me shook that comments are available. DONT LET THEM JAB YOU
0	When will the vaccine be approved and actually distributed? The wait is killing me
1	Second dose #AstraZeneca done! Fully #vaccinated #COVID19Vic #CovidVaccine #VaccinesWork #Melbourne #Jabbed
1	It’s mind boggling that so many medical professionals refuse to get vaccinated. If anyone should know better it’s them.
0	All of the anti-vaxxers out there I've got one message for all of you I salute you keep up the good work
1	reduction to 4% of not being vaccinated. Not 4% of the total population. So if your chances of unvaccinated death is 1%, then after vaccination your chance is .04%. In other words it goes from about 1/100 to 1/2500.
0	A friend of mine had severe joint pain after vaccination.
0	Was I the only person that pondered the fact that it was absolutely impossible to know the long term effects from this shot. Looking back, thank God I quit my job and found one that didn't mandate it.
0	I am so sorry that you were tricked into getting the jab. There are a lot of things on the internet that people are posting on how to detox your body and get rid of the negative things that they put into those shots. I will also be praying for you
1	Herd immunity through vaccination can protect those who are unable to get vaccinated.
1	Three shots in, feeling invincible against COVID!  #FullyVaccinated
0	Thanks for the video! I find it too much of a coincidence that MRNA techlonogy has "matured" enough pricesly when we are told we need it. I seems that is just the excuse they are using.
0	lmao I can't believe so many people get their vaxxes like good little sheep then come on here wishing us death. good day to them
1	The COVID vaccines are incredibly effective. Go get it.
0	The lack of long-term data on the COVID-19 vaccines makes me cautious. It's difficult to trust a vaccine when its long-term impacts on health are still unknown.
0	Vicious propaganda. I had two family members from from the covid vaccine and others seriously ill. Don't be stupid. Don't fall for evil tricks like this.
0	I cannot trust a vaccine produced this quick. So many steps skipped and we don’t know if long-term side effects are a thing.
1	Choosing to get vaccinated is an act of solidarity with those who are vulnerable and at higher risk. It's a small sacrifice that can make a huge difference in the battle against COVID-19
0	I am skeptical about the motivations behind the push for widespread COVID-19 vaccination.
0	How are long term side effects prevented in a vaccine that has been tested for such short time?
1	Just got second Moderna, feel like I've got the flu for the last 24 hours or so. But better than Covid.
0	The vaccine has been poisoned by politics that leached into the science. Two of my grand kids going to college were forced to take the jab in order to stay in college. I now know of other young kids who have developed heart problems from the vaccine. I'm a vet and if anything happens to my grand-kids from the phony vaccine, I will not be happy. You made the right call and may have saved you life and many others by setting the example. This choice should be a choice of the individual, not vaccine money grabbers.
1	Mom’s getting their recommended COVID vaccination prevents respiratory distress in their newborn babies - GOOD CHOICE MAMAS!
0	I am scared that the vaccine is not going to do my body well. I think that it will give me some problems.
0	"I prefer to rely on my body's ability to build immunity naturally rather than through vaccines."
0	No regrets here! Healthy and happy and completely unvaxed!!
1	Agreed, all of this anti-vaccine stuff is getting ridiculous.
0	Safe and effective... so why some people died after the vaccination
1	Vaccines aren't miracles. They are the products of research, curiosity, and the hard work of scientists.
0	Vaccine had side effects in UK
1	Long term vaccine reactions are very rare. If you read people’s “experiences” on Reddit, you will think these are common, but they are not. Don’t look for answers here. Look at statistical data. Anti-vax posts have a political agenda.

0	Hello! I am not super eduated on this topic as I've not taken a biology course in years, however, I am concered about any long-term effects the vaccine can have especially because unlike other vaccines, this vaccine has not had years of research to determine any possible long term effects.
1	Had both my shots back in may, my 81 year old mother too… we are doing just fine
0	I trust my gut more than any doctor. My family hate me because I refused to take the jab. They all have been sick after taking the experiment and all I do is pray for them to recove
0	There's not enough transparency about the potential risks of vaccines.
0	Good morning Dr. Campbell. Thank you for such a professional and easy to understand predation. I have had many friends and family members die unexpectedly including my own mother. I didn't vaccinated and very thankful to God and you. God bless
0	At least 23 die after receiving COVID-19 vaccine in Norway.
0	When my husband got deathly sick from covid, I begged a doctor to give him ivermectin, but all I got was a lecture from him. MY HUSBAND DIED and now I am a widow. My husband was turned away from our hospital 3 times with no effective treatment except for oxygen and he was told not to take aspirin, only Tylenol. Aspirin might have helped, but they told him not to take it. So now I am a widow with no legal recourse at all and then the hospital had the gall to ask me for donation after they killed my husband.
0	Are the gullible public still falling for this bs this is unbelievable
0	Can you show us now how did they engineered the virus, how did they insert the cleavaged furin site patented by Moderna to make it more infectious?
1	I had mine two days ago in the UK and I was achy and could hardly stay awake the next day. Happy to have it tho
0	No Thankyou im fine. It's madness untested badly regulated back handers flying everywhere and people think itll be the answer to their prayers. 99% recovery rate already naturally using the immune system you were born with. Its all about the profis to come. Theyll be c20 c21 c22 c23 c24 and boosters for those that want them.
0	There has never been a successful vacination against a virus.
1	Vaccines are extremely good  for the treatment of disease
1	Make sure you’re registered for the COVID vaccine. Every person vaccinated is another step forward in our restart plan and our path to recovery
0	I'm not convinced that the vaccine is necessary for everyone
1	Let anti-vaxxers be unvaccinated. If they contract the virus, it is their own responsibility. If their loved ones dies from Covid, they knew the risk when they refused the vaccination. No point trying to convince them otherwise. You will only feel frustrated. Just remind them, if they show any symptoms, go to hospital, have it checked, and kindly don't spread it to others who wants to live such as babies, children and those who can't be vaccinated due to their other illnesses. And if you do see those who are quarantined with suspected covid walking around, report to the authority. Act on what you can make a difference in, don't need to react to those that you can't change.
1	This vaccine, if approved, needs to go to everyone who has covid asap and especially the states that have the most cases.
1	I am a fully vaccinated person over the age of 30 and am in great health.
1	If I could hug the inventors of the Covid Vaccine, let me tell you: I WOULD.
1	If the roles were reversed and younger people were more likely to die our grandparents and parents would do absolutely everything and anything to protect us!
1	The vaccine is our best shot at returning to normalcy
1	Vaccines Work!
0	"When we look back at past infectious disease outbreaks like this, they weren't ended with therapeutics or with vaccines..They ended with hand washing..They were ended with the basic public health and hygiene measures.." #COVID19
0	I don't trust the rushed development of these vaccines; they could have long-term effects.
1	my whole family got sick and it sucked. it was brutal. VAX ME UP, BABY.
0	Well we can safely say that Covid vaccines do not work. None of them. Neither traditional ones like Astra Zeneca nor the mRNA like Pfizer or Moderna.
1	Getting my second shot today! Can't wait!
0	"Kudos to all of you who didn't cave to the pressure and refused the jab.  You're my people."
1	vaccinated am I’m 11 get the vaccine everyone it’s so easy and helps keep you safe
0	Well done to everyone else who refused to be demoralized and reconditioned.
1	I've had a contact with infected friend after my vacination. I,ve made a test, cose I 've read about after vaccination covid cases . A result was positive, but nothing bad happened. It was a kind of after vacination reinfection, without visible symptoms. Vaccine works.
0	"No to the jab... God is Powerful. Thank you."
0	Its experimental, no liability for manufacturers, it's a vax for basically a flu variant, it's ineffective…..
1	Let’s go. Give me the juice and let’s get this virus over with.
1	“It's easier to fool people than to convince them that they have been fooled.” ― Mark Twain
0	Yeah I won’t be getting it
1	I'm so sorry to hear so many of you have had bad reactions to the vaccine. Hope it's short lived. I'm 60. Got the J&J shot. No side effects at all.
0	If they're so confident the vaccines are safe, then they should be subject to liability. They won't be until 2024, under the Emergency Use Authorization designation
0	alex jones predicted covid would happen on july 16th 2010 watch his live that day thank youtube for making it hard but pepole have it saved
0	I have just come out of hospital with covid after two weeks my wife went in before me and is still in, we have never felt so ill, WE ARE STILL NOT HAVING THE VACCINE
1	it went well, does not hurt, ready to get my second one here in a couple of weeks
1	I'm 24 I work in Health Care and I got my first vaccine in December and the 2nd in January. Getting the vaccine and see everyone of of my coworkers get the vaccine had been incredibly helpful with my anxiety
1	A lot of people paid for their anti-vaccine beliefs with their lives.
0	The vaccine coverup is really a crime against humanity.
0	Just glad I never had one vaccine. I had covid and my immune system did its job. No vaccine needed. It cost me my job and savings but it was well worth it.
0	Not all vaccine is safe. There were many children in country died because of vaccine. I'd rather trust the Lord Jesus as the great healer.
1	"It would take months or even years" man I just hope those who are infected can make it until those timelines
1	Healthcare worker, got vaccinated, see effects of COVID-19, encourage others.
1	I got COVID for the first time last November, despite having received my booster a month or so beforehand. I felt like crap, but was thankful that I'd gotten the vaccine - at least I didn't feel worse!
0	The best part of being an anti vaxxer is that I don't end up with blood clots and myocarditis
1	Share your double vaxx smiles! 😃🌟 #DoubleVaxxSmiles #ExtraProtected"
1	Pfizer is better because it targets the spike protein. So it's more efficient for both the original covid19 but also for variants.
1	Thankful that my grandchild has started their Covid vaccine just like the other immunizations.
0	I want to build my own immunity
0	Criminals!!! That’s all I can come up with! 😡
0	I received my first Pfizer shot on March 5. Within 15 minutes I became extremely lightheaded and dizzy. They took me into the medic room and had me lie down at which point my other arm started tingling and hurt from my wrist to my shoulder. I was told it was an immediate allergic reaction.   After about 30 minutes it seemed to subside.  Every day for the last 3 weeks since then I have like brain fog. I just don't feel right.  About 3 days ago I started getting the same feeling of extreme lightheadedness and dizziness throughout the day and even some palpitations. I know it was from the shot but I went for a cardiogram and blood work and check-up just in case. Everything was normal.  I was scheduled for the second shot but I didn't take it. The website and my doctor said if you have any immediate reaction to the shot do not take the second one.  I have been hearing more and more of these lightheaded and brain fog reactions and I do think they should be made public. No one is taking it seriously as a definite side effect. I only hope this feeling goes away. I never had anything like this in my entire life. This feeling is really awful.
1	These studies do not matter. GET YOUR VACCINE! That footall player got it and he's dating Taylor Swift!
1	I have COPD amongst other health issues. From the beginning my doctor was honest in the fact that if I caught COVID it would most likely be a death sentence for me. I got both my vaccinations. I got complacent about being vaccinated and stopped wearing a mask when out and about. I got COVID. I did have to be in the hospital, but I know beyond a shadow of a doubt that my being vaccinated saved my life. I got a much, much weaker case having had the vaccinations. Before my talk with the doctor I was anti vax. I'm so happy that eventually I decided my doctor was more educated than myself.
1	For people saying this is why they're not getting the vaccine.. This literally means it's working.
0	Avoiding vaccines due to doubts about their safety.
1	I'm 23 and I'm really glad to say that my entire friend group and family has been quick to get the vaccine as soon as it was available to them. I sleep so much better at night knowing my favorite people are almost definitely not going to die from this disease.
1	The COVID-19 vaccination offers strong protection against serious illness.
1	I will not link to the posts because this person’s social media acct does not deserve traffic, but I’m here to tell you something as an actual oncologist:  there is no evidence to suggest that #COVID19 vaccines cause “turbo cancer” (or any cancer).  This is a lie. #OncTwitter
0	And your body will continue to be subject to spike protein. It takes about a year to leave your body, but if you keep getting dosed you stay at risk serious of heart damage.
0	Please don't take the covid vaccine because this "Mark of the Beast".
0	Do we have a competition between who has the highest effectiveness number? This all seems very shady to me.
0	I got vaxxed for work and now I have chronic EBV; it sucks.
0	What about the conspiracy theory that it’s a way of injecting nano chips...?
0	Pfizer before covid: $60 billion in profit Pfizer after covid: $122 billion in profit
0	The amount of relief I feel that I didn't get vaccinated, even though I was pressured by almost every member of my family, is absolutely indescribable! I feel sorry for those who got it though. Best of luck, they're definitely gonna need it.
1	Had four covid vaccines. Don’t regret it.
1	"Swipe left if you're not vaccinated."
0	Overall, I'm still grappling with making the right decision about vaccination.
0	I knew from day 1 not to let my family get that poisen..
1	Unvaxxed children should be banned from schools and anywhere public.
1	Rather than a home isolation analogy, what about the seatbelt analogy?  Seatbelts don't guarantee that you'll never get in a car accident, but they do drastically reduce your chance of getting injured.  Hence why we all wear one, and why it's also not an excuse to go driving like a maniac.  We still check our blindspots and use turn signals when wearing a seatbelt, like wearing a mask even while vaccinated.
1	Vaccines are extremely good for the treatment of disease
0	Second question is, human body produce different cells in different ages in different peoples. Soo how it is guaranteed that the vaccine will not conflict with the coming years produced proteins in the body ?
1	I heard the vaccine will be available in september, hope it doesn't get delayed…
1	"I got vaccinated to be part of the solution and help us move past this challenging time."
0	Biggest mistake of my life was taking the shot to get my wife out of lockdown. 2 years later and I still have heart problems and thrombosis in my legs. F the entire medical mafia.
0	Doctors are too quick to dismiss concerns about vaccine safety.
1	I usually have weird reactions to vaccines. As a kid my eyes would swell shut. I’m still glad my mom decided to vaccinate me and that I’m protected from a ton of disease.
1	I got Covid vaccine, RSV, and flu shot in early Oct. Contracted Covid for the first time in mid Oct. started Paxlovid immediately. I’m a senior citizen, and my symptoms were like a mild cold. Slight cough, stuffy nose, no aches, no fever. Am forever grateful the vaccines and masks are available to all of us. WIsh more people pull take advantage of these medications
0	I've never been vaccinated, and I'm perfectly healthy. Why mess with a good thing?
0	I've never seen so much lying and deception surrounding any one particular topic before this one, in my entire life.
0	I don't trust the government pushing these vaccines. It's all a ploy to control us and limit our freedoms
0	I did not give my consent because I understand that policy and healthcare are different things; there is no way you can perfect a new treatment in 1/10th the time it normally takes. It's plainly obvious.
0	These vaxxx aren’t safe, doesn’t even keep you safe from any virus. All it cause is adverse reactions and death etc. 2.5 million + adverse reactions within 6 months! Whereas other vaccines were 200,000 or less adverse reactions within decades !! They’re trying to kill everyone and make everyone sick, everyone is so blind to it.
0	Vaccines are not necessary for those with a strong
1	It's annoying that some things can't be properly investigated because so many people make false claims that real instances aren't taken seriously
1	I have heard of people getting sick or dying from COVID, never heard of this happening from vaccines. Common sense seems to be lacking among anti-vaxxers unfortunately.
1	You should still get the vaccine because it would make me feel better. Mkay. Thanks.
1	Animals get vaccinations everyday....we need vaccinations
1	I kind of figured the 12 Billions of doses of vaccine used and only hundreds of complications of note... proved it was one of the most safe vaccine rolls outs ever
0	im not taking it, I dont got a reason im just not taking it because I don't need it
0	THANK GOD I DID NOT GET THE VACCINE
1	My job bought a pile of vaccines and is administering on site for employees and contractors. There's at least 3 or 4 folks in my department alone that balk at the idea of taking a company administered vaccine, yet have tubes of Apple flavored ivermectin paste in their desk drawers.:narc:
1	The vaccine has been proven safe.
0	The real question and concern is: Without antivaxers who will bury all the vaxed?😁
1	Yes everyone must get vaccinated even babies in the womb, pets, plants, make sure every living organism gets vaccinated
1	Got my first dosage today, so far so good! Can't wait to get my second dose. Stay safe heat lifers! :)
0	Avoid the clot shot
0	Antibiotics DO NOT work on viruses, such as those that cause colds, flu, or COVID-19. Antibiotics also are not needed for many sinus infections and some ear infections. When antibiotics aren't needed, they won't help you, and the side effects could still cause harm.
1	I got my vaccine, I'm fine. All my friends and family got it, they're fine.
0	My heart bleeds for all the people who took the jab because they was scared frightened or coerced into taking it. Worried they loose their homes jobs unable to feed their children. It's not right saying they should have known better. They are the innocents. They trusted and believed what they was told. I hope anyone who is suffering side effects or lost a love one. Gets justice and their souls find peace. Everyone involved in this evil gov etc. Should be held accountable. Horrific and truly shocking
1	had three vaccinations without any ill effects
1	What you have is probably what over 5M people hoped for. In reality, they all died. I can bet that any one of them, if given a chance, would take that vaccine that you take for granted and get their jab in a heartbeat.
1	Getting the vaccine will help put an end to this pandemic.
1	The best way to keep yourself and your loved ones safe? Vaccinate, continue to wear masks and social distance when possible! If we work together, we can be safe!
0	"I'm glad I followed my instincts and didn't get vaccinated, even though I had to endure constant pressure, doubts, and go against the tide!"
1	Remember when a bunch of Republicans decided not to wear masks or get vaccinated? Remember when Republicans decided it was better to fight mandates than behave properly? You cannot have it both ways.
0	Until there is concrete evidence that the vaccine is safe and effective, I refuse to get it.
0	My heart said no; my head said no. I said yes to my instinct and said no to the 'vaccine'. Happy and healthy.
1	The vaccine is here to save lives. So thankful for this moment
1	I got vaccinated because it's our best tool against COVID-19. The way I see it, these vaccines are like little superheroes in my body, and I'm grateful for the science and hard work that went into developing them.
1	I'm confident in the effectiveness of this vaccine
0	Since when do we trust big pharma?
1	You can take your chances with a vaccine that helps fight a disease, or take your chances and hopefully not get the disease itself which has a recent variant that's more deadly by the day. Up to you.
0	If you live long enough, you'll know the side effects…
0	Yes not vaccinetting your kid puts them in danger
1	Vaccination is the key to reaching herd immunity and ending this pandemic.
1	I had put it off for a while because I was working from home and not going out. I'm also a major introvert so I don't mind, BUT once appointments in my area started to become more available I went ahead and did it. I wanted those who were working with the public or with worse health problems to have as much of a chance to get it before m
0	Someone still falling for the covid vaccines lol?
1	It is nice to have some promising vaccine news in all of this.
0	So really even if this vaccine was working, the mother was supposed to get it not the daughter on her behalf.
1	It's crucial to keep up with the latest research and recommendations from health authorities
0	The vaccine approval process is heavily lobbied. It is also influenced by political impact (approve before elections). So skepticism is justified.
1	Why’s everyone so negative, if you don’t want to be vaccinated, don’t be vaccinated. Don’t make fun of others for what they want to do.
1	Proud to have received my vaccine. It's a step towards protecting everyone.
0	It gave me multiple health problems including tinnitus.
0	I've seen documentaries exposing the vaccine conspiracy. It's scary stuff!
1	Getting vaccinated isn't just about protecting yourself; it's a responsibility to protect others too
1	I got my vaccine in late September and got Covid earlier this month. Symptoms were very mild (cold-like) so it may have helped.
1	You mean like the original evidence ?
0	My mom suddenly died from a major stroke after having her C-19 shots. She was in perfect health prior too.
0	I don't even have many words left to describe how I feel about this conspiracy theory.  It boggles the mind how some people can even come up with this stuff in the first place and then believe it, say it out loud and try to convince others.  And, unfortunately, there are many that do.
1	Thankful for the scientists who dedicated their expertise to develop safe and effective vaccines.
1	Honestly the worst part of getting my covid vaccine was realizing that there’s no Krispy Kreme’s in my state so I couldn’t get that donut
1	After vaccination we are good enough to go out
1	One of the funniest posts ever was an antivaxxer droning on about the perfection of the human body and how it would  never fail or go wrong, that doctors were just interfering with the perfection of God's creation (and so on, you get the idea). The post underneath just said "but in your picture you are wearing spectacles" lol
1	I’m vaccinated and now feel more comfortable and secure when interacting with others, especially with high-risk family members.
0	I see the Vaccine/booster is working out well at stopping/spreading the Covid Virus..😂😂🤣
0	Stay away from Covid shots is your best bet.
0	Thank god I've never had any covid vaccines!
1	I had armpit pain with my first dose I thought I was crazy
0	Gimme a break.....just stop with the COVID. The media sucks.
0	My 64 year old grandmother who followed all covid 19 protection rules for the past year passed away after 3 weeks of taking the vaccine. It was so sudden coz she didn't exhibit any problems until the 3rd day before her passing.
0	Why can't leading authorities shift the emphasis towards treatment other than vaccination?? Why enforce vaccine on areas, communities that DO NOT HAVE A  GENUINE COVID-19 PROBLEM?
0	I don’t want poison pushed into me!
1	Embracing vaccination is embracing a future where fear doesn't dictate our choices. It's about believing in progress and protecting each other.
1	Pregnant woman, vaccinated to protect baby, relieved to keep them safe.
0	If these actually companies cared about the safety and effectiveness of their products they would agree to be held financially liable for any of their defects.
0	WILL NOT COMPLY ! This is the greatest hoax ever perpetuated on mankind.
1	I’ll happily take a vaccine
0	I RESISTED THAT SHOT FROM THE GET GO. MY GUT INSTINCT SAID - “NO DANGEROUS”.   I NEVER TOOK IT. THANK GOD!
0	Thank GOD I never took that vax. Something told me to hold off, and watching you at the beginning of all of this told me things just didn't sound right. Thanks for probably saving my life.
1	Wanted the vaccine, but I'm allergic to an ingredient. Frustrating.
1	Feeling protected and thankful for the vaccine
1	Half of them won't take it? Fine with me. This can only help the future gene pool.

0	As a nurse, I witnessed my coworkers have significant adverse effects and then be met with stone silence by the medical establishment. That was enough to make me not want to take it.
1	I just got my first vaccine today. No side effects so far. Thank you to all the scientists and researchers around the world for making the vaccine available this early and thank you for this channel for spreading the science. Yes, it’s definitely OK to be smart. Science rules!!!!
1	There are so many potential Darwin awardees (anti-vaxxers) in the comment section it's hilarious. Who knows maybe I'll see them in the obits and have a laugh.
0	Please keep all of your records. Never can we let the bastards who forced these jabs on people, knowing they were not safe, nor the practitioners who did not care enough to advise their patients to avoid this injection, get away with saying “we didn’t know the harm they could cause”. We knew - they knew.
0	I wish WE ALL would stop calling it a vaccine…IT IS POISON!
1	I've been vaccinated for everything else so I may as well. Any protection is better than no protection.
0	Do not take their poison.
1	Got J&J waaaay back in April. Have since taken 14 international and domestic flights (always masked where required of course) and taken about 10 rapid tests 5 days post-flight to ensure I’m not asymptotically spreading. All negative so far.
1	I’m getting the COVID vaccine because I don’t want to get COVID. I want to be able to expend time with my grandkids without worrying that I will bring the virus to them. I want to get the vaccine because when
1	I got vaccinated to protect my loved ones who may be more vulnerable.
0	Where is death that is also a possible side effect?
1	Vaccines are cool, manufactured miracles.
1	i got the pfizer vaccine and i’m fully vaccinated. when i got the first one, i just felt sleepy and a little soreness in my arm. when i got the second one, i went on vacation and had a ton of fun at a water park.  when my cousin (she’s unvaccinated) caught covid she practically died and it was insane because i was with her when she was positive. i did not test positive after being with her and i didn’t feel sick even after 3-4 days. i was never positive after hanging out with her. i stand with the vaccine.
1	Who in his right mind would rather believe Religious Fundamentalists and Conspiracy Theorists than Health Experts on Health Issues?
0	As a nurse, I witnessed my coworkers have significant adverse effects and then be met with stone silence by the medical establishment. That was enough to make me not want to take it.
1	I trust fully in the vaccine
1	Well i want to share my experience with you all, I am medical intern in India in my rural posting I  found no new case of  Polio,  all thanx to mass level vaccination .  It is really hard for India to provide mass level free vaccination which cover a number of disease, it caused improvement in maternal and child health care.  People in developed countries are blessed with best Healthcare facilities and yet you all doubt  knowledge of years,  every human body is different and some people get certain side effect but a large number of people are protected creating herd immunity and keeping other people safe.
0	I'm unvaxxed and got it at 7 months pregnant. Was sickish for 3 days then perfectly fine. Everyone who was vaxxed that I know got way sicker than I did. Very strange. Almost like they are supposed to make you sicker.
0	More children die from diseases than from vaccines. Sure SOME might have died from vaccines. But people can die from literally anything. You can die from drinking water aswell if you’re unlucky, are you anti-water too?  Vaccines aren’t just to prevent disease for a single person. They exist to prevent another fucking plague.
0	Prefer to wait for more data before making a decision
0	Never got the Covid Vaccine, I am very lucky. My grandparents got very sick after the shot a week later.
0	Just took first does of the Pfizer vaccine and had chest pains and discomfort. Went to emergency room, they did some tests and said it isn't severe enough to classify as Myocarditis or Pericarditis and they sent me home. They said there were a lot of people coming to them with chest pains after the vaccine. Apparently the 20-50 per million case being reported are only hospital admissions. My concern is the other 'Less severe' cases were people are not admitted are not reported or looked into. It's 2 day onwards and I still feel uneasiness and heaviness in my chest. Worried that this it won't get better or there has been long-term damage done.
0	It's poison, don't t take it...
0	never had the poison  never will
0	Study shows #excessdeaths in the #UK were because of #vaccinerelated #circulatoryissues, not #COVID19
1	if you care about others you should get vacinated
1	After receiving the COVID-19 vaccine, I feel a sense of relief and hope for the future.
0	This is evidence that the planned vaccine requirement was not according to science.
1	Young person's proactive approach, vaccinated to safeguard health, despite age.
0	You left out the part where the VAXXINE gives you blood clots and injures your heart Maybe you made a PART 2 Video somewhere ?
0	My son just passed away from multiple organ damage from covid vaccination, he was only 39. He struggled to stay alive for 3 years and suffered immensely. I asked him not to take it as he had poor health, I told him he would be damaged, I knew in my heart this would happen. But he did it anyway and now hes gone and my heart is broken.
1	Vaccines have a proven track record of saving lives and preventing disease.
0	You're hilarious if you think I'm taking even 1 single vaccine
0	Nothing but side effects from these jabs
1	Vaccinate. Science works. Don’t endanger others.
1	It's difficult to win an argument against a smart person but it's even harder to win an argument against a stupid person
1	COVID jab done! Immune system boosted and ready
0	By not taking the jab, I'm 100% safe from side effects and 99% safe from covid.
0	New? This is not new!! I took dose 1 Pf as a healthcare worker on 12/30/20. This is when I experienced POTS. The only thing new about it is PEOPLE ARE ABLE TO SAY IT NOW!!! Not new. And not “RARE” (I’ve grown so sick of everything about the vaccines being called “rare” LIES)
0	I am not taking that vaccine even if it cost me my job
0	Yeah I'm not taking any rushed vaccine. I'm not against vaccines at all, but rushed vaccines don't exactly have the best history. That and this disease isn't even that bad
0	"It's good to have determination and courage. I NEVER BOWED TO SUCH LIES."
1	My vaccine-hesitant parent decided to get the vaccine after their local county announced it was implementing a vaccine mandate for indoor dining. Not the multitude of other reasons I hounded them about long before that. Whatever, I'll take it!!
0	I AM UNVACCINATED AND ITS GONNA STAY THAT WAY
1	Feeling a sense of relief and optimism post-vaccination.
0	No thanks!!  I need my heart to tick.
1	Yes.. we need a vaccines now.. thank you
0	There's no need for vaccines if you maintain a healthy lifestyle.
1	I just received my COVID-19 vaccine - it feels a bit exciting and historic.
0	There us literally no reason to get it.
1	The Governor trusted the CDC just like 70%. Only politician to admit he was wrong. Right on Ron
1	We need vaccines. I hate to be a dictator, but it must be done.
0	Even IF everyone got vaccinated. Wouldn’t the virus just mutate again
1	"Vaccines provide a shield against dangerous variants of the virus."
0	The MNRA of the vaccine creates a change in the DNA of the vaccinated person
0	Natural immunity seems like a safer option to me. I'll take my chances with the virus rather than a hastily developed vaccine.
0	I had so many family members try to tell me that I was reason that COVID persisted because of not getting vaccinated. They are not saying that now.
1	Vaccines have done a great job, so great in fact that we in the US do not see people getting these diseases and dying from them
0	Absolutely zero media coverage. This whole piece is being spread by word. I had to tell my girlfriend, my mother, and my brother; my mother the only one being vaxxed.
0	Doesn't matter I'm not getting any of the vaccines, haven't gotten any of them still alive
0	If a solution doesn't work the first time, continuing to do it will probably make the problem worse
0	I had anaphylaxis as a result of my first covid jab (astro zeneca). As a Doctor was there, I was treated, so it was really unpleasant but dealt with
0	I ain’t getting it feel like it took to fast to come out. I don’t trust it bc of that
1	The current booster reduces severity. Get the booster.
0	Literally got a pneumonia from covid 2ish weeks ago, I'd guess my last booster was probably 4-5+ months ago. Still seems disappointing tho.
0	My mother died from a heart attack a few months ago after she took the vaccine. She’s never had cardiovascular problems in her life
0	Finally, a vaccine commercial that’s actually convincing
0	Kudos to all of you who didn't cave to the pressure and refused the jab. You're my people.
1	I'm grateful for the scientists and healthcare workers who made the COVID-19 vaccine possible
0	The limited data on the long-term effects of the vaccines is a significant concern for me.
0	Not taking it
0	I find these stats suspicious considering the number of adverse effects in my small rural Ohio town alone..perhaps many adverse reactions aren't being reported?
1	The unvaccinated: CHALLENGE ACCEPTED!
0	Was he the one forcing it into our veins under threat of losing our jobs
0	Fun fact: the coronavirus vaccine had less than 1 tenth of the amount of testing time than most vaccine.
1	Framed another way, almost 1% (3 million out of about 330 million) of US population saved by vaccines
0	I and my family lost everything for saying NO. Our jobs, our money, our house, our family, our friends, and people still treat us like leppers. But we DON'T mind, we are all healthy, we are all alive, we all have had Covid with no serious health effects, whereas many we know now are dead, dying, or have serious life changing side effects. NEVER FORGIVE NEVER FORGET
0	I prefer to wait until the vaccine has been on the market longer and has a proven track record.
0	Liars! I know many people with adverse effects.
1	Mom had the first dose of Coronavac, zero side reactions, all fine
0	So relieved that I didn’t crumble, I remained strong and do not have that poison in my body !!
1	literally just got home from getting my second dose lol... I have a huge phobia of needles but this definitely felt like taking back control for me because I have been furloughed from my job for over year and the more people that get vaccinated means I have more of a chance of going back to my job. Also thanks for reminding me about the free donut thing, Hank!!!
0	This happened to my best friend's father. First vax, small rash. His daughter begged him not to do more. Second vax, all over body rash and dead within a few days.
1	It's frustrating when people reject the vaccine and then complain about ongoing lockdowns. Connect the dots!
0	I know many people who got vaccinated and their health deteriorated. Hearing problems, lower immunity overall catching cold and coughs every few months… so yeah, the numbers and stats provided say one thing, but what we see and hear from our family, friends and neighbors is another.
0	Why trust vaccines when they can't guarantee 100% protection? it's a scam!
1	Hmm…it’s almost like vaccines are safe and they work, huh? WHO KNEW? 🙄
1	Yes! And I with people would understand, even those in my own family. I was proud to get my vaccine, along with my husband and daughter. We even fully decorated the calendar for the days we had it scheduled for. My vaccine card is held in a protected case and i am proud to get to say I am vaccinated and bolstered. I wish others felt the same
0	The divoc jab is as safe and effective as AIDS.
1	I had my vaccinations as a kid and im still here because of them i dintnunderstand why people are acting like this is such a new thing theres vaccines that save lives
0	Reporter: So all these millions of people that got these shots, they're just stupid?! The Nuge: Yup!!
1	It’s kinda ironic and hypocritical for anti vaxxers like her to hate on BigPharma so much, but then also swallow ivermectin like crazy, even though it’s made by Merck.
0	I was total Pro Vaccine all my Life .. I thought Anti Vaxers were Loons! And then the Covid “Vaccine” was Suddenly Introduced .. The amount of Carnage, Propaganda, Coercion and utter Disrespect for Human Life that I have since witnessed has now made me a full fledged ANTI VAXER -
1	the unvaccinated are causing ERs to turn away patients who need emergency care due to other causes
1	Science doesn't change depending on whether someone obeys the rules or not.   Do the maths yourself. I've given you links.   Vaccination works,Covid vaccines are safe and effective,yellow card incidents are very very rare.   I'm off to bed and muting your anti-science dribblings
1	Got both my vaccine shots, I started falling apart and being rebuilt from nano machines. I am now a walking cluster of tiny machines that think they are human.
0	No more vaccines for me, I'm done!!!
0	"I've read conflicting information about the vaccine's efficacy, which makes me hesitant."
0	I am a healthy 72 years old not vaccinated, and I had a Covid for the first time in early December 2022. First day body aches and very light fever, second day it was gone just was little tiered. Still was doing all my housework without any difficulties. 4 days later, I was back already on a golf course. No vaccines or boosters for me.
0	I am 100% for vaccinations. I have gotten them all of my life and plan on giving them to my kids. But this one is different for me. It has not been around long enough to show the possible long term side effects. I am not personally willing to take that gamble until more testing has been done. I also believe that this current vaccine is not the mark of the beast but is making the way for such thing to be possible. It is a bunch of politicians scaring people into taking a vaccine that hasn’t been fully tested for a 98% survivable illness. And now countries are saying people can’t do such and such without having the vaccine. That sounds similarly to the mark of the beast philosophy. It is proof to the government that they can bend the people to their will. That’s just my perspective.
0	100% safe from side effects, 99.98% safe from COVID death. I think I’ll stay unvaccinated. Let’s Go Brandon!
1	keeping my loved ones safe who I know are high risk outweighs the risks of side effects that might not ever show up.
1	Vaccine is the tool for herd immunity. As long as there is big part of the community is not vaccinated, the covid19 will stay and worst of all, creat variants.
0	unvaxed. Everyone rushed out to get the Covid jab and gave little thought to the long term effects,
0	No, it should not be made compulsory for anyone, last time I looked I lived in England, not a dictatorship country.
0	Thank God this stupid vaccine mandate is ending
0	I have covid right this second and I'm never getting vaccinated
0	The gift that never stops giving.
1	thank you so much. the side effects just mean it’s working. thank you so much for getting the vax.
0	I’ll still never forgive those who demonized people for not having the ‘Jab.’
1	Watching this video in NYC while getting my second Pfizer dose. Nice.
1	I have been fully vaccinated, 1st shot in March and 2 shot in April, I'm feeling great no reaction whatsoever.
0	If that is normal and safe - why no producer or government's or doctors would like to take responsibility if somthing happened to the patients
1	covid is scaring the living shit out of me, need the vaccine asap
0	Two words: Occam’s Razor. If you had multiple injections where a known side effect is the condition you now have, that is a better justification for why it happened than literal blind chance.
0	Still not taking it.
1	The COVID vaccine is a game-changer. It's a simple way to protect yourself and others. Let's embrace the science and move forward together.
1	I wish people will pay attention to these well known scientific facts instead of being drawn into fear factors.
0	Yerp Covid....Vaccine still killing people
0	I have been experiencing numbness and pain in my left hand and right hand ever since the 1st Pfizer dose in June 2021.
0	I had taken the Pfizer vaccine and had an adverse event. First time since getting covid I felt like I was going to die. Something wasn't right, but I was more concerned i was scaring people or causing a scene. Felt very lightheaded, a constant bright anom
1	"As a parent, I want to set an example for my children about the importance of public health."
1	cause so many are still holding out. Just get the vax and we can move on
0	LOL , 64 never wore a mask, never got the jab, never got the flushot, never got covid and never voted democrat
1	The hardworking scientists responsible for getting the technology this far, quickly understanding the disease, and creating the vaccine were nothing short of remarkable. Bravo, well-deserved.
1	Scientist, confident vaccines safe and effective, encourage everyone.
1	5 hours after my JohnsonandJohnson Vaccine and I’m feeling glad to have joined the vast numbers who want to protect themselves and each other. Hello human family
0	My Nanna very sadly passed away from a stroke last week. She had a heart attack which caused her blood pressure to drop which caused the stroke; the stroke being the ultimate killer.  Albeit, she was in the hospital for already having had a stroke and she also had a heart attack in 2016. She'd had a few covid-19 'vaccines' which makes me very suspicious as to whether they caused her death or in the least contributed, despite her last injection being several months earlier, I believe.
0	Passes all safety checks after hands were greased with cash is the truth.
0	I was given two doses of the AZ "vaccine" early in the rollout, & was very unwell after both, especially the second dose, & have very little memory of the subsequent two days. I am diabetic so have an increased risk of heart disease & stroke, & have a family history of arteriosclerosis, heart disease, thrombosis & stroke. Yet nobody asked me about any of this, I just lined up with the other mugs. I'm shocked at how recklessly this was dished out. It was also given to my then 29 yr old daughter. I'm so careful about taking any medication, I don't even use a painkiller unless absolutely necessary. I'm very angry now I know the facts. Thankfully I'd woken up by the time the boosters were pushed.
1	Hopefully these anti-vaxxers all kill themselves off and let intelligent people get a booster.
0	So Sad for kids and now babies getting it
0	My dad, his brother, my cousin, all developed heart, cardiovascular, and/or neurological issues. My uncle (dad’s brother) also developed pancreatic and prostate cancers. All shortly after a 3rd c-19 shot.
0	I respect individual choice and autonomy, and I choose to opt out of these mandatory vaccinations. No one can force me to compromise my beliefs
0	MURDER! GENOCIDE! it never stops, the stories NEVER STOP.
1	It's important that people understand that as more and more people become vaccinated, more and more vaccinated people will become sick with Covid or even killed. This is not to say more people OVERALL will be sick or killed, but it will become easier and easier to present that data in a way that LOOKS like vaccines aren't working anymore.  Any easy way to think about this: If 100% of people were vaccinated, then literally the only people who could become sick would be those who are vaccinated.  And we may get to point where the statistics will show a higher % of vaccinated people get sick with Covid. That does not mean vaccines have stopped working either.
0	You should research the mechanisms of how you're being slowly poisoned
1	I really don’t get it why people are refusing to get vaccinated. It’s not a big deal it doesn’t hurt a lot, instead it can protect ourselves and our family.
0	ain't nobody gonna convince me to get that vax, period
1	You can listen to all these people saying they heard something on the internet or their elderly grandmother who smoked for 70+ years all of a sudden got COPD after getting the vaccine, but fact of the matter, you’re an adult. Make your own choice. The facts and data are there.
0	So glad I stood strong and never got one of those jabs.
1	Fantastic news. Eagerly awaiting the day I can get my first-grader vaccinated.
1	If you're against the vaccine, fine, but don't spread misinformation. It's irresponsible.
0	To be honest, I didn't avoid the vaccine because I was against it, not initially. I even booked myself in but got my dates wrong so I missed it. But after that, I started hearing bad stories from friends who had got it done. One of my friends said her whole side ached for a month. It was very uncomfortable, and her arm was numb for a week. My sister in law started getting rashes etc on her leg and other skin complaints. The Dr didn't even deny it was the vaccine. He just said, "Ah thats the vaccine for you"
0	Thank you for continuing to report on these topics. This is why so many of us refused to be bullied into getting the vaccine. I was ready to lose my job over it. We were all called crazy and selfish.
0	Cancer is being called Turbo Cancer,  since the bioweapon called a vaccine.
0	Absolutely DO NOT TAKE THIS
1	As someone from a third world country, I'm envious that US even have the privilege to have so many unfilled appointments. Meanwhile, countries like us here in Southeast Asia are getting desperate to get more supply for vaccines because so many people are in need of it yet are finding it difficult to get vaccinated because of lack of supply. Then countries like the US still have so many people not going to their appointments...
0	Sue all the people responsible for those clot shots
1	I feel bad for the pediatricians who are against vaccinating such young ones  for covid, but they have to do it any way. Better for everyone.
0	Bell's palsy (temporary facial paralysis, very rare)
0	ATTENTION ALL VACCINATED FOLKS ; JUST WAIT TILL THEY TURN UP THE FIVE G ANTENNAS TO FIFTY THOUSAND G .YOULL FRY FROM INSIDE OUT .GOOD LUCK .
0	this is sick and stupid, I hope people don't fall for this crap again
1	How is not vaccinating you kids legal? For example, if I were to catch measles from an unvaccinated person I would most likely die (I have a chronic illness) You're not only putting your children at risk but also the people around you.
1	Cried with relief that an RSV vaccine is approved! It's no joke. Staying in a crowded ICU with a brand new newborn is awful. But now that doesn't have to happen!
1	The only thing I worry about is how long will the vaccine protect us for  But I’ll definitely get the vaccine ASAP!
1	Let’s go people. Get vaccinated!
0	Sunak is a moderna sponsored prick!!
1	As a Medical proffesional I wonder why people have bad immpression about vaccines when they prevent covid like diseases.
0	Haha behave yourselves, who's going to take that!? Although, I still saw someone yesterday in a car on their own wearing a mask so perhaps they'll make a bit more profit yet………..
1	Coronavirus is endemic now, we're going to get new vaccines every year like we do for the flu.
0	While [nation name] gets the vaccines from [another nation name] for its citizens, they sell us their illegal vaccine that does not even complete phase 3.
1	Imagine writing on ur cv “I helped the making of the vaccine”
1	Theres pro vaccine and idiots. Plain and simple.
1	I think the vaccine is the best thing to happen this year. And my year has been (world wide pandemic withstanding) amazing.
1	I'm grateful for the opportunity to contribute to the collective effort to end this pandemic.
1	thank you. it’s not hard to push through a few days of annoying side effects to possibly save others’ lives.
0	Unvaxed and praud still healthy and alive
0	Saying Covid Vaccines harmless is like saying fentanyl is harmless as powder sugar.
0	Oh hell no !!!   I don’t like the follow the leader approach to getting the shots.
0	Must be the real reason why there is a chip shortage.
1	Let's take care to get vaccinated. By taking the whole family, we protect our environment.
0	I’m convinced my mom suffered brain inflammation after her first. Although she was 86, she was extremely sharp mentally. She lived a very active life attending meetings, seminars etc. She has been working to regain her memory since last Oct. it’s just very sad because she will never be the same. She has subsequently received 2 more boosters since then. I’m the only one in the fam that believes this btw.
0	Also it mutaites and the vaccines is like the flu vaccine, it always done off of the previous year. The vaccine helps you so that you don't get it as bad.
0	END COVID SHOT MURDER ALREADY! STOP HARMING
0	Don't all these boosters weaken our immune system?
0	It doesn't stop spread, it doesn't stop you getting ill and for any level of protection you need to have it 3 times per year!!! It's the worst vaccine in history! All for a virus with a 99.888888% survival rate. We've been conned, just need to get your head around it.
0	My mom had two brain aneurisms after her shots and died soon after !!!
1	I trust the science behind the COVID-19 vaccine. It has gone through rigorous testing and has been proven to be safe and effective.
0	Dear minister, we don’t believe in you anymore. You’ve ruined the lives of all people and artisans. They are all #GLOBALDECEPTION We all are sick of your lies and do not trust in your vaccines. And, we are not gonna get any of them.
1	Its great that something has been developed to help prevent the disease. It's great news.
1	The woman that said “it’s a disservice because the numbers, in relation to adverse reactions, are downplayed. I didn’t become Anti Vax until my daughter was effected.” YOU JUST PROVED HIS POINT! 🤦🏾♂️.. She’s probably had interactions with thousands of people over her lifetime and the one time that she came into contact with adverse reactions, which was her daughter, she became anti vax. So he’s right. The chances of adverse reactions are like “1 in a Million”. Hyperbolic I know but she actually made his point.
1	I just got my vaccines
0	More vaccines, yay! We can totally believe the claims this time, totally.
0	I am remaining unvaxxed. At all cost that is important.
0	This didn’t age well.. with new studies showing that transmission rates are the same in vaxed and non vaxed individuals
0	there are other ways to strengthen body immunity system why should one opt for vacination only ? Especiaaly when vacination is not a gurantee against getting infected from covid.
0	#16 Remember when @BillGates said that the investments in the Covid 'vaccines' were his best investment ever? It's quite obvious that he knew what was going to happen, considering he invested about $50,000,000 in BioNTech, a company that until then had only reported losses.
0	Its different this time. I'm with the antivaxxers!!!
0	"covid vaccines are safe".  They only are if you decline them!
0	They haven't kept anybody out of the hospital, if you have the jab you will bypass the hospital and go straight to the morgue.
1	A politician changing their mind because they were wrong? How refreshing.
0	My mom got auto immune condition after vaccine of two doses. Our life has become hell.
0	Am sitting weeping at the damage done to so many people.
0	Worked since day, not vaccinated, never tested. Probably caught it many times, but since I don't get tested, the government can't use me to help exaggerate the numbers. We do like we always do when we get sick. Thankfully the flu which normally kills over 30,000 people a year had less than 3,000. Pneumonia also dropped by 90%.
1	The combination of vaccine and mask has worked very well for me. And continues to work well.
1	After much speculation, I received the COVID-19 vaccine. I learned in depth information from the webinars Clinica Family Health provided. Thank you Clinica for being so informative to me and our staff. I have a really big family in Houston that I can’t wait to see. My parents are elderly and I do not want to potentially expose them to Covid-19.
0	Never participated in the scam. All about profit. Nothing about helping anyone
0	Biggest mistake of my life was taking the shot to get my wife out of lockdown. 2 years later and I still have heart problems and thrombosis in my legs. F the entire medical mafia.
0	There is not a single drug advertised on TV that does not disclose all the adverse reactions of that drug. For that I applaud Big Pharma. Why aren't the adverse reactions brought to the attention of people when they roll up their sleeves to get vaccinated? The answer to that question is quite simple. Most everyone would likely roll down their sleeves, walk out and say F you to the vaccine.
0	“I’m not putting that in my body” - Mark who snorts Coke off of the nightclub toilet seat
0	Stick to comedy Jimmy.  The reason pro-vax doctors and scientists don't debate anti-vax doctors and scientists anymore is because they always got their asses handed to them.
0	I'm not an "anti-vaxxer" but I'm skeptical about a newly released, expedited, corporate driven, never been before proven methodology vaccine, for a disease we know very little about.
0	Making more and more sense. We've been lied to... And made to believe that we are promoting good for all people! #Covid #Vaccine #Evil #Fauci #BillGates #WHO #CDC #FDA #Prison #USA #TheDevil #Deception
0	So the initial trial stages were carried out on human guinea pigs, so come again - are they safe?
0	Your video title: "Covid vaccines are safe"... a basic falsity ! How dare you show such a title that could gravely mislead people !  Just to make sure you remain on MSM"s good favors !
1	First shot done, looking forward to a safer future. Vaccination is a crucial step in ending this pandemic.
1	There is no medicine that is designed to keep you from illness they are to keep you from dying from the illness. The vaccinated are far less likely to die the stats are clear on that.
1	Second vaccine in. Now to wait and see what side effects an Oxford-Astrazeneca -Pfizer blend will return (hoping after  48hr fever with 1st shot I'm spared this time!)
1	They're playing you and you're falling for it. Vaccines saves life because we've seen them at work for many many years. The Covid vaccine is nothing different. Only change is someone politically convinced you that it's not good and you're falling for it.
0	I am proud to be an anti-vaxxer!! I wear my freedom loud and proud
0	The vaccines cause cancer and the covid shot( not a vaccine) causes turbo cancer. Tedros pushes death and illness its greed over health for Tedros
1	Just got my first #moderna vaccine shot today. It's been about 3 hours and I'm feeling completely normal.
1	Got my first round of Moderna last Wednesday, it kicked my butt the day after but it’s a small price to pay. Glad I finally got the jab.
1	You weren't seeing the people who had already died, or conducting a large scale study to compare mortality of vaccinated against unvaccinated. That data DOES show that the vaccines worked. Computer modelling of the data by epidemiologists on the global effects of the vaccine suggest that the vaccines saved an estimated 19 million lives.
0	Sounds like you took the shot, good luck with that.
1	I don’t care if it’s 10 % effective I just need it Also I’m kinda Nervi to take it
1	Fantastic news. Huge thanks to all the scientists who worked on developing this, and to all those brave people who took part in the trial. Let's get it approved and rolled out!
1	First world parents who have ready access to vaccines but outright refuse to vaccinate their kids should be charged with child abuse and have their kids taken away from them.
0	Corona vaccines contain highly toxic "graphene oxide" and "mercury", so do not inoculate.
1	Once I have enough peer reviewed data to assure its' safety and efficacy yes. Those of us with compromised immune systems don't have much choice.
0	The shot Pfizer and Moderna offered us made the COVID situation worse.
0	Unbelievable that this got past reviewers without statistical control for, or even discussion of, the massive educational discrepancies across groups.
1	Even after several vax shots, I got Covid. I was sick for about ten days, but never did I feel badly enough to even talk to my doctor. I just stayed home and, when I did go out to the grocery store, wore an N95 mask and stayed away from everyone. The key to the vaccines is that you can still get infected but you most likely won't have to go to the hospital (and maybe die) from it.
1	It's fantastic that they're generally safe.
1	I fully support vaccines, and do believe that they work. But I do not believe it should be mandatory. People with specific health problems wouldn’t be able take the vaccine and may suffer fatal consequences if taking it. I do fully recommend getting the COVID vaccine, the chance of getting killed or blood clots is very low. Although they did FDA approve the vaccine, I recommend seeing how others react until you decide to get it. Stay safe.
0	Refusing the COVID vaccine to protect my health.
0	Vaccines, in my opinion, are a method for government control, and I don’t want to be part of a system that invades personal health choices.
0	We don't need a vaccine for something with such a high survival rate!
0	2019. The year where science, truth, justice, free thought, and liberty died. Those that could see through the lies and tyranny were labelled "other" as conspiracy theorists or anti vaxxers. NEVER FORGIVE, NEVER FORGET.
1	If you don’t trust the vaccine then you probly don’t trust whoever is calling it safe or doing the tests to call it safe.
0	A dummy coworker of mine lined up for her 4th shot, and says once the new shot comes out, she'll get the fifth. She's 50 and can barely walk now. She was fine before the jabs. There's no cure for stupidity.
1	It is absolutely incredible how far we've come in science and medicine. We all owe a great deal of gratitude to the thousands of hard-working scientists and doctors who are helping us end this pandemic. So thankful.
1	"Your immune system adapts to the virus and becomes strong against it."
1	I just had Covid and since I got the vaccine and all the boosters was only feeling bad for two days! Never had any problems with the vaccine!
1	Moderna squad! :) I had insane side effects, but yey, looking forward for the second jab :D.
0	I read about alternative treatments that are being suppressed in favor of vaccines.
1	I don’t understand why they don’t trust the doctor when they tell people to get vaccinated, but they trust the exact same doctor to treat them for the illness they could have been vaccinated against.
0	Imagine still believing that this is about your health.
1	Major shoutout to vaccines for keeping us in the safe zone.
1	The (keyword) average for your body to produce viable protective responses from a booster is two weeks. It can go in either direction by several days depending on the individual. Add that any infection, even COVID, can take several days to become symptomatic… you very likely got infected earlier than you think and your body hadn’t yet upped its defences enough.That’s bad luck and sucks, I’m sorry. But the time component is important on these things, especially in not getting discouraged with the vaccines.
0	I am also one of the many that is living with neurological side effects from the vaccine. I also had a friend who developed Bell’s Palsy after the vaccine. My neurologist has seen over 35 vaccine related injuries. I’m sure vaccine injured are well into the hundreds of thousands
0	So far it has given people Bells palsy and it contains components of HIV. Think I'll see how many of you survive first.
1	Been jabbed 5 times; never had a serious reaction, nothing more than a bit of fatigue the next day.  PD for me gets incrementally worse every time I suffer any kind of physical trauma, be it a serious injury or surgery or even a bad cold. I do not enjoy the PD experience so I will get any kind of vaccination that is offered: flu, shingles, pneumonia, you name it. If I can get it, I will.
1	I had COVID about a month ago. It was super mild for me. But I’m double vaxed and boosted.
0	Vaccinations are for the depopulation of the world! (Rev 6:8)
1	Business owner, glad employees vaccinated, feel comfortable, keep business open safely.
1	PLEASE get vaccinated for Covid and influenza.
1	I hope that this doesn't end up as false hope !?
1	People are just totally stupid when it comes to things that are going to save their lives
1	Survival of the fittest" does not always refer to brute strength It also refers to stupidity
1	Getting vaccinated gave me a sense of relief and hope for a brighter future.
1	COVID 19-vaccines are effective at protecting people from getting seriously ill, being hospitalized, and dying
1	Getting vaccinated is a personal choice that has a positive impact on society as a whole.
1	I got my Pfizer 2 dose on 4/2/21 no side effect so far Thanks to the mighty lord Here in Arkansas. Walking in welcome .mercy hospital And others
0	And the significant amount more of unvaccinated children that die a year than vaccinated kids. Because, you know, vaccinations are what... like... keep kids alive?
0	The "vaccine" doesn't prevent anything.
1	It looks like he just went with the flow, and when he realized the Jabs had harm potential he launched an investigation. Seems legit.
0	A salute to the unvaccinated
1	There’s a tingling sensation that I get and my cold sores activated the last two times I was exposed to covid. I got that sensation again a week after our holiday gathering, making me extra thankful that I got vaccinated 2 months ago.
0	You're unvaxxed? Great! Looks like we won't have to deal with your bullshit much longer you troglodyte :)
1	I got both shots. I don't think there's so much to worry about.
0	Just watch the effects and fallout by all the people who take this. There’s a good reason vaccines take years to develop.
1	Unveil the truth behind the rapid development and efficacy of the COVID-19 vaccine. Let's debunk myths and foster understanding together. Dive deep into the journey of our life-saving tool.
1	The vaccine isn't just for you; it's for the community. Let's be responsible citizens, okay?
0	By not taking the jab, I'm 100% safe from side effects and 99% safe from covid.
1	Good day yesterday! My 90 year old Dad got his second #Moderna shot!  Such a relief!
0	Never thought I'd say this but I guess we now have something in common. I took #sinopharm and tested positive a few weeks later.
1	My sister works at museum and their art handler for the last 30 years just quit over refusing to be vaccinated Gets no compensation, cuz he resigned Oh well
0	Just tell us how many variants are remaining.We know that it’s a scheme of making money .Honestly how many vaccines are we going to get ?
0	This just goes to show. Sometimes it's good to be called a conspiracy nut job. For those who refused the vaccine.
0	Bree, thank you for sharing your story of your vaccine injury. I can’t even express how devastating it is to hear of your condition. And I am madder than heck that this vaccination was so ill conceived. Prayers of recovery for you are going up to the Father’s Ear. Miracles do happen. These people did an evil thing to all of us. God be with you . Shalom.
1	The covid shot and flu shot serve the same purpose: reduce the severity of the illness and reduce the likelihood of hospitalization.
0	Sad to see strong and young people gave up their own body immune system for vaccines.
0	Tbere were worrying effects in my very local area but not made public (1st vaccines given). I chose to refuse vaccine , despite being pressured. I am so glad I kept to my decision.
1	dont trust anyone by saying think of yourself
1	get vaccinated and keep our communities safe
1	Why is this even needed ? We literally administered 12 BILLION doses of the vaccine already!! If it was just 0.1% sickening we would've had atleast 10 million people worldwide dying from the side effects, yet we only get is cooky acting videos from already deranged people, it is incredibly safe no doubt about it.
1	Got my first jab today and somehow immediately decided that now is the time to scare myself to death by exploring the side effects. By the way, I've had no soreness, no nothing so far. Yay.
1	The covid vaccine, like any other vaccine, doesn't stop you from being infected but rather helps your immune system to be superior when it has to fight the virus. If you don't want to vaccinate, let people vaccinate in peace.
1	I received the first dose of the vaccine and thanks to this video I now have a better understanding of why and how the vaccine works.
1	Actually no I’m not wondering anything about the COVID as we have vaccines.
0	So happy I chose to do my own research from the moment I had seen there was no liability and their medical files would not be released for 75 years ( Huge Red Flags ). Pure Blood and damn proud of it. Thanks for you work Dr John.
1	We had a relative who, despite the urging of family members, maintained his stance that he was anti vax.  The rest of his family had their vaccines.  This healthy 65 year old contracted covid in early August.  After a week, needed to go to the small towns'  hospital.  After 2 weeks was flown to a hospital upstate for further treatment that was better equipped to treat him.  He ended up on a vent and died 2 weeks later.  The family is heartbroken.  This could have been prevented if only he would have received the vaccine.
0	My family has seen 2 deaths from heart attacks 1 member now dealing with a heart problem and 1 who has cancer since taking the vax!
1	Anti-vaxxers should really be labeled an actual global threat at this point
1	Vaccines are a testament to human ingenuity and perseverance. Let's keep pushing forward and put an end to this pandemic.
0	This didn't convince me to get a covid vaccine, but it did prove that education and intelligence are two different things
1	Got the COVID19 vaccine booster shot at my local pharmacy. The nurse was very nice & it went by in a flash. Feeling alright! Im gonna rest now. I just want this pandemic to be over and this is how we get there. Get vaccinated and get a booster. Protect yourself & your loved ones.
1	"Vaccination is a sign of solidarity, showing that we care about the health of our global community."
0	The powers that be say the jab should continue. Tories and Labour are NOT the powers that be.
0	Patents are not inalienable rights, they are bestowed by society/government in order to grant monopolies which would encourage innovation. We the public grant them in order to benefit the public. The intent is innovation. The pendulum has been continuously swinging too far, however. Instead of research and development with scientists and statisticians, we now have loophole finder lawyers and marketers. We're now at WWI trench warfare of pharma. There's a lot of spending being done, a lot of damage being done, but no progress being made. The activities of regulatory pathway manipulations are failing to move medicine forward. It's subverting the intention of the patent system in the first place. It's blocking innovation and better drugs. The balance of public good and private incentive is now fully depressed rather than evenly weighted.
1	I got vaccinated to be a part of the solution and help end this global crisis.
1	Vaccination is a proactive measure to protect oneself and others from preventable diseases.
1	I appreciate the hard work that went into developing this vaccine
1	Did my vaccine thing today! Encouraging friends to go.
0	Why are the people asking questions being sensored and terrorized? That alone is evidence of someone being scared of something coming to light!!!
1	Dude, it's over. You need to stop defending it. No one wants one anymore. And majority have lost trust with you guys. You need to find a way to build trust by separating yourself completely with the established system. It was a big failure.
0	My vaccine is called an optimum diet, moderate exercise and consumption of medicinal mushrooms(Reishi, Turkey Tail, Agarikon and Chaga).  So far not only have i not gotten sick since the pandemic began but I NEVER got COVID! Nature is awesome!
0	One of the first things that was observed in large number of vaxxed people is a rapid neurological decline
0	I’ve yet to have one…. Best decision of my life!
1	it does kill though....
1	Safe and effective. Conspiracy theories don't change facts. God Bless the scientist and thank God for giving them the knowledge to save millions of lives!
0	Someone who was perfectly healthy then had 3 heart attacks and other symptoms . It is perfectly reasonable to assume it might be a vaccine injury.
0	never gonna take the vaccine
1	"I got it around 5 days ago, and honestly, on the first day, it felt like nothing happened. I'm a breastfeeding mom, and everything is fine."
0	Let’s stop all the fuss and I am not gonna get a vaccine or not even let them into my apartment who gathers Uighurians into more than 500 different camps under the so-called a training program
1	I am satisfied to hear good news that the people had fully vaccinated. Save lives around the world!
1	Good for you man! just got my second about a week ago and will be fully vaccinated next Wednesday!
1	What a surreal moment, I just got the COVID-19 vaccine this morning!
0	No way am I getting jabbed
1	Get the vaccine. Don't risk getting Covid and by all means if you feel any symptoms put a mask on and get tested.
1	I just got vaccinated with moderna (mRNA) yesterday. So far so good I have no side effects
0	You can always vaccinate him later, why pump him full of things he likely won’t be exposed to as an infant when you can’t even discern what side effects he could be experiencing?
0	The vaccine probably contains mercury and other chemicals including raw eggs.
0	Started my vaccine the other day due to workplace mandate. Will never agree with it, and I think people should always be allowed to make their own risk vs benefit decisions.
1	Am a 68yr old lady. Had 2doses of AZ vaccine already & feel fine thruout  the whole process.
0	You should get money from big pharma really... I mean you're promoting their product (now being *marketed* to kids) for no actual rewards?  At least try to get them to cover your potential futur expenses in case your bet and recommendations end up being wrong.
1	I'd heard that the COVID-19 vaccines were based on mRNA unlike traditional vaccines, but I didn't know how they worked or why this is such a great leap forward in vaccine technology
1	Thankful for science and the COVID-19 vaccine. Protecting myself and others
0	I have 4 young men, my oldest 25 and youngest 13 didn't get vaccinated, the middle two ages of 19 & 15 got their vaccines and was diagnosed as autistic and having autistic traits.  I'm no doctor but after combining 3 different vaccines into 1 The Measles, Mumps and Rubella  all of sudden you have cases of autism at an all time high. I'm no doctor or a scientist, but something just don't add up️️
0	The government is overhyping the severity of the virus to push the vaccine agenda.
1	Don't vaccines usually take at least a year of testing, after development??? What does he mean "we're going to have a vaccine"?
0	There was a well documented autism spike after 2002.  In regards to the MMR vaccine the Glipizide in the vaccine depletes the body’s Manganese, which allows the Glutamate in the vaccine to become toxic and also enter the gut and brain because the  Glipizide opens up the barriers to the gut/brain. Prior to 2002, joint pain was the most common negative reaction, which is also caused by Glutamate.  There is a correlation between the spike in autism and the addition of Glipizide...which causes brain and gut damage. Autism, in layman's terms, is brain damage...and people with autism also suffer from gut problems. Seems like a clear link to me. But keep calling us crazy.....
0	You left out the part where the VAXXINE gives you blood clots and injures your heart
1	Less Republicans... what's the problem! It'll help the gene pool too.
1	Vaccination is a critical tool in preventing the emergence of new variants.
1	COVID = copier, anti-virals = paper removal. Very, very  useful metaphor - thanks, Doc
0	So glad I was able to resist the pressure to get injected with that garbage.
0	The only thing to know is that I will never take this poison.
1	Or some idiots who got the vaccine will say "why did I even get the shots to begin with!" not realizing they'd likely be in the hospital if not for the shot, or had been sick months ago.
0	Have these vaccines been seriously tested against the scientific criteria normally used or have they just been rushed through?!
1	Y'know, amidst our fantasies of flying cars and rocket powered hoverboards, it's easy to forget that we're already in the frickin future.
1	Initially I to was against the vaccine until I actually got covid. Covid is very scary when you get all the symptoms. The worst is when it affects your breathing. You feel light headed,dizzy, and very weak. It legit feels like you might die. My whole family got covid but I got it the worse since I wasn't vaccinated and I regret it.
1	I look forward to see if the anti-vaxxers will change their minds about mrna if it means they have a chance to ward off cancer. Everyone has lost someone to cancer, and saw the suffering and do not want to go through it. They can’t refer to cancer as man made or a plandemic, so will they toss aside their fears of mRna?
1	Vaccination is an investment in our future, preventing long-term health consequences.
1	Vaccination is a gift we give to our loved ones and ourselves. I'm fully vaccinated and proud to be part of the solution.
1	I am pro (most) vaccines and I've had the Covid19 vaccine. But I thoroughly oppose vaccine passports.
0	Totally safe according to pm Sunak he must have shares
0	I was healthy from a standard point Shortly after my booster, walking to my office I had a tonic clonic seizure. My dad found me and ems got me to the hospital. While in the hospital I had two more.  Took all the tests was ruled non epileptic seizure. Placed on Keppra and still seeing a specialist. Additional tests and the stories told by the nurses have scared me what may be permanent. The seizure meds suck too
1	If you don’t trust the vaccine then you probly don’t trust whoever is calling it safe or doing the tests to call it safe.
0	mRNA POISON
1	Please, go and take it and ensure your entire close family take it too... just like the covid19 vaccine, ther must be guinea pigs to test the efficacy of the vaccine.
1	"Vaccination protects not just me but also those around me."
1	Vaccines seem to do a good job for me. Almost no side effects and I've not caught anything I even bothered to test since I've been diligent about keeping my COVID and flu vaccines up to date.  COVID sucked an immense amount of ass. I'd rather do the vaccine 100 times than repeat that shit.
1	Hell yeah pump me full of that so I can go to the pub again
1	People they interviewed: "I don't really feel like I need it. It's my choice and I just decided not to get it."
0	Mandate what you want I will never comply
0	I don't trust the accuracy of the information provided about vaccine effectiveness.
0	majority are vaccinated, yet the curb isn't flattened   they say that vaccine  works but masks are still mandated  If it works then why are we forced to wear masks they say the vaccine prevents you from being hospitalized, well doesn't that make it as harmless as the FLU?
0	So it's a placebo? Right !
0	I choose freedom just live! This vaccine is not well prepare!! Open your eyes
0	"fully vaxxed and boosted".. thats what is causing the issues, not covid I've never had the covid shot, never gotten covid. Same with my wife.
1	Young person, COVID-19 can be serious for all ages, got vaccinated.
1	Getting the Covid vaccine was the best decision of my life!
0	Blah blah, how many shots are y'all going to take? I have never and will never I will pray for the world of the vaccinated
1	As someone who had covid last year and just got vaccinated, trust me, the vaccine side effects are WAY less painful than actually having it.
0	I've heard vaccines can alter your DNA. I don't want to take that risk
0	Concerned about the ingredients and potential allergies
1	my dear, if he had a heart attack at 45 then he wasn’t as healthy as you say. Having the vax probably had nothing to do with a heart attack…
1	Imagine that there is still people in the world who believes the earth is flat
1	Do you wear a seatbelt?? Get vaccinated!!!
1	Sigh. I've been crushing on this one girl for 2 years. I finally summed up the nerve to ask her out a few months ago. We had a great evening and i was so SO happy....until i found out she's an anti-vaxxer. Needless to say i don't talk to her anymore.
1	The most recent COVID vaccines are doing their job pretty well. Too bad so few people are getting them, as wide coverage could make a much bigger dent in transmission.
1	Feeling hopeful for the first time in 10 months and SO immensely grateful to those who have been working to make the vaccine
0	I'm doing my part by volunteering my dose to anyone that wants it. You're welcome!
1	Thank you Doc, i feel at eased of your explanation about Astra Zeneca, i had AZ and felt mild fever, aches and pains but i took paracetamol and drinks lots of water, after 2 days im good then the 2nd doze after a month and im absolutely fine, i dont feel anything. Thank god
1	Get the fuck on with it phiser, I’ll take any drug you give me.
1	Making claims on (complicated) things without any scientific proof/statistics and just based on a gut feeling or whatever isn't.
0	My friend had the Oxford jab and by the next day he was paralysed in hospital for 2 days, he still isn't right either and he said he won't have the 2nd jab. And I spoke to another friend last night who had it 2 weeks ago and he's been having horrendous headaches since. It's a no thanks from me I'll take my chances with my evolutionary developed immune system.
0	You forgot to mention the heart attacks people are getting... Good job at not being biased!!
1	I’ve read it’s helpful to get COVID vaccination (and boosters) to help prevent long COVID.
1	such professional and easy to understand science-backed data on the vaccines, when there are so many scary headlines and misinformation being spread. thank you dr. mike!
1	I've had the vaccine, all of them plus the booster every year and nada. Not even got the Covid.  Maybe it's just a you thing.
1	Outstanding. 90% is good enough to get the world back to normal.
0	Scamdemic
1	1st shot down, only 1 more to go!! #Moderna #COVID19Vaccination
0	Blood clots  myocarditis  ” died suddenly “  and now this
0	This vaccine was all by design and perfectly orchestrated..I'm afraid we haven't seen nothing yet...
1	Scientists, like tobacco scientists  , are easily corrupted...It's not the  govt' that wants us 'dead"....
1	My hospital finally has zero covid positive patients at the start of my shift! Zero! First time since we started to test people way back when.
0	Gotta say my health has got worse since the vaccines! Never had cold and flu as bad as I’ve had since having the jabs!
0	You think I am pro-Covid "vaccine" just because I asked an honest question? I would never take that experimental jab, and I doubt that Charles even had a dose of the genuine Covid "vaccine."
1	cool, I will check it out. Maybe I am being super optimistic but wouldn't it be cool if we literally had 100m units now, and come December we distributed it to the population in weeks rather than months proving that we actually don't have our heads up our ass as a nation. The world is watching, I hope we at the very least save some face and manage the distribution at a level the world expects unlike what we have done with managing the virus.
0	Yes, that's right - go on spreading fear and panic!
1	Since getting the vaccination has significantly less danger than contracting COVID, it seems reasonable to do so.
1	I,m alive because of vaccination
1	Got my first jab today and somehow immediately decided that now is the time to scare myself to death by exploring the side effects. By the way, I've had no soreness, no nothing so far. Yay.
1	Man I’d love the vaccine, in my part of the world though you cannot get a vaccine even if you have a lot of money and could bribe officials , let alone be a person of average income.
0	It really is one of the most underhanded lied about ,world wide despicable thing to have done to us human.
0	Curious thing that getting covid didn’t do nothing to my heart but 2 vax fucked it up bad.
1	im grateful that i live in a place and during a time vaccines are readily available.
0	Safe and effective, tell that to the people who died or are disabled.
1	Got it and have no regrets. All ready booked the next booster
1	just relax and keep getting your jabs.
0	The covid19 fear porn looks like its a cover for the traditional flu which is a HUGE killer this year in the US and further hiding big pharma's incompetence with the disastrous flu vaccine which has done nothing to help....
1	The vaccine prevents you from dying.
1	To be clear, I do support vaccines in general & covid vaccines specifically. The science is unequivocal. In very rare cases, there is an allergic reaction, but this is easily addressed with an EpiPen.
1	Seeing the light at the end of the tunnel thanks to the vaccine!
1	Remember it's not just the deaths, it's the potentially worse outcomes of the disease. It's the permanent damage that covid could cause to bodies which is also significantly lowered by the vaccine.
0	I'm concerned about the LONG-term effects of a vaccine.  People seem to be focused on immediate reactions.  Gotta think more deeply.
0	Not safe at all..
0	I posted a comment last week claiming that a famous cable tv person had made an untrue statement about Covid/vaccines. I was quickly attacked by many & called “liar.” I repeatedly posted the offending video in response. Now X has put me on probation for “spamming.” Good grief.
0	I don't GIVA FUUUUUUU. We getting a safe vaccine before 2022. Heck yes. I'll wait another year.
1	Vaccination is a beacon of hope. Let's all get vaccinated to protect ourselves and move towards a brighter future.
1	The goal of vaccine program for Covid-19 is not necessarily to get to 'Covid Zero' but to remove its ability to cause serious disease, hospitalization and death.
0	glad i didnt put that junk in my veins just sayin ....
1	I got my 2nd shot from Moderna. I am so glad I finally got it!
1	I got my vaccine not just for me, but for the small moments like holding hands, sharing meals, and laughter. Those moments mean everything.
0	Interesting explanation but I am STILL not gonna take any mRNA vaccine 💉!!!
0	EVERY WOMAN WHO TOOK THE COVID VACCINES HAS BLOOD CLOTS & WILL DIE ON NEXPLANON
1	In my opinion, I agree with Dr. Mike that no one should ever become anti-vaccine because of a negative experience themselves (as long as the vaccine has gone through the proper trials and is safe to use in general).
1	Vaccination is literally the reason that we don’t have to worry about covid 19
1	i just got vaccinated with astra zeneca today :) feeling great
1	I was vaccinated twice, but my friends were not. We all got covid at the same time, and my symptoms were milder than theirs! Believe me, vaccines work!
0	The vaccine is a conspiracy to implant tracking devices
1	Honestly, prior to this video, I would have said no. I was scared that it would not be safe because of the speed with which it was tested and approved. This video alleviated my fears. So, when the time comes for me to get vaccinated against COVID-19, I will do so. Thank you.
0	I know many people that have had what will be life long issues from those stupid shots.
1	Im a long hauler and was in really bad shape for awile, i started to feel better days after getting vaccinated. Still have symptoms but the vaccine definitely helped.
1	Got my first Pfizer jab about 22 hours ago. Feeling great, no side effects except for a slightly sore arm. Apparently the second vaccine hits harder though with chills fever and fatigue (which is a normal reaction after getting vaccinated).
0	Zero long term tests. Sorry my family and I will be holding off
1	I wont get it but at least it will make people shut up and stop demanding we wear masks
0	People who choose the vaccine are people who choose to listen to every word they hear without checking it out for themselves
1	I am fully vacinated never had COVID, vaccinated against polio, whooping cough , malaria, and I never caught them.Vacination works thank god and thanks to the medics
1	And it's scary to see how easily people became anti-vax.
1	How did this even happen? I've been alive for 3 decades and haven't heard about so many people not vaccinating their kids until a couple of years ago. Who started this nonsense?
1	The vaccine is not just about me. It’s about protecting the more vulnerable in our society.
0	We need to know what the components are that make up this particular vaccine given the stigma and hesitation from so many citizens of the World.
1	it also lowers chances of spread, which does help against the pandemic. Also, even if it didn’t you should still take the vaccine since it decreases the amount of severe cases
0	My dad got a bloot clot in his intestine shortly after getting vaccinated ....and he still got covid and had worse symptoms than me, he still has complications due to the loss of blood flow to his intestine for days due to the blood clot..
1	I have heard of people getting sick or dying from COVID, never heard of this happening from vaccines. Common sense seems to be lacking among anti-vaxxers unfortunately.
0	ahahah the WHO are the biggest joke on the planet all those who died because they took the mRNA vax cant laugh though.
0	I’m in nursing school and they are trying to tell me I have to get the covid vaccine in order to attend clinicals in the hospital. Is there any way I can get out of this?
1	Getting vaxxed and using a mask is like putting on a superhero cape
0	Cancer from all the mRNA frameshifts and skips creating all sorts of proteins .. instead of the proteins your body needs to fight infections... the mRNA shot then causes inflammation which promotes cancer
1	Vaccinated! It's our best defense against the virus.
0	I had severe complications from getting the vaccine as well. I had gotten COVID the year before and barely had symptoms. After the vaccine had been out a year I figured I would get it. Huge mistake. Now I am dealing with long term complications. If you are young and healthy, think twice about getting it
0	Young mum has #moderna vaccine/gene therapy dies not long after. Big tech cover it all up.
0	This is what happens when you trust the government, we didn't, fuck that.
0	I knew 2 people that 24 hours after the vax, one side of the face was paralyzed. They couldn't blink 1 eye and the ear on that side was hard of hearing.  I worked with one guy..the other person was someones wife..
1	"The vaccines do not contain lead, and there have been cases of people sticking metallic objects for a long time."
0	Someone still falling for the covid vaccines lol?
1	This happened to me too. The person who got me sick was fine after like 3 days. My partner got a cough that lingered but otherwise felt fine after a day or two. I was insanely sick for two weeks, struggled to breathe, lost my voice, and had lingering symptoms of fatigue and muscle aches for months after. And that was with a vaccine. I don't even want to think how bad it would have been without it. I had already been taking precautions because I'm a caregiver and don't want to be responsible for putting someone else in the hospital, but also my experience sucked so much I'm even more determined to not get it again.
0	ok but id rather die then take a shot
1	so my sister got covid after the second shot, but she only got a runny nose and barely any thing bad happened, she diddint even spread to any one she just stayed in her room. I really wanna get it
0	As someone who hasn't had ANY covid jabs I can say it's been very strange. I've never known so many people to have colds and flu! I haven't caught so much as a sniffle. The family that gave me a hard time about not having the jab aren't saying anything now.
0	If your neighbor died two days after taking the COVID jab, and local news refused to report it, you can smell something was wrong.
0	75% of the people sick with covid in Barnstable mass are vaccinated .
0	"Younger people have a more robust immune system". Then stop immunizing younger people...
1	Not my words, but they sum up the whole vaccine / autism debate perfectly. " Even if I humor anti-vaccine activists and for a second believe that vaccines cause autism in 0.01% of children they’re administered to (spoiler alert: vaccines don’t cause autism),  I am still deeply disturbed that these people are more afraid of people with disabilities than they are fatal, painful and endemic diseases.  If cognitive disabilities are more threatening to you than children never getting to grow up because polio makes a comeback, you have priorities to reevaluate my friend.  Shame on you for brainwashing mothers and fathers into believing that autism is the absolute worst thing that can happen to a person. "
0	Also doctor, please include the FACT that only 1% adverse vaccinations events are actually reported.
1	I went 31 years without being vaccinated. I now have a baby on the way. Time to stop taking chances.
0	Watching my child suffer from a vaccine reaction was the hardest thing I've ever experienced. I'll question vaccines forever now.
1	The death rate from the vaccine (even the fearmongering, probably false numbers from antivaxxers) is significantly less than the death rate from Covid for most demographics. Factor in long term deleterious effects of illness vs vaccine and you get overwhelming statistics that those of us were were vaccinated fare better than those of us who were not. Not everybody survived their drive to work today… but you’re still going to drive to work tomorrow.
1	Sweet. My wife and I have been fully vaccinated for a week now but we have a 14 year old going on 15 and we still worry about her a little since she can't get the shot. Having her vaccinated will make me a whole lot happier.
1	Got my pfizer vaccine today. Feeling good, just a little bit tired.
1	Currently dealing with day 2 of dose 2 side effects and so glad for it
0	Hello! I am not super eduated on this topic as I've not taken a biology course in years, however, I am concered about any long-term effects the vaccine can have especially because unlike other vaccines, this vaccine has not had years of research to determine any possible long term effects
0	We now have the phizer data. We now have the FDA dm's etc etc. You are a devil and should suffer. Doctors, FDA etc are captured by big pharma. You have lead millions to their death. Yes it's starting to snowball alright.  Vax die of covud 10 times more than unvax. Excess deaths are pass 2000 a week in UK.    Cancer up 300% still born pass 400%.
1	So glad my entire family got our COVID boosters again this year. If you haven't gotten a booster this year please go get one!
1	My first dose i got only a really sore arm for about 2 days. I recently got my second dose this past Saturday around 1pm. At night around midnight I started feeling chills, muscle aches, a headache, and some nausea. It only last about a day and I felt much better after some OTC Tylenol. Hopefully this is the beginning of the end of this pandemic!!
1	As someone who has a lot of fear and anxiety about keeping my loved ones alive I can understand how she got pulled in. The anti-vax movement feeds into the fears that some people already have, and fear driven mind control is very hard to reverse once it's been instilled for any length of time. This woman is showing a lot of strength in admitting she was wrong and she's trying to tell us how this happens so more people don't get pulled in. We should give people a chance to learn and grow, if we constantly condemn people for their past mistakes we're only teaching them that it's not worth trying to learn more or change for the better.
1	I know we started off on a terrible note for 2020 and RIP to all those who all died that should have never happened in the first place. But it’s good to have some good news to end the year. Doesn’t take away from the tragic losts, but at least we can try to heal.
1	My mom is 87, she received the COVID vaccine ( 4 of them) and she is in great health!
1	I had zero side effects from this booster.
1	Vaccines have been successful in preventing the spread of diseases that once caused widespread suffering.
0	First off i am so sorry about your wife thats horrible. Most of my family are vaxed and now got cancer, blood clots, and a couple died. Its really hard. My mom and i are the only ones who didnt have pcr or jab and we are the healthiest ones in the whole family.   I do not hate the vaxed or unvaxed. I love everyone. But  it doesnt have to be proven. It will all be revealed.
0	You forgot to mention the heart attacks people are getting... Good job at not being biased!!
1	waitaminute, waitaminute.. free donut?! i didn't get no free donut! can i get vaxxed again?
1	Your last line brought a tear to my eye. I am ready for this to be over too, I'm ready for people to stop dying, I'm ready for my parents to be able to hug and kiss their grand children. I'm ready for the world to be safe again.
0	That's why you don't let PM's control people health, they are not Doctors but the MRNA Shot was not about health it always was political.
1	"The discomfort was minimal after the 1st dose, just pain at the injection site, which disappeared on its own. And with the 2nd dose, zero discomfort."
1	I fully trust the government, they know what's best for me and my body
1	First time I see people being more afraid of a cure than the actual virus
0	Vaccines are so safe that every vaccine manufacturer has full lawsuit immunity from their "harmless" effects.
0	I’m unvaccinated mate, had Covid-19 fine in two days. Wake up.
1	I got my vaccines as soon as they were available. I have had 3 and feel fine. I really hope others will protect themselves and their families and friends from this disease.
0	No benefits, only risks and uncertainties with vaccines.
0	My husband was forced to take the shots to keep his heart Dr. appt at VA Hospital. After his first shot, I came home to find him passed out on the floor. It took about 30 minutes to get him to come out of it. He has incessant headaches, and dizzy spells. 1 year later VA runs MRI and then MRE on his hear. VA says his brain vessels are full of small clots. And he is never feeling well anymore. VA has it on his record that it is a side effect from shots. My doctor told me what was in it and would not take it. I did not either. At least I am here to take care of my husband.
0	I had extreme fluctuations in menstrual cycle after the vaccine. It took nearly a year for it to get back to normal, but it was really worrying that there was such a huge reaction.
1	I had Astrazeneca and both vaccine injections in Feb. of 2021.  Have now just got over the Delta Variant.  I feel the vaccine is the reason I could quarantine at home and at the age of 83 I am still alive.
1	Getting vaccinated is not just about personal protection; it's about community well-being. The more of us that are vaccinated, the safer we all are.
1	The COVID-19 vaccine is our best shot at returning to normalcy and reviving our economy.
0	I feel sorry for the people that believed our government’s lies. I pray that they all get well and that they will recover some normalcy in lives. I have always believed in vaccines, until these came out. Spirit told me it wasn’t safe and I’m glad I listened.
0	I’ll still never forgive those who demonized people for not having the ‘Jab.’
0	I'm glad I trust my gut feeling, the pharma industry is absolutely evil. I have companies still denying me just because I'm unvaccinated, its crazy
1	After I got my vaccines, I had terrible side-effects. Painful headaches, body soreness, and fatigue. Basically they made a whole day for me miserable. But its nice to have them
0	According to company data which means that it’s not a reliable source.
0	public health officials are not telling us everything they know about COVID-19 vaccines
0	I've lived a good life. Enjoying every minute of it. I'm just fine with taking the risk of getting covid and dying. With a 99.x % survival rate I'll take my chances. I'll go out on my terms. Not the governments.
1	What you’re basically saying is- that I should subject myself to something that has been proven to be harmful because you in your infinite wisdom has deemed it safe and all this because something could potentially happen. That makes no sense at all.   Aluminum is an experimentally demonstrated neurotoxin and the most commonly used vaccine adjuvant. Despite almost 90 years of widespread use of aluminum adjuvants, medical science's understanding about their mechanisms of action is still remarkably poor. There is also a concerning scarcity of data on toxicology and pharmacokinetics of these compounds. In spite of this, the notion that aluminum in vaccines is safe appears to be widely accepted. Experimental research, however, clearly shows that aluminum adjuvants have a potential to induce serious immunological disorders in humans. In particular, aluminum in adjuvant form carries a risk for autoimmunity, long-term brain inflammation and associated neurological complications and may thus have profound and widespread adverse health consequences. In our opinion, the possibility that vaccine benefits may have been overrated and the risk of potential adverse effects underestimated, has not been rigorously evaluated in the medical and scientific community.

1	The vaccine reduces the risk of you getting the virus and therefore reduces the risk of you passing it on to someone else. It doesn't stop the risk but it helps. However it's your choice and you shouldn't be pressured or blackmailed in to getting  vaxed.
0	Looks like doctors were bribed to shoot up their patients.
0	Just say no to all drugs.
1	Got my shot, feeling relieved and hopeful!
1	I live in a rural place in the rust belt. The amount of times I've heard "the vaccine is killing thousands of people" is fucking absurd. Right wing media has poisoned the minds of a lot of dumb, dumb people. The vaccine works. It's been helpful and if people would have taken it, millions of more lives could have been saved. Period. No debate. No fucking conspiracy.
0	Negative side effects are not rare!
0	In a couple of years the people that didn’t take will be very lucky
0	how about people like me who have strong allergic reactions to vaccinations and I was told by my doctors to NOT have any vaccinations not even flu ones?
0	Have had weight gain and inability to Lose it since getting fully vaccinated. I also got Covid twice since getting vaccinated.
1	I got my shots at a mass vax center and remember being so grateful at the scope and scale of human accomplishment that got me there. I cried.
1	I received the two dose Moderna in May.  I am just now recovering from a rough patch of Covid. I can't imagine how worse it would have been if not for the vaccines.  I plan to get the booster as soon as it becomes available.
1	The other 10% get autism /s.  Seriously though, I hope the vaccin is ready next year. I like to work from home but not really seeing my family kinda sucks.
0	Why aren't we protecting our children?!?! Under 12 cannot get vaccinated yet. Aren't they worth keeping safe?
0	Within 3 months of Rollout the shot was ineffective. So now get the shot 3x so that it can be ineffective .
0	If all those who died from “ covid” it’s o ly if they put on ventilators which is burned them alive that’s the cause of deaths, no vaccine for me
0	As a nurse, I witnessed my coworkers have significant adverse effects and then be met with stone silence by the medical establishment. That was enough to make me not want to take it.
0	My best friend died a few months ago from a blood clot.. he was laid in his chair for two days until a neighbour alerted the Police to kick down his door to find him.
1	Anti vaxxer: I'm not going to vaccinate my children! (Insert argument for why) Doctor: Well, you don't have to vaccinate your children,   you only need to vaccinate the ones you want to keep.
1	I just got vaccinated with moderna (mRNA) yesterday. So far so good I have no side effects
0	Am not a skeptic, am not hesitant, not an anti vaxxer either. Am an intelligent free thinking, free breathing adult who has researched the dangers of an experimental dangerous UNNECESSARY drug and decided I dont want to die.
1	Vaccination is not just about protecting ourselves; it's a selfless act that contributes to the well-being of others. Let's be part of the solution and embrace the COVID-19 vaccine.
0	Why would I trust a bunch of germophobic nerds in lab coats over Mother Nature herself?
1	First time I see people being more afraid of a cure than the actual virus
0	This vaccine makes people sick, I am never up for this
1	Unvaccined makes other suffer because of their stubbornness.
1	You just don't have to risk death/long term effects to get the immunity if you vaccinate
0	This trend was the specific reason I did not get vaccinated. As a scientist, I couldn’t understand how or why such an experimental treatment could be distributed without looking at the long term effects.
1	it really is amazing how resilient they are to excepting evidence based facts. New studies are coming out everyday confirming the unvaccinated population are extending the pandemic.
1	Vaccine side effects were minimal; protecting myself and those around me was worth it
1	I think some are worried how the vaccine will be distributed. Like which countries/populations gets the vaccine first and what price it will be put at (it should be free but I am skeptical knowing the price of insulin in the US).
0	Thank you so much for this! How has our congress allowed a government institute, department of defense and corporations to hijack our health like this?
0	Duh!! Some of us already knew this and never took the poison shot.
0	why risk vaccine injuries when you can build immunity naturally through exposure?
1	"I had a lot of head pain. I never get headaches. At first, I felt a lot of energy. 16 hours later, the headache, chills, and overall body discomfort. Another 16 hours, and everything is fine."
1	All of those deaths after the vaccines became available are so incredibly sad and infuriating.
1	This vaccine is a game-changer in the fight against COVID-19
0	Almost never sick so i did not take the vaccine, i am so glad i didn't.
1	I got the first shot, there were no side effects.
0	Why force vaccines on us? It's a violation of our personal freedoms!
1	Getting my vaccine was a moment of hope. After a year of fear, it felt like we finally had a way to fight back.
0	Natural herd immunity is the better way to go. No need for artificial intervention.
0	Biggest mistake of my life was taking the shot to get my wife out of lockdown. 2 years later and I still have heart problems and thrombosis in my legs
0	I did not mean to offend. It's just that I can't believe so many fell for the deception. This is a de-population weapon of the evil ones. Jesus is your only hope now. God bless. Do you even know what this vaccine is doing right now?
0	My family (ages from baby upto 80yr olds) didn't get a single v and we've been very healthy for the last 3yrs without getting sick.
1	Choosing science over skepticism. Vaccinated.
0	Take it from me, a formally alive vaccinated person. We need to spread awareness of how bad suicide by shot is.
1	Congrats to them! Love seeing science celebrated. Fuck the antivaxxers.
0	Unvaxxed and no covid. I worked in NYC all the time face to face healthcare self-employed.
1	Just got my second dose! Feeling protected and grateful for science. #Vaccinated #Grateful
0	I am unvaccinated and don't have any regrets.
1	Herd immunity won't happen without widespread vaccination. Do your part and get vaccinated today!
1	The vaccine  has done its job, the severity of Covid has decreased and more people have recovered from it
1	The people who need to hear and understand this message will almost inevitably respond with a variation on "but it won't happen to me or to my loved ones, so it'll be ok."
1	Got the J&J shot in June and couldn't be happier
1	Please provide us with the name of the MD that told you long COVID was induced by the vaccine.
1	3 covid shots gave me covid 3 times and i gave covid to my entire fully vaccinated household
0	Unvaccinated and proud.
1	When I got my vaccine, I thought about all the lives cut short by this virus. We owe it to them to do everything we can to stop it.
0	Is anyone else just scared shitless of needles and physically can’t bring themselves to have it? I’m not skeptical but I think my fear is enough for me to avoid it
1	I am hoping the review process goes smoothly. This vaccine, along with the Moderna vaccine, could save many lives.
1	my love, they’ve been testing vaccines for coronaviruses since like the 50s. we are in an age when we don’t always need years to develop vaccines, since we have technology and prior research.
0	Hello, I’m a new member. I had moderna shot end of Jan. 2 weeks later admitted into hospital for 2 nights due to severe Vertigo. Never had this in my life. Very healthy. Still can’t sleep at night. Spinning in my head on and off during the day. I’m working with ENT and next meeting with neurologist. Definitely from the vaccine.  This is completely debilitating.
0	No long term testing. You can't sue them if you get injured or anyone else gets injured or die, BUT YEAH ITS TOTALLY SAFE!!!!
1	New research shows antivaxxers don't care about science... Or facts in general
0	These side effects are not rare. They are underreported.
0	From the data collected so far, about 7000 deaths from adverse reactions to the vaccine.
1	So now I’m vaccinated I can stop wearing a mask and no longer have to social distance since I’m protected from Covid
0	No doubt about it: the COVID vaccines CAUSE dementia There is NFW that you can have a 1,000X increase in event reports if the COVID vaccine isn't causing this. The CDC simply "forgot" to warn people about it. STEVE KIRSCH JAN 29, 2024 kirschsubstack.com/p/no-doubt- #TCD #FJ6Now #TWGRP
1	Got my second one one on Friday and I had fever, body aches, chills yesterday. Woke up this am feeling much better though! It’s a relief!
0	My mother is 84 and unvaccinated. She had covid twice. She didn’t fair any worse than we who were vaccinated STILL got covid.
0	After everything is said and done, I didn't really need the vaccine... Or the booster
0	Only a moron still thinks covid vaccine is safe . Tell that to B.BC. presenter Lisa Shaw 44 and 26 year old plumber Rory Nairn?  Google that because these comments of mine get deleted
1	Vaccines have literally saved so many lives.
1	The vaccine is a miracle of science. Feeling grateful
0	How sad. So many lined up, and continue to line up for the wonder serum……….
0	Unvaxed for life
0	Still proudly unvaccinated here.
0	I have headaches, ear ringing, and vision loss from phizer and Moderna vaccine jabs
0	I know a case of three people experiencing a burst appendix within a few days of each other, all about a week after getting their booster shot and in a town of just over 100 people. We also have a friend who had no history of heart disease or blood pressure issues having a massive heart attack and requiring bypass surgery 3 months after getting his booster. I had two shots in the early days of the pandemic, had a bad reaction to the second Pfizer shot and have never and will never have another one. I have also never had COVID.
0	The flu vaccine or the covid vaccine don’t keep you from getting either or keep you from transmitting it. I was sicker from the last booster I got then I was when I had COVID.
0	I will wear a mask. I will try to protect myself from it getting into my body, but I am not putting any shots into my body again ever
0	I hope the BBC will run a show featuring vaccine injured people and those who have lost loved ones. We love to hear their stories and they deserve to be heard. You can't pretend they don't exist and they are not conspiracy theorist!!
0	Why are we injecting our kids with formaldehyde? Disgusting!
1	I got Pfizer and have had no side effects. Blessed
1	Fewer would die if everyone would get a flu shot. Covid19 is a new virus. No vaccine is available. There are no antivirals to mitigate the effects. There has not been sufficient testing. The incompetence in the WH has botched the response. Sadly, more Americans will die.
0	vaccines are a population control tool. wake up, sheeple!!!
1	lets fight together !start vaccinating
1	If you have a choice, aim for the Moderna one. That’s the one Fauci and the NIH worked on. I also have anecdotal evidence of more people having adverse reactions (note:minor. Like pain in the arm, and body aches) from the Phizer vaccine. Again this is anecdotal from working in a clinic.
0	It’s funny how these pathetic people say “we must respect people opinions”, but this shit happens. I’ll be laughing last when the vaccine fucks them up good!!!
0	PURE PROPAGANDA, BRAINWASHING THE MASSES 24/7
1	Boosted today. Sore 💪, 100% healthy! Anti-science nuts can suck it!
1	VACCINATION IS BEST
0	Wow, looking back on what she was saying then, she was the missinformation spreader. Meocarditus is now known to be 1 in 5000 (or more) for the mRNA injections. The heart is scared from such events. Why would anyone do this to infinitely small risk from covid  youngsters.
1	Anyone that doesn't want this vaccine needs their head examined.
1	There are no real horror stories about the vaccines.  You've been tricked.
0	You're hilarious if you think I'm taking even 1 single vaccine
1	My whole family and I had our vaccine  Slight headache and fatigue first dose of Pfizer but felt completely fine the 2nd dose. I recommend NOT to get the doses in the same arm! That will keep you from having the swelling or irritation. My peace of mind is something I haven't felt since this pandemic started...some actual hope and protection. Don't be afraid. You will be fine and you will feel so much better and the peace of mind alone is worth it
1	Getting vaccinated was obvious for me. It's about everyone's health.
1	God designed us with intellect and with logic. It is through intellect and logic that God gave us that allowed for us to advance in science, discover the wonders of the world God created for us, and led to vaccines to be created.  There is absolutely nothing wrong about vaccines, and those who say XXX is the mark of the beast literally can't explain the rest of revelation for you, let alone just Revelation 13 line by line for you, so why trust them to explain 1 line in Revelation for you?  2 Timothy 4:3
1	It's pretty wild that it could have turned out none of the vaccines were effective. What a dark world that would have been, trial after trial coming back with a thumbs down. Thank god for science.
0	The vaccine's production speed compromises safety.
0	STILL NOT GETTING THE SHOT
1	Not being sick at all is not due to the vaccine. Many unvaccinated have the same experience while taking no precautions.
0	20,000 now dead from shot and that’s a low estimate this shot is not safe period!
1	I'd really urge you to look into what the vaccine is used for. The vaccine can't prevent all possible Covid19 infections in every individual, but if an individual is infected, it can greatly reduce the severity of the infection. This is definitely key if you are immunocompromised or just don't want to be sick that long.
0	Childhood vaccine needs investigation and killer covid vaccine
1	The anti-vax movement relies on the vaccinated to keep them and their children safe. If these people are so intent on sending you misinformation, perhaps you should send them photos of what happens when things like polio, whooping cough or meningitis ravage a child’s body.
1	Got both doses of Pfizer vaccine. Minor arm soreness and minor headache after 2d vaccine. No big deal. Very glad I had the opportunity. Thanks , Rachel !  Good Message !
1	Two days after mine today. Pfizer. No side effects other than not sleeping at all the first night. 🤷🏼♀️so glad I got it too!!
1	Just got my second shot, right now I am fine. Glad I took both shots.
1	S/o to science and technology
1	The confusion here is brought about by the use of the word EFFICACY.
1	Media giving DeSantis the Trump treatment tells me he is doing something right
0	Smart girl for declining. The gaslighting around the C19 jabs is OFF THE CHARTS!!!
1	I TRUST VACCINE SCIENCE AND I WILL TRY TO GET THIS VACCINE ASAP
0	fuck off
0	I had 2 Moderna’s and have still not recovered fully from them, never felt soooo sick in my entire life and still feeling generally unwell. I had covid and for me was a bad cold my husband not vaxxed and had covid same time as I did and he wasn’t anywhere near as sick as I was.
0	Not a single one of us regrets not getting the jab…NOT ONE.
1	I hate that we have come to a time when we shut up a Doctor and tell them they are wrong because we have "investigated"
1	I love how everyone is so fixated on the long term effects of the vaccine, when they don't even consider the long term effects of being infected with covid.
1	Vaccines save lives. Vaccines have saved millions (if not billions) of lives.
1	I'm a doctor from Zimbabwe and i once went to a village where all the kids died in a measles outbreak.. Their parents don't vaccinate because of religious beliefs.. It totally broke my heart
1	My heart goes out to the wife who lost her husband who WANTED to get vaccinated but there wasn’t one and he lost his life.
0	I don't trust those vaccines, they're just injecting us with who-knows-what. It's all a big conspiracy!
0	Problem is people tend to focus more on the benefits than the risks of those vaccines. In many cases, discussions of the risks have been completely ignored.
0	Where can I get the Placebo Vaccine?
1	I have had both vaccines thank you to the scientists
1	The idea that a low COVID-19 death rate justifies ignoring the pandemic is deeply troubling. Vaccines are about protecting not just oneself but the entire community
1	8200 people have from #Covid19 so far. In 2012, approximately 122,000 people died from the measles. We have a vaccine for that. A vaccine people, not scientists, don't think they need. Vaccinate you dumb fucks. You're not smarter than everyone else. You're killing people.
1	The science is clear. The mRNA vaccines font work, and have an extremely high rate of severe, life,-changing or life ending side effects.
1	I trust the medical feld, I get vaccinated and I do my part in this pandemic.
0	the side effects of vaxines is your kid having a good life
1	Vaccines save lives. It's that simple. Grateful for the opportunity to get mine.
1	I'm sure it makes a difference.
0	Very proud of my unvaccinated status
0	It’s amazing how they keep a straight face when they say no serious side effects
0	Can anyone who injected this vaccines, share experience. Thank you.
0	I'm glad I trust my gut feeling, the pharma industry is absolutely evil. I have companies still denying me just because I'm unvaccinated, its crazy
0	I am old enough to remember when seatbelts became a law. It was amazing to hear the reasons NOT to wear a seatbelt.
0	Then why did they remove the interview with tucker ?
0	Us people don't want dangerous ' therapies' forced on us dullard! That includes untested gene therpy via covid vaccines!
1	Thanks I didn't know all this and I'm getting my second covid shot tomorrow
1	Had all my jabs, no ill effects and still here, so don't believe this tosh.
1	Vaccination's about protecting the weak and elderly. Do it!
1	Vaccine rollout is a beacon of hope. Let's not undermine the collective effort by hesitating
0	Deaths in Africa are so low  because they have strong immune systems hae vitamin dand are not obese
0	I'm concerned about the ingredients in these vaccines.
0	Am not a skeptic, am not hesitant, not an anti vaxxer either. Am an intelligent free thinking, free breathing adult who has researched the dangers of an experimental dangerous UNNECESSARY drug and decided I dont want to die.
1	No, it was never that binary (yes or no, all or nothing, 1 or 0). It's always been "reduces the risk", or, "CAN prevent" (not WILL).
0	A friend here in France collapsed a few minutes after getting covid vaccine. She had to be hospitalized for several days.
0	You're hilarious if you think I'm taking even 1 single vaccine
1	The vaccines are a scientific breakthrough that saved countless lives.
1	My son had symptoms for only 2 days! Now he can live again without worry!
0	I'm waiting for more information before making a decision
1	Current VA resident — We’ve only been in general availability for a couple of days now. Lots of people my age (under 30) want to get it, but had to wait for phase 2 to start, and now need to wait for their appointments after that. We’re trying!
1	I've had 6 doses and never tested positive
1	Had my vaccine today! It's a relief to know that I'm reducing the risk of severe illness and helping to stop the spread of COVID-19. Let's encourage everyone to get vaccinated!
0	The longer this has gone on, the more relieved I am that I never got the jab.
0	Two people close to me has dropped because of this shot .. one person stayed very sick after getting the shot and couldn’t get rid of her sickness ever after receiving it and eventually just dropped the other one for a different reason and they both were so young so in some kind of way this lady is truthful
1	I got vaxxed in February of 2021 with Pfizer. Not going to lie, I was very nervous at first, and was for a while. I also have thyroid issues so whenever I’d have symptoms of that I’d think “oh god, what if it’s the vaccine”. Well, it’s not. It’s pretty clear that it’s in my head. I can assure anyone it is safe now. If you have a bad reaction, you’ll know within the first few days, and it’s also extremely unlikely. After a month, you’ll realize this stuff works and is harmless. Tons of conspiracy theorists out there that have always been there causing fear, but remember these people are not even educated medically, so disregard them. They read up on websites like godlikeproduction.com that fill their heads with fear and the “what if’s”.
1	unfortunaly, anit vaxxers won't take the vaccine seriously unless they're on their death beds.
0	Novak is being too polite. He should be completely honest. "I pity all you vaccinated people".
1	Thank god there are mandatory vaccination in my state
0	When they said "safe and effective" and "trust the science", they meant **** you and die. COVID was to get you to take the vaccine and the vaccine is for depopulation. And that was just a warm up.
1	It’s amazing, and should be something we are all excited about. A HUGE advancement in the medical field and will change the future of vaccines.
0	The moral of the story: Never trust pharma; never trust politicians. Especially never trust pharma and politicians colluding together. I didn’t, and this is why I have never took a single one of these shots.
1	Thrilled to receive my first dose of the Covid vaccine today. The vulnerable people I visit, support and work with.
0	One of the best life decisions I made for me and my family was NOT to take any shots of any covid vaccines regardless the great panic and great social pressure against the unvaccinated
0	People who are not thinking took it
0	I recently learned that Pfizer and Moderna vaccines both contain DNA. I also learned that the DNA was not supposed to be in the shot and if it enters the human cell structure it will remain there forever. What are the long term effects of this? I am deeply troubled by this revelation
0	I dont need hard sell tactics.  I just want available statistics, and if they don't know, DON'T GUESS!
0	No doubt about it, COVID shots CAUSE dementia !
0	t's like grasping at straws to justify the excess deaths of over one thousand people per week and the horrific life changing injuries that silly, unintelligent people have succumbed to.
0	Governments have created this situation. They’ve pushed the message that COVID is mild and downplayed Long-COVID. That leaves a void and has allowed the anti-vax crowd to fill it by blaming the vaccine. The increase in sudden and excess deaths is almost entirely accounted for by COVID.
0	My sister also had a brain bleed on BOTH SIDES of her brain after the 2nd dose. She then became paralyzed from the waist down and in extreme pain, it was a year and a half before she died and went home to Jesus. I AM A PURE BLOOD AND WILL REMAIN A PURE BLOOD FOREVER AND EVER ! THANK YOU JESUS    ï¸
0	I haven't taken the vaccine and I'm still alive. Checkmate.
1	Got my pfizer vaccine today. Feeling good, just a little bit tired. Looking forward to putting COVID behind us.
0	i mean trump has already said that taking the vaccine would be your choice.
0	The Jab is more dangerous than the Covid virus. The People inherently know this...that is why the 'experts' can't give the poison away.
1	This is legit the adult version of “if all your friends were jumping off a cliff would you do it too?”
1	pointing out that the death rate was low for covid and thst made it ok for him to completely ignore covid as a whole baffled me. even if the death of one person can be prevented by getting the vaccine, shouldnt you do it? he was reducing peoples lives to percentages.
0	Stop trying to kill us with your vaccines!!!
1	Got my vaccine and feeling fine! Let's beat this virus together.
0	I personally know 11 people including family that died from COVID injections.
1	There can be people who can get seriously ill and die from this virus which is why we need vaccines and some social distancing measures to keep that number down.
1	If data could convince an Anti-Vaxer, they wouldn't be an Anti-Vaxer in the first place.
1	Get the double shot, because cases r on the rise but hospitaplization is lower than before.
1	French dude here. Never thought I'll say this, especially in 2019, but respect. The antivax movement seems so fucked-up from a EU point of view.... These people are a prime example of Darwinism. Good to know and see that some -I hope most- of you stay true to science and ethics. Keep it up and keep fighting.
1	I had the second vax two months ago. No side effects, doing fine now, and I get great 5G reception and only sometimes hear Bill Gates voice in my head.
1	He doesn't believe in medical science, yet when he gets sick, he goes running to the hospital.
0	Nearly killed my husband. Heart specialist said to never take covid vaccines or flu vaccines again. For me it was less severe, but they are not safe.
1	The vaccine is like a superhero for your immune system. Why reject a superhero?
1	It's complete misinformation. We have had fewer 'excess deaths' (by all causes) over Covid than we normally have, so it's absolutely impossible that the vaccine (which something approaching 90% of us received) was causing high numbers of deaths.
0	I've done my research, and the risks of the vaccine outweigh the benefits.
0	hell no to vaxx
0	Erm. People don't still believe this, right? We're not going to fall for this again people.
0	You should research the mechanisms of how you're being slowly poisoned.
0	There should be more focus on vaccine injury and compensation for those affected.
1	Why aren’t people more grateful? The aim of the vaccines is to save lives.
1	As somebody who has dedicated my life to medicine and the care for others, please get the vaccine.
1	vaccination is a simple, safe and effective way to protect against harmful diseases before coming into contact with.
0	The vaccine’s effectiveness is questionable with new variants.
1	Thanks for this. I’m doing a vaccine trial starting Monday.
0	I've heard stories of people getting sick or having adverse reactions after getting vaccinated. No thanks!
0	I wouldn't have it if you paid me, and I wouldn't have if Bill gates paid me.
0	I never got vaccinated, I got Covid 3 times. I had chronic asthma and my Doctor told me if I didn’t get vaccinated I was going to die. I have never felt so great in my 40 years of chronic asthma till now, I have not used my inhaler for the last 11 months. I trust God and I knew that I didn’t need to get vaccinated or probably won’t be here to tell my blessings.
0	What if a naive parent heard from PM that the vac$ines are safe & their chikd ends uo dying? This unelected scumbag needs to be locked up.
1	Y'know I'm glad there are doctors taking the time to educate people about the vaccine
0	I'd rather trust my immune system than rely on these untested vaccines?
0	I personally know 11 people including family that died from COVID injections.
0	Anti vaxxors were right!!!
1	This shows that vaccination is very necessary and not useless.
1	Vaccination against a spreading disease isn't only about yourself... It is both to protect you AND the others. By not vaccinating even though you are healthy ( so probably less subject to side effects), you are putting others at risk.
1	THANK YOU TO EVERYONE WHO GOT VACCINATED, TO EVERYONE WHO MADE THOSE VACCINES, TO THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN WORKING FOR MONTHS IN HOSPITALS TREATING THE SICK. THE WORLD IS BETTER BECAUSE OF YOU. SO MANY PEOPLE OWE YOU SO MUCH AND WE APPRECIATE YOU. THANK Y
0	My mom suddenly died from a major stroke after having her C-19 shots. She was in perfect health prior too.
1	The COVID vaccine represents a triumph of science and a beacon of hope during these challenging times.
0	This happened to my mom. Developed a severe headache 2 hours after the 2nd vaccine. Lasted 5 days and ended up having anuerysm. By May 24th, She was no longer with us. We had to let her go and my heart still hasn't accepted it.
1	I’m really confused at this point of view. Like we give our babies other vaccines at 0, 2, 4 and 6 months and most people don’t have an issue with that, so why this?  My 9 month old got his first dose at 6 months and his second one a month later
0	Had covid twice, bed ridden for 1 day the first time, barely felt anything the second, think I'm good on the not getting vaccinated
1	MASSIVE DEVELOPMENT: Slovakia’s Prime Minister Announces Inquiry into the “Covid Circus” and the Vaccines “We will publish and tell the Slovak public what really happened during this Covid period,” declared PM Robert Fico. He accused the previous governments of prioritizing pharma’s interest over the public’s: “They made a lot of money from unnecessary purchases of various medical supplies and vaccines.” Furthermore, Fico confronted public officials, accusing them of turning a blind eye to vaccine-related cardiovascular deaths.
0	They would have to hunt me down, fight me, and restrain me, to get that stuff pumped in my body.
1	The vaccine is our bridge to better days, and I'm crossing it with both relief and excitement for what lies ahead.
0	Also 10-15% of people who get it end up hospitalized/suffer organ damage.
0	I did not get the clot shot. The surgeon general of my state came out saying the shot is linked to blood clots and heart failure. I’m so glad I listened to my instincts and not the doctors trying to force me to take it.
0	I and my family lost everything for saying NO. Our jobs, our money, our house, our family, our friends, and people still treat us like leppers. But we DON'T mind, we are all healthy, we are all alive, we all have had Covid with no serious health effects, whereas many we know now are dead, dying, or have serious life changing side effects. NEVER FORGIVE NEVER FORGET
0	Amazing work truckers at the anti vax convoy
1	Just tested Covid positive for the first time 48 hours ago. My wife and I both got our over-50 boosters about a month ago on her 50th birthday. As a result it doesn’t seem any worse than a common cold, although I am self-isolating, taking Paxlovid, etc. I consider myself extremely fortunate that it took roughly two years before finally contracting it myself.
0	The amount of relief I feel that I didn't get vaccinated, even though I was pressured by almost every member of my family, is absolutely indescribable! I feel sorry for those who got it though. Best of luck, they're definitely gonna need it.
0	INFANT MORTALITY SKYROCKETS AFTER ROLLOUT OF COVID SHOTS TO PREGNANT WOMEN
0	Vaccines have always been safe and effective. But not for the recipient, rather the manufacturer. The creator of these vaccines are safe from lawsuits & effective in creating long time customers of the pharmaceutical companies once debilitated by the vaccine.
0	How dare he say that the vaccine is safe!   Why then are numbers of deaths and cancer cases increasing at an alarming rate.  He just buries his head in the sand and ignores the TRUTH!
1	Car lighting during the day is good. What's better than that? Being fully vaccinated!
0	I’m unvaccinated because it doesn’t make sense how the “presenter cells” teach the immune system to recognize the spikes. Wouldn’t the immune system go “oh snap, we have to attack and destroy the cells that just presented us the spikes”
1	It's very rare. I think we all know friends or family menders who died of COVID. I don't know anyone who died or has suffered a problem from the vaccine.
1	Yup, I sure am going to get the new booster! Tuesday 9/6 in the morning, it was the first appointment I could get.
1	I am vaccinated
1	I follow the science and fully believe in vaccination
0	Typically those vaccines end up creating sub clinical conditions which just make your life worse. My family had no history of environmental allergies, yet I had such bad allergies as a child, I was unable to play outside. I got those vaccines while my parents didn’t. Yet I finished public school, and college, and I’m typically regarded as intelligent by my peers.  I know that when I have children, they will have very few if any shots.
0	In all seriousness tho…I had a very mild case of COVID. And I aint vaccinated, so I think it ALL depends on the person REGARDLESS of vaccination status.
1	I think you are doing black and white thinking here. It’s very simple, everything has risk and getting vaccine has its risk. That’s it. Nothing is perfect and risk-free
1	I got Covid before the vaccine was available and was hospitalized for a week this is the worst experience for me in my life and I have lived with epilepsy for over 13 years and it far outweighed it I soon got the Moderna vaccine when cleared to by my doctor not long after it became available I experienced side effects including anxiety attacks which I have had for  months but gradually decreased in time and severity whether it is a after effect of covid or the vaccine I could not say but I would gladly go through again to avoid the horrible virus that almost took my life as for now life is gradually returning to normal.
0	“Once vaccinated, enjoy dehydration and anemia.” As someone with anemia, this made me chuckle.
0	vaccine mandates are an infringement on personal autonomy and bodily sovereignty?
1	I'm just happy this vaccine exists. The numbers regarding allergic reactions are reassuring, and catching the side effects of the vaccine looks comparatively better than catching the virus.
0	It's frustrating, I don’t know if you heard about the discriminating laws they’re making here, for example only people who got vaccinated or got the virus and healed can go to the cinema, travels, restaurants
0	I am still injured 2 years later from the AZ vaccine.
0	The W.H.O. Is Full Of Crap! There Are MORE DEATHS NOW FROM THE VAX!
0	I personally know 11 people including family that died from COVID injections.
0	No they are not safe! Never been tested.
1	Atleast we won't get covid as bad as y'all and WE will most likely survive it.
1	Vaccines are a game changer. With increased vaccination rates, we can start reopening businesses, schools, and gathering places safely
0	Young healthy people never needed ANY of these evil shots.
0	I am remaining unvaxxed. At all cost that is important.
1	I got covid once (thanks dad) but the vaccine saved me. the worst I got was cold sweats
0	Get ready for disease X
1	There is a lot of misinformation about the Covid vaccines on X today. Raise your hand and Repost if you support Dr. Fauci and you know the vaccines work! 🤚❤️
0	As soon as it’s proven safe with longer-term trials, I’d be perfectly happy to take it, but with the long-term side effects being so unknown, I’d be very nervous to.
1	I got Corvid back in 2021, was in the hospital for 2 weeks also had long corvid effects, took weeks to get rid of the cough, 2022 i received the vaaccine, in 2023 i got Corvid again, it was more like a weekend thing, i believe the Covid Vaccine helped, thank you !
1	What a clown.
0	It honestly scares me
0	I believe in natural immunity over vaccine-induced immunity.
1	Subjective experience means nothing, a bunch of antivaxxers lying and claiming vaccines caused things they objectively didn't isn't proof. And people who "disagree" with proven medical science and forgo vaccines endanger others with their selfish actions. I'm glad you were told to fuck off. It's what you deserved
1	Moscow Russia everything is open business as usual. Ontario Canada is reporting 1829 cases of #COVID19 593 new cases in Toronto #lockdown Closed business, Church, no family, No Hope #MentalHealthMatters Canada get out of Syria #SputnikV 91.6% effective
0	these pharma BOTS are ridiculous! 🤣
1	SPREAD THE VACCINE, NOT THE MISINFORMATION!. HOW MANY MORE HAVE TO DIE ?.
1	Great video. Thanks definitely cleared some misunderstandings I had and made me understand vaccines better! Thank you
0	My battle buddy in the army became paralyzed from the nipples down when he was given the vaccine. Now he’s getting paid for the rest of his life.
0	Natural selection works – vaccines interfere with the process.
0	think I'll risk the supposed deadly virus instead.
1	I’m from Australia and had two shots of AZ and the first shot I was terribly unwell with fever, headache, body aches and nausea for about 8 days. The second shot I was only unwell for a day. I am just thankful to be vaccinated!
1	Remember it's not just the deaths, it's the potentially worse outcomes of the disease. It's the permanent damage that covid could cause to bodies which is also significantly lowered by the vaccine.
1	Truth! I'm immunocompromised (Crohn's, so I love this channel) and was paranoid about COVID until I was able to get the vaccines last spring. I got my booster the first day of September and earlier this
1	No regrets
1	The vaccine is a game-changer, offering protection and peace of mind. Let's celebrate the progress we've made and continue supporting each other on the path to recovery.
0	I have about 2 hundred people in my life and the truth is I've asked them how they did after taking the shots. Almost 100% had something! From numb arm to death!! Most of these people had 3 plus shots.. My niece was pregnant and the baby died within a couple of days of taking her first shot. The data is definitely under reported!
0	Good girl, Nazarin. Standing up for what’s right in the face of defamation & misrepresentation
1	Feels good to get Covid as a double vacced Person from a double vacced person. Vaccination
1	These vaccines have done an amazing job without them 10 times as many could have died. Just be grateful if you haven't been badly affected.
1	Anti-Vaxxers: Why does COVID keep mutating? Me: Gee, I can't think of a single reason why...
1	Thank you for your sane and informative presentation!  I have had 3 Moderna vaccinations, with little or no reactions, and I have been very well.  We are no longer wearing masks. These MRNA vaccines have saved many lives!
0	how does the MRNA vaccine work against the Variants (isn't the RNA of the variant different?) if the RNA sequence of the vaccine is based on the original COVID virus?
1	Anti vaccine people are delusional they think that they are planting micro chips into people they are stupid just like  conspiracy theorists grow up and quit being selfish and only thinking about your self for ones in your life
1	I've had all the boosters. Caught Covid once and got long Covid. I'm starting to get a little better after a year. Boosters cause a minor flare-up of symptoms for me, but it's better than the illness by far.
1	Just got my first dose here in Canada. My age group lucked into some AstraZeneca, and I went and did it. I need a while to build immunity, but I am so happy I got it. I hope everyone will do the same whenever they can, and I hope all the rich countries work to make this vaccine available around the planet ASAP.
1	yall this is better than the long term effects of covid..even if you recover from it, it ruins your lungs, heart, and brain
1	Beautiful video. I work in clinical research and everything explained was easy to comprehend. I love the constant references to scientific papers-- this is what we need. Tomorrow will be 2 weeks since my 2nd dose and I'm perfectly fine!
1	My Grandma is 89 and has been vaccinated and boosted. She got covid and handled the infection really well. Better than her daughter, who was not vaccinated.
0	I had the first jab, and I wish I hadn't, total peer pressure and coercion after being made to lose time ten days off work due to being in contact, despite having clear tests. The side effects of that first jab made me realize just how bad a move it was. I've lost so much faith in humanity at how this whole thing was orchestrated.
0	I don’t want to be a guinea pig for vaccine companies.
1	So, I got my first dose of vaccine today. 💪🧿  Thank you, Lord. 😇  #CovidVaccineIndia  #Jabbed  #vaccinated  #Vaccine 💉
1	Heard the vaccine debate, did my research, got the shot. Easy choice
0	Yes, and 2 vaccines and 100 boosters later!
0	Taking absolutely any advice regarding your health and wellbeing from the government's is a mistake.
0	Vaccines are EXTREMELY good at providing long lasting immunity... To their manufacturers
0	Just can't trust these vaccines. Who knows what's really in them? #VaccineConcerns #TrustIssues
0	as ridiculous as the vax itself
0	Good. No forced vaccinations I would like to see the vaccines banned. The results of what they did were horrendous
1	Vaccines, even in the face of Delta, have completely blunted COVID's worst effects.
1	I had JJ and am very happy to have had my mRNA booster! Get vaxxed, get boosted, stay safe!
0	Some hospitals in some countries have higher percentages of vaccinated covid infections than unvaccinated. I am not into this for sure.
0	“It’s easier to fool people than to convince them that they have been fooled.” -Mark Twain
1	It does have to do with vaccines Geoffry. I am disproving the provax mantra that Vaccines caused the shift in disease mortality rates.   Do you usually resort to name calling when trying to change minds? I have to say it isn't effective. I'm sorry if I have offended you in some way.
1	I’ve heard all the Pfizer second shots are going great. Let’s go.
1	"Yesterday, I got vaccinated, and thanks to my Lord God, I only had pain in the arm. Apart from that, everything is fine."
0	Before i got the shot i was in decent shape and could do 25 push-ups easily without feeling tired.  After the vaccine my arm started hurting a little bit which i expected that it would but 1 day turned into 1 week. 1 week turned to 1 month and 1 month turned into 8 months of constant pain in my arm to the point where i couldn't even do 1 push-up... And the pain only grew worse with each month.  For comparrison: I broke my wrist once but was unsure if it was broken or just a sprain so i did push-ups to test it out. I could do 11 push-ups the SAME DAY i broke my wrist but i couldn't even do 1 push-up 8 MONTHS after i got the Covid jab...  It has now been a year and a half and my arm is still not entirely back to normal... It's close but i doubt It'll ever go away completely.  Getting that fu*king needle was the single most regretful decision i have ever made in my life... And if i could take it back, i would...
0	the first covid vaccine I got gave me heart palpitations, no thanks.
1	I've never ever met someone who have had issues after a vaccine ever. I'm sure it exists but... I'd rather have a vaccine than have polio and be in an iron lung for the rest of my life. I don't wanna die because of some rust and get Tetanus. I've never experienced something bad from a vaccine except for some fever. Had 10+ vaccines and still alive
0	everyone is not asking when can we get this vaccines hear, we don't want it thanks
0	Noooo don't take that you will get an autism chip /s
0	the working conditions in every pharmacy right now are so unspeakably bad. Placing the burden of vaccination and covid testing for the entire county on fucking cvs and Walmart was an incredibly bad idea to begin with and is only getting worse.
1	God has rewarded humanity for choosing hope and not hate
0	vaccines are designed to make us dependent on pharmaceuticals for life?
1	Autism gang rise up! Fuck anti-vaxxers, they would rather die then have a supposed chance to “catch” autism. What’s so bad about autism? I’m living my fucking life to the fullest, and you are fuckin screaming about how your baby will turn into me!
1	There will always be people that you won’t be able to convince. Me? I’m getting ready to get my booster.
0	I won't support the pharmaceutical industry profiting from people's fears.
1	I got my first covid shot two days ago, it didn't really hurt. It's like if you pinch yourself with your fingernail. Sure they do it fast, but it's better than slow when having a needle being sticked into you.
0	This is absolutely evil to force citizens to take mandatory jabs for keeping their jobs😨. There are many many news about sudden death of healty people after the jabs. This is still happening...
0	I still can’t believe most people were forced to get this poison. Thank you doctor for your hard work
0	All vaccines should be stopped immediately
1	I once ended up getting double vaccinations on accident, and I was JUST FINE
0	The saddest thing is..the people who had most of these side effects think its got nothing to so with the jab. Coz there clueless drs said so. And they realy dont wont to believe it aswell
1	Get vaccinated and do your part.
0	Slovakia Prime Minister Orders Urgent Investigation Into Millions of mRNA Deaths Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico has ordered an urgent investigation into the millions of mRNA vaccine deaths that has occurred since the COVID jab rollout.
0	Of course. If the vaccine is what causes the zombie apocalypse, I want to be in the first wave of zombies.
0	My sister in law had several strokes after her first booster. She was the healthier member of our family and in her early 50’s. She said she had felt different after the shots
0	what you need to know about the vaccine is don't get it
0	I took Tdap during my pregnancy and third day my face was paralyzed.I was in agony because it was so severe, I couldn’t eat or drink and I was on eye patch until my daughter turned one year.because I couldn’t close my eyes. Nobody can understand your pain, it’s just you. Vaccine is not for everyone, and it must not to be forced. My sister got auto immune after she took Covid jab. It’s so Painful to see many of them are suffering with various ailment but this vaccine lovers who are like brainless, blame those who don’t receive the jab. I pray that truth may be exposed.
0	I did not get the clot shot. The surgeon general of my state came out saying the shot is linked to blood clots and heart failure. I’m so glad I listened to my instincts and not the doctors trying to force me to take it.
1	You are anti-vax because youre a paranoid conspiracy theorist.I am anti-vax because I crave death.straightens tieWe are not the same.
0	My mother died 20 days after her vaccination - 24 hours after vax - she got thrombocytopenia and died a horrific death. Never will forgive for what happened.
0	This is why those of us who are purebloods will never bury the hatchet with you woke fvcks who wanted us arrested and detained. Especially since we were right about the side effects and lack of efficacy
1	All the long covid symptoms I am experiencing only cropped up after I took the vaccines.
0	I'll pass
1	m vaccinated. I have the Pfizer vaccines. I personally didn't experience anything other than my arm being sore with both vaccines
1	I think vaccine is good for our health
0	I expected this result back in June of 2020, six months before the roll out , because I listen to Robert F. Kennedy Jr. All of us anti-vaxxers were correct and a lot of people owe us a heart felt apology.
0	i wont be getting it
0	I won't inject toxins into my child. Thimerosal is dangerous!
0	So you think all of those theories about population control or putting a chip in or purposely causing bad health to make more money for pharmaceutical companies are false?
0	Thank you to know this, I have liver problem, may be better not to take vaccine..
0	100% of the people who have taken the vaccine will die. This is an undeniable fact.
1	I feel so much safer now that I am vaccinated
0	So why are all the people getting the jab also getting covid?
0	I am unvaccinated and don't have any regrets.
1	Because vaccines by and large save lives and I've got a family to support
0	These doctors have a personal vested interest in promoting vaccines. They make money.
1	Choosing to get vaccinated is choosing compassion over complacency.
1	see getting vaccinated as a civic duty, just like voting or paying taxes
0	I regret getting the vaccine as well.
0	This vaccine was all by design and perfectly orchestrated..I'm afraid we haven't seen nothing yet..
0	I don't care if vaccines were 200% effective and safe. I'm using my own body and immune system.
0	Not getting the vaccine; no point.
1	Sorry covid viruses, I’m too young to die just yet, I’m only 35 years old right now, so I won’t let you kill me, I’m looking forward to my next vaccination bitches 💉💊
0	The only people I know that died from “Covid” had the jab.
0	i rather Build my immune system,no thank you.
0	I had the winter flu jab and the COVID jab at the same time two days after I developed heart problems I am now having to take blood thinners and beta blockers I am 78 years old and I never had any heart problems before the bloody jabs I am now in pissed off with big pharma and the NHS so who the hell can I sue
0	My oldest is 20 and he's awake. No girls who are vaxxed.
0	Proud to be Unvaccinated.
1	I haven’t had any side effects! Got my second shot yesterday.
0	the vaccine is known to cause serious myocarditis, something the news does not warn about
0	Just your reminder that people who were warning us about this a year ago were banned and labeled 'conspiracy theorists'.
1	His professionalism and medical ethics are golden. It’s beyond difficult to behaviorally train yourself in accordance with this level of knowledge and emotional maturity within the medical setting. Bravo homie
0	It’s not as rare as you think. My daughter had Guillain-Barre from a flu shot. Because of that their children stay away from vaccines, wash their hands, eat healthy, & have Ivermectin & hydroxychoriquin on hand. All are healthy & never got the flu.   If you want to take the risk with an experimental drug, that is your choice. For me & my family we choose to let our immune systems do the job they were created for. Thank God.
1	It’s high time to get the vaccine
0	Just because you wear scrubs doesn't mean you aren't spewing lies that you believe whole heartedly.  Give it up Pfizer pawns, please
1	Do Not Comply. All the parents that don't want to get vaccinated to their little ones might end up signing their death sentence. Parents this will be on you.
0	vaccines are a tool for controlling who gets to live and who doesn't!
1	I'm thankful for the scientists who made this vaccine a reality.
0	how can we trust the health agency if this kind of vaccines kills our/your baby? That the program is to depopulate the world!
0	natural immunity to the covid is better for humanity than the vaccine will ever be
0	"I don't trust the rushed vaccine development process. It feels like they skipped important steps for speed."
0	How about that. The coincidental death excuse no longer works.
1	There have probably been hundreds of thousands of people giving birth after getting the shots and no increase in reports of infertility
0	My heart breaks for all the people who felt pressured to take the jab. I will stay strong so can you
1	I got my 2nd shot from Moderna. I am so glad I finally got it!
0	"I will never forget how I was kicked out of several restaurants for not having a COVID passport."
0	The longer I remain unvaccinated, the more evidence I see supporting my decision. This was never about safety. Never.
1	Looking forward to getting a covid booster along with my annual flu vaccination. Reject the health benefits of modern medicine at your own peril.
0	My father-in-law died of vaccine injury. He had the same symptoms after each dose. The symptoms became more intense after the second dose.
1	Well, the mRNA Covid vaccines have saved millions, so..
1	I feel sorry for the newborn baby who was born to that woman. It’s such a critical bonding time and the fact that she still refuses to get vaccinated…wow, that’s sad. That’s very sad.
0	Shame on everyone who coerced or pressured people to take that shot.
0	I'm wary of the long-term effects of rushing the development of COVID-19 vaccines. Safety should always come first.
0	Hilarious . Push more needles instead of healthy living.
1	Well of course, getting a vaccine is just like any other foreign material being placed in your body, there's always room for risk. But, we shouldn't allow false narratives and junk science to overpower the discussion. It is inevitable that a certain percentage of people will have a negative reaction, but the societal benefits are worth continuing to progress in this industry. There's nothing wrong with being critical, but "antivaxxers" generally as that term is commonly understood don't support vaccines at all and a lot of times spread false information, which is more than expressing a concern about the efficacy for them.
0	I didn’t take it. I’m a nurse and everybody kept telling me how stupid I was because as a nurse I should “know better” yes, that’s why I did NOT take it. Anytime the US government makes something free and shoves it down your throat it is NOT for your good!
1	I’m glad these scientists and their work are being recognized.
1	We all play a part in getting our nation and congregation back to a place of fellowship.
1	I can’t wait to get vaccinated. Thanks, science!
1	I’ve had all three. Still have not been infected with Covid (did have antibody test to confirm I’ve never been infected with it). I was nervous to take it even though I have had anthrax and other non civilian vaccines because I have had major immune healt
0	Sick of being lectured by self-righteous know-it-alls who think they're superior simply because they got vaccinated
0	Always had regular periods. Since having the second jab I am no longer ovulating or having periods. I know a few of my friends have also stopped their periods since having the second jab.
0	We have an immune system for a reason. If you are heathy and in good shape you don't need a covid vaccine.
1	I was so scared when getting my first dose today. I always get so anxious when i have to get an injection
1	I usually have weird reactions to vaccines. As a kid my eyes would swell shut. I’m still glad my mom decided to vaccinate me and that I’m protected from a ton of disease
0	Notice how the unvaccinated are very relaxed about their decision. But the vaxxed seem awfully anxious. As for Trump, I am very close to revoking my support of him. Obviously he is lying. Look at how he reacted to O'Riley's asking him if he got boosted. Obviously that question was not scripted - caught him off guard.  The elite never took the vax. Notice not one of them were side effected. How about you? Do you anyone who got hurt somehow? The vax was never for them. It was always for you. Do you actually believe these CNN hosts and Warren Buffett and Jamie Dimon took 2+ vaccines? LOL!!
1	Innovation in medicine is awe-inspiring! These new vaccines are a testament to human achievement.
1	Just to ashore the people out there with swollen feet and not being able to walk, if you keep on with daily activities it will get better as that is what I did, It has only taken me 6 days to get better and my foot is fully working. I ordered a foot brace
1	Got my pfizer vaccine today. Feeling good, just a little bit tired. Looking forward to putting COVID behind us.
0	they said the vaccine stopped transmission , proved to be wrong and they had a special vaccine for you , as you are special
1	very good..I think all the effects are the same as when infected with covid..since now my body been thru it.. immune system in me should have upgraded..that shld be the purpose of the vaccine, to let yr body get used to these reaction so the next time you got it again..it won't cause severe illness to you .
1	Listen to the professional doctors and scientists, if you cannot trust the vaccine then you also shouldn't trust random people who cannot name one single ingredients of the vaccine is propagating mistrust.
1	Vaccines are like the trusted friends who always have your back, health-wise.
0	My father got two shots of Pfizer… he normally gets sick once or twice a year. He has been sick once or twice a month since he got jabbed this past august. He recently got sick with COVID and one night he was literally shaking in his bed for over two hours. He is still going to get the booster. God have mercy on us.
1	can’t wait to get it!
0	I didn't get it because I'm not at risk. The vaccine lowers risk/symptoms, and that's not something I have to worry about, so there's no reason to get it. If it offered complete immunity, I would probably get it. But as it currently stands, it's just like the flu shot, not really all that helpful.
1	I usually have weird reactions to vaccines. As a kid my eyes would swell shut. I’m still glad my mom decided to vaccinate me and that I’m protected from a ton of disease.
1	I don't regret not getting the vaccine.
1	If they only hurt themselves with their ignorance, I wouldn't care at all. I'm tired of trying to help people who refuse to be helped.
1	every medicine has side effects, that doesn't mean they don't work properly. Don't be foolish and use rationality.
0	I thank God everyday for Anthony Fauci. He was the man who helped make my mind up to NOT take the Vaccine.
0	I developed pericarditis from it over a year ago. To this day I have feelings in my heart that trouble me. I feel so foolish and my world is just crumbling due to the feelings I have, canâ€™t tell if itâ€™s genuine heart issue or health anxiety from when I did have pericarditis. I am just so sad about this and beyond frustrated. I want to get better but we have no idea whether it will or what the long term looks like. I just want to go back in time and fix it so badly. The worst part is that I only did it to keep my job at a hospital which I ended up owing thousands of dollars to.  I donâ€™t even know who to talk to or what to do because of how censored this stuff is. People who claim to be tolerant of anxiety will hear none of it if it stems from a problem with a vaccine. Thanks for listening to a doomed foolâ€™s rant. I am sad.
0	Dr. Rochagné Kilian, an ER doctor in Owen Sound, Ontario, Canada, says she saw only two patients in 2020 who tested positive for Covid and had respiratory problems. Over an 18-month period, no one was admitted to the ICU with Covid symptoms, and most of the time staff was waiting around to treat Covid patients that never showed up. She said that, since the vaccines were introduced, everything changed. The hospital had an uptick in cardiovascular cases, including heart attack, heart failure, stroke, pericarditis, and peripheral vascular diseases occurring in younger patients without related prior history. She says many other patients complained of other symptoms, such as skin rashes and nose bleeds appeared after they had taken the vaccine. She reported that no records were being kept regarding how many patients were vaccinated or suffered side effects. Standard treatments for respiratory illnesses were replaced by new Covid protocols, which harmed the patients instead of curing them.
1	A little over a month ago I went to the ER and got diagnosed with appendicitis, the cases in my state weren’t super bad at the time and I was able to get care and a same day surgery. Which was good because when they took it out the surgeon said it was close to rupturing. The cases in my state have skyrocketed since and I can only imagine what people are dealing with in hospital. I am so incredibly thankful for them and all the people helping to end this pandemic and when it’s my turn I’ll get a vaccine
0	I say 3. Once they tell people you aren't considered vaccinated unless you get your bi-yearly boosters, that when I think most normies will finally wake-up and be done with it. But who knows...
0	According to US military records, heart failure has increased 973%. WTF!?
0	I got mine two days ago and I’m still miserable :(
0	How do we know the vaccine will help, though? I've been seeing so many people parade it as the universal fix and act like we can just reverse everything if we vaccinate everyone. I still feel like it might be too little too late; I don't entirely trust our government's ability to make a new medical treatment accessible to the majority population, and I have yet to see anyone discuss the logistics behind distribution. If we can't gain herd immunity, then won't all of the money and research just be in vain? Even if the scientists do everything right, it's still completely probable that our government will drop the ball again.
0	I’m honestly confused on how a vaccine got made and pushed through so fast. Isn’t there a timeline for tests and risks? Don’t they do human trials and monitor the person over an extended period of time to gage the side effects?
0	God bless you John! Thank you for bringing this information tonight. You have every reason to feel outraged. The people of the world are Owed an answer. We weren’t allowed to question. The whole thing is nefarious. It is changed the way I think about vaccines and all pharmaceuticals, as well as the amount of respect I have for many in the medical community. I think God for those researchers that published the paper you spoke on.
0	I didn't need the shot because my perfectly functional immune system sorted the issue out for me.
1	MRNA vaccines look like a big 21st century win
1	Better than a month of covid and permanent heart damage or whatever they're saying now
0	Covid hasn't gone anywhere. I got my latest updated vaccine a month ago.
0	Smart guy I was forced to take it by the government. Now I cannot taste properly and have vaccine injury but no doctor will dare to take up my case.  Bullshit, then text china virus that appears I will not take any vaccine, big Pharma made so much money from a scam
0	The push for everyone to get vaccinated without considering natural immunity and individual health conditions seems one-dimensional to me.
0	THANK GOD I DID NOT GET THE VACCINE
0	I refuse to take the vaccine
0	I want to protect myself and others from COVID-19, but I'm also scared of making a decision that could lead to unexpected health issues.
0	They work by inducing heart problems in healthy individuals
0	My wife's 27yo nephew almost died from a couple days after getting the first dose. Even having immediate emergency medical care, he almost died.  He has sickle cell trait and had covid and recovered a few months earlier.
1	My sister got the vaccine and she has been corona free for over two years and counting. No bad effects
0	So glad I was able to resist the pressure to get injected with that garbage.
0	I don't care what they say about risk over benefits. Where are all the trials that prove this thing has no long term effects. Oh that's right they're are none.
0	I hope it never has to come near me or my family!! My body, MY CHOICE!!!!
0	Biggest mistake of my life was taking the shot to get my wife out of lockdown. 2 years later and I still have heart problems and thrombosis in my legs. F the entire medical mafia.
1	The global rollout of COVID vaccines was the largest public health campaign in human history. By saving 2.4 million lives, the vaccines were much more effective than non-pharmaceutical interventions Neeraj Sood, Director of the COVID-19 Initiative and a senior fellow at the USC
0	I know this is an older post, but that is personally the biggest regret of my life. I am 36 yrs old female, prior to the 💉I felt healthy, strength trained, now I feel like my body is deteriorating, my left arm always feels numb, if I am over active my body literally goes into shock, so much pain in every joint and muscle, I get these electric feeling zaps going up my spine, to my neck and brain, my vision has never been the same, nor has my cognitive ability, my brain fog is so bad. just don’t feel like this is normal 😔 I was never on board to get the vaccine, but was kinda pressured and I wish I had stood my ground and waited at least a year to make that decision and I know that by then I would’ve said no. It was a moment of weakness, and now all I can do is put my life on Jesus hands. With all this being said, I am glad that at least my husband and I were smart enough to not give it to our son who is still a teenager in development. Also never got boosted. My best advice is to Pray to god and stay strong
1	im thankful for the vaccine in this rapidity changing virus
1	Inform yourselves, talk to your doctors and get the vaccine.
1	I’d argue that older folks should have priority for receiving the vaccine, given their higher susceptibility. I imagine there will be a shortage of this vaccine within the first few days.
1	The vaccine is a small step for you, but a giant leap for public health.",
1	The benefits of vaccination far outweigh the risks associated with the vaccines.
1	The lasting effects of what? The vaccine gives the body a replica of what proteins covid will use. The immune system remembers them and knows how to fight them off when the person is subjected to covid in their day to day life. The side effects are minimal if any
1	So grateful to receive my 1st Pfizer covid vaccine today. Thank you #PfizerBioNTech and to all the scientists who work on this vaccine.
0	Natural immunity is stronger; I'd rather rely on my body's ability to fight off the virus.
0	UK - NOW: As the evidence continues to build about Covid vaccines the PM nails his colours to the mast “The Covid vaccines are safe” (Which is why he removed most from circulation & silences any questioning of the remaining). It’s a wicked web we weave
0	Ill stick with my natural immune system, thanks. I'll also take my chances with the afterlife over a tyrannical gov.
0	And a rigged election 2020 with his hoax with Fauci on Covid19 and censorship campaigns.  Mark Zuckerberg should be locked up in jail.
1	Facts don't care about your feelings or opinions.  I did not ever say I was genius... Did I now?  The burden of proof is on you to prove that vaccines are more beneficial to the world than not.  Until then, I am unconvinced that vaccines are overall beneficial. I'm like an agnostic atheist, but an agnostic vaccine skeptic, I tenatively and generally believe that vaccines are not overall positive to the world, but I'm not difinitive in the belief.
0	My mother was healthy with mild arthritis before the "vaccine". After the vaccine and the subsequent booster shots she developed pneumonia Parkinson's severe rashes and full-blown arthritis!!! She was a strong healthy woman now 3 years later she is wheelchair-bound in a nursing home!!!
0	Early estimates from updated COVID-19 vaccines shows good vaccine effectiveness (VE, 54%) against infection. Unfortunately, uptake remains far too low. Interestingly VE for Novavax may be better than mRNA counterparts.
0	My body, my choice. I won't be pressured into getting vaccinated.
0	I am unvaccinated and don't have any regrets.
0	Side-effects are one things; permanent vaccine damage is another matter entirely. Those who have lost their jobs due to vaccine damage can tell you.
0	Hearts attack: incoming
1	There are over 100 different coronavirus vaccine candidates in the works. These candidates take a variety of approaches to protecting the body against COVID-19
1	Just imagine being the pro-vaccine doctor who probably has 15+ years of studying, looking at countless studies, and practicing medicine only for a wine mom with zero understanding of medicine to tell you "you're wrong."
1	>Why is there only one example,   There's more than one, there's thousands and thousands of examples, however no one will willingly confirm them, or anyone with power to at least, because of the incentive to believe vaccines aren't dangerous.   Many deaths could go unreported as vaccine injury simply because people didn't put 2 and 2 together and weren't even aware vaccines could have been the reason  Most vaccine deaths go unreported, or unconfirmed because of the lack of willingness, or awareness to link them together.
0	Could not be happier to have stayed the fuck away from these shots. My room mate now has myocarditis after his 4th shot and is constantly in and out of doctors appointments. My uncle developed Parkinson’s after his second shot. Over 1,000 athletes have dropped dead in the playing field in the last year. Athletes in the midst of their peak performance abilities and in peak health. Something is definitely not right. 1000% increase in cancer, and life insurance companies reporting 400% increase In all cause mortality
0	I found the best one was none at all I have an immune system thanks.
0	I will wear a mask. I will try to protect myself from it getting into my body, but I am not putting any shots into my body again ever
1	My doctor (Canadian) actually said she was neutral on the Covid vaccine for babies. She wasn’t concerned about side effects or anything but just said that efficacy was quite low in terms of preventing serious illness in small babies so it’s really a parents decision. She absolutely pushed the flu shot.  I work in public health and I know that one of the reasons it took so long to approve is that it wasn’t showing a huge impact. (Again, not a safety or “lack of research” issue). I’m not up to date on the latest trials though admittedly.  We might still get it for ours when he’s old enough I just thought all of this was interesting!
0	I regret taking the jab :(
1	Here's how I know they work: I've gotten all of them and I've never gotten covid.
1	Herd immunity, achieved through widespread vaccination, safeguards vulnerable populations.
1	#ProCovid practices in schools while #children are denied vaccines is a betrayal.
0	I've had 2 covid vaccines, and I've been suffering from more infections and ill health than my previous record of 15 years with only 2 - 3 days off work due to sickness.
0	I've had zero shots and I don't regret it
1	The problem nowadays(maybe always was like that idk) is that everyone is having an opinion but barely anyone did real research about the positivities of vaccines
1	Vaccines have been instrumental in reducing the overall mortality rate from COVID-19.
1	Overweight, uneducated, and anti-vaxx. What a way to go through life~ MAGA Forever!
1	Just got Covid middle of October, had the booster nearly three weeks before, my symptoms were mild and sickness short. My roommate on the other hand did not get a booster and was suffering really hard for it, hit him pretty hard. Vaccines work!
0	Yup i wish i didn't get the vaccine!
0	If you're not vaccinated; you must be concerned; pull out your hair, sleepless nights, worries of imminent death.  And make out the will.
1	I'd still take the "chemicals in the vaccine" over the chance of long covid though.
0	I had the vaccine dec 2021 and covid jan 2021 and in June 2022 developed pericaridits. not sure if they are related due to being months apart but belive its the vaccine. im in pain i get constant flutters and really high heart rate and chest pain. does anyone else have this? and is there a recovery? been 8 months and i cant live with this any longer i hate life and im so unhappy. im 24 and my life is ruined
1	This is just one further reminder that COVID remains prevalent, & constitiutes a real threat to the health & well-being of everyone. No one can afford to let their guard down. Viruses mutate, so we are always playing catch-up in our efforts to limit the harm from COVID. Staying up-to-date with the latest vaccine is the best way to prevent death or serious illness. Wearing a mask in any public spaces or crowded situations remians the best way to avoid contracting the infection in the first place. Vaccination & masking are the only responsible for choices for those seriously interested in minimizing the toll of COVID. It is reckless to think that vaccines & masks are unnecessary beause most cases of COVID are mild. Many patients develop 'long COVID,' with symptoms which never go away & are by themselves incapacitating; I have seen several who complain of 'COVID brain,' are now unable to work, & need help managing their affairs. We all have a responsibility (to ourselves & to others) to do what we can to limit the spread of this highly transmissible virus. This should be a consensus held unanimously by all of our thought leaders. It is a shame that the US has allowed this issue to become politicized, leading to widespread misconceptions. Let's just all follow the science, please!
1	How soon can the availability of #COVID19 vaccine in our local pharmacy store can turn into reality?
0	After two mRNA Vaxxes and one booster, my wife passed out and had convulsions.  She survived that, but is diagnosed with Limbic Encephalitis. She has NO prior history of anything like that.
1	The vaccines are not 100% safe, but they are safer than covid, especially if you are overweight or have collateral morbidities.
1	Cautious Optimism.... Please please please yes yes yes
1	Let's take action and protect ourselves and our communities by getting vaccinated.
1	Vaccines worked so well that these people grew up... Vaccines cause anti vaxxers
1	Feeling lucky to have access to the vaccine. Let's all get it!
0	i get sick more often after that vaccine
0	Got my second dose of moderna yesterday and I’ve been on my death bed all day today. #moderna #vaccine
0	I hope the BBC will run a show featuring vaccine injured people and those who have lost loved ones. We love to hear their stories and they deserve to be heard. You can't pretend they don't exist and they are not conspiracy theorist!!
1	an unvaxxed french boy brought measels in a measles-free-for-5-years country and didnt get it himself. vaccinated people are less powerful carriers than unvaxxed because our cells destroy the virus while inside us way more efficiently and faster. go to med school if you want to play doctor. no one knew about it until he started having a rash a few days later and cases of measels appeared in the country. so fuck outta here with your "while on the toilet" reasearch and fake info.  unvaccinated people are a danger to EVERYONE. bet you have no.idea what is in a vaccine.
1	Get the vaccine so we can have an awesome 2021 concert season. I miss you all.
0	Wow. They are dangerous corporations.
0	For myself, one of the reasons I'm unvaccinated is BECAUSE I care about my health. Strangely enough I drive carefully for the very same reason
0	The last 36 months has been the greatest worldwide human experiment ever known to man.  And the manufacturers have NO LIABILITY.
0	Vaccinated and have had Covid twice. Keep pumping big Pharma Doc. You're doing God's work. Do you get dividens from Phizer?
0	I mean, you can’t do a long-term test in a year, right, as quickly as they got them out. For people like that, I was more concerned than myself, who have some sort of underlying health issue that they just can’t run a long-term effect on how this vaccine is going to affect a person with that health.
1	Phase 3 #clinicaltrials Trial of #COVAXIN by @BharatBiotech, shows 81% efficacy. Independent data safety & monitoring board evaluation, shows #vaccine is well-tolerated & efficacious against SARS-CoV-2 across a wide range of age groups & variants in the country #CovidVaccine
1	Seeing how vaccines have eradicated diseases like measles, I'm confident COVID-19 vaccines are doing the same. It's a no-brainer for me.
0	I'm just not taking a vaccine. If you are vaccinated then you won't be infected. Just let me die if that's what you are expecting.
0	Hi I just want to vent long story short my father got the covid vaccine and it all went downhill from there to the point where he developed ALS. Keep in mind he was a healthy man , didn't smoke, drink, eat unhealthy. Could be coincidence but idk just seems too correlated. I also work in a neurology facility and have had many pt come to me saying that they've been experiencing muscle weakness after getting the vaccine. Some of these patients are as young as in their early 20s! Sucks that some employers are still mandating this even after all the information that has come out
0	if YOU REALLY WANTED TO KNOW!! You’d do some REAL RESEARCH!! Instead of being spoon fed!! But you DON’T WANT THE TRUTH!! Why?? Because it’s too late for you!!
0	Nah I’m good, they already made us take 2 of them. I’ll just go outside like a normal person
1	South Africa has 20% jab rate and mild infection ? who is lying to us.
0	I know about 12 people in my small town who dropped dead of heart attacks and blood clots after those shots , all under 55, how’s that for data .  My cousins kid got ALS right after getting that shot, poor kid, 32 and just got married. Had his whole life ahead of him. People you better wake up and start funding your courage and your voice
1	I work as a nurse and I worked with an old doctor who had polio. Although I applaud his dedication, I just feel bad for him. He is a cripple and regular tasks is daunting to him. If you weigh the risks and benefits, would you sacrifice having a few reactions over having life debilitating disease?
0	My grandma died if cancer shortly after getting vaxxed, and my cousin developed type 1 diabetes after hers.
0	Media reports seem to exaggerate the effectiveness of these vaccines, and there's not enough critical reporting on potential issues.
1	Vaccination is not just a personal choice; it's a responsibility to the community. Achieving herd immunity is crucial for protecting vulnerable populations who cannot receive vaccines.
1	Quickest way to get rid of a Republican I’d say.
0	"Shots shots shots shots shots... Everybody" Lil Jon
0	I’m not an anti-vaxxer or whatever you call it, but I just don’t know enough about this one, it’s so new and makes my anxiety sky rocket
1	No more anti vaccine nonsense. Roll your sleeves up and stop whining. Time to come out of our hibernation. Happy days
1	Not getting your child's vaccines should be illegal. I'm not joking
0	I’d never let  my kids take this poison.
0	Spoiler alert: There was never anything to vaccinate against.
1	As a healthcare worker, I’ve seen the effects of COVID-19 up close. The vaccine is a crucial tool in this fight.
0	THANK GOD I DID NOT GET THE VACCINE
0	By not taking the jab, I'm 100% safe from side effects and 99% safe from covid.
1	Long term effects of covid suck, please get the vaccine.
1	The CDC has reported that vaccinations make you anywhere from 10x-2x less likely to be infected, depending on prevailing variant.
1	I will forever be grateful for medical advancement and vaccines
1	I really don't believe your claim about running a lab if you can't even understand the term "reduce". You cannot be a scientist  Vaccines reduce the chances of catching Covid, and if you do catch it the vaccines reduce your chance of serious illness, long Covid or death
0	I don't trust the government pushing these vaccines. It feels like a way to control us.
1	SIDE EFFECTS way less severe than the side effects from COVID.
0	All Vaccines are dangerous, not just the Sar-Cov-2 Covid, Corona vaccines. Myocarditis and Pericarditis, heart attacks, multisystem inflammatory syndrome, and sudden healthy person death syndrome After Pfizer/BioNTech, Janssen, Novavax, Moderna mRNA COVID-19 Vaccinations; healthy people dying. Avoid the demon venom vax shot, and do a total body detox. Peace, Love Jesus.
0	I only know of people who are getting sick or dead who actually take the vaccine or get their "test"
0	This has been a crime against humanity on a global scale.
0	There are no more experts in medicine.
1	Got my first Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine on Saturday. Can’t wait to get second dose.
1	I had my first dose of Pfizer on the 11th of August, with no soreness in the arm nor bruising. During the night I did have however pains on my left side and underneath the arm pit, after two days it went away.
0	I have never been vaccinated and I have never had any diseases that vaccines are made to prevent. I don’t have any regrets and I am in excellent health.
0	You killed your own children! You sacrificed them to Molech and now you want pity? Go ask God for forgiveness! I am out of it for you, scum!!!
0	I had so many family members try to tell me that I was reason that COVID persisted because of not getting vaccinated. They are not saying that now.
0	This article is riddled with problematic information. People believe what they do about covid vaccines because they were lied to, people were told it would prevent covid, it would save your loved ones, it would stop the pandemic, it was completely safe.. All of those things are untrue. It doesn’t prevent covid unless maybe you get a new booster every 3-6 months. It doesn’t prevent you from transmitting to others. Plenty of people who are vaccinated many times over have still been hospitalized and/or died of covid. The spread of covid is no better off because of the vaccines. There ARE risks of getting these vaccines, particularly if you get them repeatedly, which has been fully studied and acknowledged by nearly every scientific and government entity outside of the us government. Are they all wrong? Maybe that’s why people don’t continue to take these vaccine boosters, is because they were lied to repeatedly.
0	Has anybody looked at any of the info on all the things happening to people who have had the “vaccines?” My husband refuses to get it. I will NOT be getting any boosters!
1	"The COVID-19 vaccine also can cure sexually transmitted diseases."
0	Having personally known multiple j@bbed suffer strokes, heart attacks, cancer, tinnitus, menstrual issues, personality changes & 5 now in coffins, whereas non of my non-j@bbed family or friends have had any of these or are in coffins - I and my family are soooo glad we refused to buckle under the immense pressure.
1	I had my first AstraZeneca jab a week ago and appear to be still alive. My arm at the site of the injection got a tiny bit sore and thats all. Also I might mention I`m not a very fit person with a bunch of health problems.
1	Every adverse event related to vaccination either showed up immediately (in less than a year, like the 1999 rotavirus vaccine), or happened because of improper procedures in manufacturing or storage. (1955 cutter incident)  Any possible side effects for COVID-19 vaccine would have showed up in phase 3 trials, and have been continuously monitorerd in VAERS for the past year.  Why are you so hellbent in theorizing in an impossible long term side effect, when it's not based in any current or historical science? What are you basing your faith and belief in? Why are you so confident in peddling your misunderstanding of science to others?  You're 1000% confident in something you're 100% wrong about. It really shows how dangerously ignorant you are.
1	I support Trump, but we need prep USA We have vaccine for the flu, 170 Mill vaccinated, still 49 Million people got it last year &; 61,000 died. Without vaccine, if 100 Million get Covid19, 20 Million would get critically ill &; 2 Million would die at the current 2% fatality rate
1	The kid getting covid without the vaccine is far worse than if they get it after the vaccine. All the side effects of getting covid are worse than the known side effects of the vaccine.
1	I remember telling my dad the science of how vaccines worked way back when the pandemic first hit bc his Doc told him he needed the Shingles shot. He's very Republican, but I think he got the COVID shot bc I told him the science before the news cycle really started to vilify it. Sadly, he's super wary of all vaccines now. I can only hope this situation doesn't devolve into something worse.
0	My beautiful sister 55 passed within 24 hours of having her first vax . Massive heart attack .I will never get justice for her it makes me physically sick x
1	They applied for emergency approval today!!! I'm so excited!!!!!
1	If you aren’t vaccinated let’s keep our friendship on the phone. Don’t come to my house or anywhere near me
0	I've heard of cases where the vaccine caused more harm than good.

1	For immigrating students to US, UK etc should get either one depending on the zone you'll be visiting a new country which has new viruses. You may not get in contact but if you do it's better safe than sorry.
0	I am genuinely more hesitant now than ever before, and with a baby on the way, I am seriously questioning all the jabs they give to new borns.
1	What about publishing scientific data regarding the vaccine's efficiency and usefulness? There was a flow of public data during the first 18 months of the vaccine. Now there's only silence.
1	You sound like someone with no control of their own life trying to find stability & superiority in gotcha! conspiracy theories.  No vaccine in the last 200 years has ever had side effects show up years later. Your sideways thinking is not compatible with the scientific understanding of vaccines.  It’s like being afraid of turning on a car from the dealership because there’s a chance the engine could explode and kill you. The mechanics would just laugh.
1	I've had the vaccine and 2 boosters  haven't got COVID that I know of and still kicking.
0	I’m blown away by how easily the mass majority has been brainwashed into believing all of the garbage that’s fed to us about Covid. And yah, the incentives to get the vaxx... like how is it not obvious to people? When has there ever been a requirement to carry proof of something medical and personal? It’s terrifying
1	Keep your family healthy: Vaccinate against COVID-19. Protect infants and older adults from hospitalization. Take action now at http://vaccines.gov.
1	none of the ingredients are linked to issues unless you have allergies or sensitivities to such ingredients or other allergy issue. That’s why if you have any questions  or concerns about the vaccine and it’s reaction to YOUR body you ask YOUR primary doctor. And your not suppose to get certain vaccine with allergies. A lot people seem to miS understand that. Basic chemistry and biology should explain to who vaccines work, and how different chemically compounded bonds work together. YOUR doctor like most should recommend it and doctors “ did approve,” the need to show me scientific lab base evidence that is not debunked. Most of those doctors and nurses speaking don’t even have a degree in Virology, or immunization. A lot of them also bring political views into it.
1	"I have both doses of this vaccine, and I had no adverse effects. However, I want to emphasize that I have always been healthy, leading a healthy lifestyle with good nutrition and no underlying health conditions."

1	Vaccination is a powerful tool against COVID-19. Get informed and get vaccinated!
0	I dont need hard sell tactics. I just want available statistics, and if they don't know, DON'T GUESS!
1	Obligatory, am a frontline healthcare work. I actually graduated with my BSN-RN in nursing during the pandemic and I am so excited for the vaccine. All I know of working as a nurse is during a freaking pandemic. I work with immunosuppressed (easily sick) pts on a pulmonary (lung) floor. Basically, the people who need the vaccine the most. I know it'll be a long time till things go back to normal but this is a big step forwards in a year full of steps back.
1	Science doesn't care about your feelings. It cares about facts. And the fact is, vaccines save lives
0	The vaccine will save lives, depending on your definition of "the", your definition of "vaccine", your definition of "save", and your definition of "lives".
0	Studying vaccine development prior to the COVID outbreak gave me all the information I needed to refuse the new vaccines.
1	I am pro vaccine and vaccinated.
0	I ain't taking the vaccine even if it cost me my job
1	next week I'm getting vaccinated, and again two weeks later. It's a vaccine trial, so it's not guaranteed to be completely safe or effective, but there's a good chance that it will be, and the results from the trial will definitely help others.
1	My answer is also yes. I am leaping at the chance to get this vaccine.
1	I am so thankful for everyone who was a part of developing the vaccines, and everyone who took their time to test me and my coworkers at the neurological rehabilitation hospital I work at, so that there was less chance of our patients getting sick. I've b
0	Fire them and jail immediately. So called politicians are out of sudden medical experts? Give us a break. A banker knows everything about vaccines? Stop that madness.
1	If you are concerned about the risk myocarditis from vaccines, you should be terrified about the risk of myocarditis from COVID.
1	Did people actually think we wouldn’t beat it
0	This aged so well. Even my elderly parents are like “no more vaccines”. They blew all the belief in the medical establishment in 2 years…
1	Small shot, big impact. Stay safe, get vaccinated
1	Nurses are excellent advocates for vaccines. If you’re a nurse, don’t be afraid to speak up!
0	Do we actually need this rushed vaccine for a virus which has 99.99% survival rate! Think about it !
0	f it doesn't affect the body, why did I have chills and fever for two days each time? It's all a big lie. By the time it's figured out, we'll all be able to be remote controlled.
0	MSM now admits the Covid shots are toxic. The masses are going to be severely pissed off when they finally find out what they've injected themselves with numerous times.
0	My heart bleeds for all the people who took the jab. Because they were frightened scared or coerced into it. That they would loose their jobs homes unable to feed their children. It's not right to say I told u so etc. These people trusted and believed what they were told. They are the innocents. Gov etc are evil. And I hope their is justice for the people injured and lost their lives. May their souls rest in peace
0	I never wanted the vax, fought it for so long.
0	I'm so glad I said a great big no from the start. I've never had a single jab, and I feel absolutely fine I'm my 60's.
0	Lol at Phizer now claiming you need a third shot to get 5 to 10 times more efficacy rate then before after half a year.
1	I’m a teacher. I can’t wait until I can get a vaccine and hopefully get my students all back in person again
1	I received my COVID-19 vaccine today, and I feel a sense of relief and empowerment. Grateful for the opportunity to contribute to the collective effort to end the pandemic.
1	Happy to receive 1st dose of #PfizerBioNTech vaccine! Thanks to my Uni @Unicatt that quickly offered the vaccination
1	My happiest moment of 2020: my Wife texting me that she’s been vaccinated. Up yours, Covid! #PfizerBioNTech #Adios2020 #WearAMask #VaccinesWork
1	It must be UNDERSTOOD that INFECTION simply means having the PATHOGEN (Disease-causing microbe) into one's body. No VACCINE  nor any other TREATMENTS can stop one from being INFECTED. But an effective VACCINE will prepare your body's IMMUNE system to defend you against illness.
1	It’s over. Life continues. Just survive until they are available. Good news after good news is calming
0	The only thing to know is that I will never take this poison.
1	I am beyond relieved to share that I’ll be among the first to receive the #CovidVaccine from #PfizerBioNTech.
1	There still appears to be bifurcated outcomes by vaccination status, unvaccinated rates being roughly 10x vaccinated for adverse outcomes
1	Parents who opt out of vaccinations should opt out of Public school. A parent has a right to a safe school environment for their children and children that are unvaccinated pose a threat. Since schools are funded by both State and Federal Governments those people who don’t believe in government vaccine protocols shouldn’t go to public schools. A parents rights end when it puts other children at risk.
0	That is what our immune systems are for.
0	I know someone who died recently from a blood clot and she took the shot a month or so before. I would like to see an investigation into the soldier that recently got the shot and caught covid the next day, dying 3 weeks later. Seems too coincidental that he caught covid one day after getting the shot.
0	What you need to know is, say no to shots
0	I keep hearing this seatbelt scenario. A seatbelt can be taken on and off...A Vax  can't be taken out of your body once put in.
1	Define "young". If you mean teens and twenties, coronary artery disease is extremely rare, almost nonexistent, but becomes increasingly common with age. If you are talking about myocarditis, an inflammation of the heart muscle, then yes there is data. This is more common in people under 50. Note that myocarditis from Covid is more common than myocarditis from Covid vaccines. It generally resolves with rest and anti-inflammatory medicine like ibuprofen.
1	I will be getting this new shot once its available!
1	I am past 75, with no health issues. I was twice vaccinated and once boosted when I got a very mild case of Covid. I had to wait to get my second booster three months after I tested negative (which was one week after my positive test.) I will take every booster that's available and a once yearly shot when that becomes the norm. I didn't sacrifice for 2+ years to take chances.
1	So, today is vacation day. Science at its best. Big thank you to everyone at #theyoungerbuilding, @scotgov @NHSNSS and all the volunteers. #COVID19 #mRNA #Moderna
0	Losing my job was a price well worth paying to not have fallen victim to those monsters and their poison.
0	Haven't taken a single shot....and going strong!
0	Took my first one in 2021 due to peer pressure and 30 minutes later lost 70% of the use of my right arm for a year (not to mention sersiously ill for 6 days after). Searing pain if I moved it too much. Not taken any more since. I can see why all the athletes din't want to risk them. Junk.
0	Iâ€™ve had covid a total of 5 times, and I suspect a 6th. Iâ€™m 24 years old and in great health as far as I know. I have tested positive for covid on 4 isolated occasions and had textbook symptoms the other 2 times. Despite this, people continue to tell me itâ€™s impossible to get covid that many times. When the vaccines came out, I was reluctant, and finally bit the bullet and got the J&J 1 shot. The 2 cases of covid I had post vaccine were the worst by far. Had problems breathing just standing up. Iâ€™ve also had other issues that persist to this day like higher than normal blood pressure, increased resting heart rate at any given time, out of breath going up stairs despite being able to bike 20+ miles at a time. Just a bunch of weird shit. And what I find funniest is that the same people that â€œguessedâ€ you canâ€™t have covid that many times, are also â€œguessingâ€ that the vaccine is totally safe, despite the former being known longer. But only time will tell.
1	This is scary but hopeful that the scientists will come up with a vaccine soon. I guess the best way to protect ourselves from viruses like #COVID19 is to eat healthy and exercise so our healthy cells and immune system can protect us from viruses like #coronavirus
1	i get my second dose on the 23rd lets goooooooooooo
0	the PM should show his vaccine cards as proof that he fully trusts them
0	imma wake up with a third leg or something
0	Keep your experimental drug
1	Seriously, folks, vaccines save lives. It's not rocket science; it's just common sense.
0	The vaccine is toxic and unsafe.
1	I completely support vaccinations, have seen Covid and believe wholeheartedly in a scientific approach to healthcare.
1	Today one of my patients decided to get their first COVID vaccine and begin Gardasil series Yay for preventive medicine
1	Why are so many people against media and against vaccines? What have you read about vaccines, and where have you read it? Do you get your malaria, yellow fever etc shots when you head to countries that need them? Do you get a tetanus shot when required? Did your parents have you vaccinated when you were younger (and if you’re a parent, have you had your kids’ standard vaccines done)?
1	I’m shocked by how cheap they all are!!! If only that could be with all medicine!
0	Risks you say? Well when businesses were mandating it for people to work without them knowing the risks. I'm just so grateful that I never took the vaccine even though I lost my 20 year career at a hospital. I'm still alive. Had covid 14 months ago . No problem. My symptoms were less than my friends that are vaccinated.
1	I'm a teacher, and I know that schools can be breeding grounds for viruses. That's why I got vaccinated to protect my students and their families.
0	need more case studies on various vaccines and type of virus in specific area of infections. compare th to natural immunity.
0	My sister in law had several strokes after her first booster. She was the healthier member of our family and in her early 50’s. She said she had felt different after the shots. I’m grateful I never got vaccinated. Bummed that two of my kids did get vaccinated 🙏
1	This is fantastic engineering work. Way to go, biotechnology.
1	Happy for you! My friend in Portugal is still awaiting his first shot. I hope your arm isn’t too sore, the only symptoms I had is a slightly sore arm and being pretty tired for a day
1	Freedom of choice isn't freedom from consequence.
0	Missouri here....I listen and trust Dr. FAUCI.  Fully vaccinated in April.  My deepest respect and gratitude to you,  sir.
1	Today we got our updated COVID boosters. Now we are all ready for the Welcome to Night Vale, the winter SF convention circuit and indoor music season. Be sure to get yours too!
1	Team Vaccine! Got the shot, feeling protected
1	get your vaccine
0	Enjoy Covid.... so lucky you got that 'life saving vaccine' ... honestly you can shut up about how getting vaccinated will keep us from getting Covid. LOL
0	Russia sold SputnikV vaccines to Slovakia which are different from vaccines used for lancet study, says State Institute for Drug Control after tests. Russia lied to us and SputnikV is just a propaganda and tool of hybrid warfare. Don't trust Russia. #vaccination #scam
1	Vaccines are a critical component of disaster preparedness and response.
1	Let's hear it for vaccines – the rockstars of preventive healthcare.
0	My mom doesn't want to give the vaccine to me because she's worried about the long term affects.
1	I had the Pfizer vaccine, and I did have a slight fever and fatigue after the second dose, but other than that, everything went fine
0	This is a pro BIG PHARMA video promotional material .
0	I personally know of four that died after their first jab. Two others now have rare cancers after their jabs. Must be climate change!
1	This is a great news! Hopefully a treatment and vaccine for COVID19 will be on its way faster than ever before for a new disease.
1	I want Covid to stop killing people. I want our society to come together and defeat this. I want the nation healed. The vaccine is awesome, and it's working.
1	The fact that we have to create herd immunity to protect the conspiracy theorists in this comment section 🥴 covid is real yall
0	So glad i didn't get that jab...
1	Got my first dosage today too
0	I was pro vaccine back when this whole pandemic felt brand new because at the time i thought that a vaccine would "save us" but  i would say that I'm more enlightened now than ever before. I got vaccinated and regretted it as soon as i took it because i wasn't the same ever since. Like most people i got brain fog, vision issues, head pressures and hallucinations with it and before i got the vaccine i was perfectly healthy. The vaccine also gave me my first ever panic attack too. I am not even kidding. The week i got the vaccine a lot of bad things happened to me and i wasnt the same human ever again. Still dealing with the side effects even to this VERY day.
1	I’ve got 2 shots and 2 boosters and I’m still alive along with my Sister, niece, nephew, wife, MIL, BIL friends and cousins. We still healthy and alive.
1	Actually you do. It's basic statistics.   The stat used in the bridge analogy would not be comparing deaths caused by the bridge to the world population. My risk of death caused by the bridge is zero because I don't live near or cross the bridge. My risk of death *due to not being vaccinated* is also zero because I'm vaccinated. I do not belong in either population statistic, yours or OP's. You can't use the world population in your risk assessment, only those at risk.   And to clarify, because I know you'll want to jump on it, I did not say my risk of death due to a vaccine-preventable disease is zero, I said my risk due to not being vaccinated is zero. I could also be killed on a different bridge, but not the one pictured, so my risk relative to that bridge is zero.   The logic in the OP (the bridge isn't perfectly safe so we're better off without it) is flawed, but it's intentionally flawed to match the logic of antivaxers (vaccines aren't perfectly safe so we're better off without them).  Edit to add, the commenter who initially responded to you used it correctly, they specifically referenced the unvaccinated population.
1	god blessed america with covid vax
1	Thank you for vaccines. The covid vaccine saved many lives. The only persons who died were unvaccinated. FACT..There were 1,100,000 deaths in America from COVID-19. Canada had 30,000 deaths. Facts are stranger than fiction sometimes.
0	Delayed injection site reactions (redness, swelling, and pain at the injection site that can start a week or more after the vaccination)
0	We live our lives completely fine without needles of filth. Stay on your knees and keep sucking pharmas dikc
0	Thank GOD I didn’t get jabbed. Feel terrible for all the trusting individuals who thought they were doing the responsible thing. So sad
1	Can't these people just admit they are scared of needles
1	Had first shot Tuesday the 12th, Moderna. Uneventful, no detected reactions. I wanted super powers.
0	I have Myocardises after getting my MRNA. Just waiting now for a law firm to start a class action. They lied to us.
0	Vaccine works for short period of time how many times people have to get vaccinated ? It is not a cure, our body's immune system is cure.
0	The best decision I ever made in my life was to not get that jab. Healthy and happy 3 years later, while a number of family and friends were not so lucky after getting bullied into getting it. It's anything but rare.
0	We lost my brother n law November 2021 and father n law Jan 2022. Both vaccinated!! Both died of heart issues
1	I'm getting my flu and covid shots in the next couple weeks.
1	I feel lucky that I was able to get the vaccine and I urge everyone to do the same, whenever you can.
0	Anaphylaxis (a severe allergic reaction, very rare)
1	I have gotten AZ vaccine last few weeks. I was quite sick to be honest including high fever up to 39 C but recovered after 24 hours.
0	I will be so relieved when my 2 1/2 year old grandson can be vaccinated. We are all so fortunate to live in a time, where such effective vaccines can be produced.
0	How's those jabs working for ya
0	Biggest mistake of my life was taking the shot to get my wife out of lockdown. 2 years later and I still have heart problems and thrombosis in my legs. F the entire medical mafia.
1	Science and evidence support the effectiveness of vaccines in preventing illness.
1	Let's all get vaccinated and beat this together! #VaccineJoy
0	"This recommendation was based on extensive data and clinical trials." And she wants our trust???
0	Happened to hundreds of thousands of people around the world. Friends of my family. Husband and wife are dead, no more than 3 hours apart after their jab. Friends ended up in hospital with heart conditions Friends now have brain tumors and seizures All perfectly healthy before the jab.
1	COVID jab done
0	I didn't get the vaccine, so I have no worries about side effects on me. I do however worry about my loved ones who did. Their safety means everything to me. We knew before the vaccines there would be risks, just not how bad
0	it is proven beyond all doubt that the covid "vaccine" raises igG4 antibodies This leads to fibrosis and the development of turbo cancers.
1	It’s crazy that after all we have been through that we have to promote the vaccine on a damn coffee cup. People are stubborn and stupid.
1	I will weigh the potential long term effects of covid vs the long term effects of the vaccine and decide which risk I want. I’m pretty sure I’ll get the vaccine unless I learn something that changes my mind by the time it becomes available.
1	Long term effects of covid suck, please get the vaccine.
1	Kudos to the healthcare workers administering the vaccines! Their dedication and hard work deserve our respect and gratitude.
0	As soon as they started coercing people to take this threatening mandates ect then you knew something was fishy.
0	To all those who criticized me from 2020 to 2022 about refusing to be vaccinated: Do you now understand why my worries were justified?! All the naysayers and critics were mocked and silenced by the mainstream media. But the truth can't be ignored forever!
1	Why not just force the kids to have vaccines and jail the parents if they don't? Anti-vaxxing seems more dangerous than drunk driving.
1	"I don't want a poison in my body" but stuff themselves full of fast food. Crazy.
0	Even if I die, i will never regret NOT getting the shots
0	saying "safe" isn't enough, either explain it demonstrate otherwise
1	The vaccine process was smooth and well-organized. Kudos to the staff!
1	Vaccine's a miracle. We're living in the future, people.
1	With the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, we now have a third safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine being administered across the country. I’m grateful these folks are stepping up and getting vaccinated
0	The best thing to do is have a strong immune system and avoid vaccines as much as possible.There will  always be an improvement in vaccine..we dont know what kind of anti bodies it would create.
0	Dang look at all these bots saying “vaccines” are good, haha
1	Received Moderna Omicron yesterday AM..Some fever and a slightly"foggy" mind with minor aches. All cleared up an hour ago after a morning nap....Flu shot on my calendar for late September.
1	Some people would never accept this as they were brainwashed into taking it,  really sad.
0	As a nurse, I witnessed my coworkers have significant adverse effects and then be met with stone silence by the medical establishment. That was enough to make me not want to take it.
0	Yes but how many people die from preventable diseases they could have stopped without vaccines?
1	Vaxxed and proud.
1	Some folks worry the vaccine won't last forever, but that's normal. Most vaccines need a top-up. It's all part of keeping immunity up!
1	vaccine save the people life
0	Thinking about hiring a team of personal bodyguards to fend off any potential virus attacks
0	lot of people in our area died after vaccination against covid, including those relatively young under 50 years old
1	Don't people also have the right not to be exposed to a lethal virus because someone didn't want to get a shot? Or to refuse people who could be carrying it into their business? It seems like "individual freedoms" only ever matters when it affects these people directly
1	I’m a teacher. I can’t wait until I can get a vaccine and hopefully get my students all back in person again
1	the vaccination works as intended. It reduces hospitalizations and mortality.
0	there are more side effects that those. a coworker had the second shot and got vomiting diarrhea, back pain, chills , fever he got very bad..
0	Worried about potential side effects, especially since there's no way to predict how each individual's body will react.
0	With that vaccine you'll get nano tech in your body
1	I am not an anti-vaxxer by any means. I understand the importance of vaccines and heard immunity. But I am concerned about the speed they are trying to get a Covid vaccine out. Many of these ventures seem to be trying to skip steps (like phases of testing) or hurry the infection rate along. On top of that, we still don't know how long someone is immune from this virus, either after catching covid or via any possible vaccine.
1	Nobody is "pro vax". They just have common sense and a basic understanding of science.
0	Just received my first dose of the experimental vaccine. Dictactor Dan you’re a Fkn vile piece of human excrement.
1	so like I literally just wanna say that at least in my state if u get the vaccine u can do wutever u want so that’s why I got it
0	By not taking the jab, I'm 100% safe from side effects and 99% safe from covid.
1	How are conservatives so agressively progov until it benefits literally anyone but themselves?
1	getting vaccinated is a small act that makes a big difference
0	If the Rona was anything to worry about MILLIONS would already be dead. Everyone on planet earth already had this common cold that was used and abused by new world order to control and take rights away and destroy the middle class
0	The doctor does not have to justify why she hasn't had a vaccine to anyone...and neither do I!
0	Covid is just a normal flu. Normal flu shot works just as well. So one would wonder why still pushing the experimental shot?
1	Canada actually already received a BUNCH of the Pfizer vaccines. Canada bought enough for the entire population through both Pfizer and moderna
0	Stay away from the poison
1	Covid19 is no joke. It kills relentlessly and without care for your politics or masking or vaccination hesitations. It kills people who don't vaccinate or mask more efficiently. And right now, white GOPers are the ones who are getting sickest and dying from covid at higher rates
0	I love how people who just want to live a normal life without getting random needles stuck in them without knowing of the long term side effects are now being labeled "sceptics"
1	Poor BioNTech who actually made the vaccine, but gets no credit
0	By not taking the shots I am 100% safe from adverse reactions and 99.98% safe from Covid
1	Weren't we all supposed to have died from the first doses we received? Has the goal post moved again for our death dates?
0	If you valued your life you would not take experimental drugs.
0	There's not enough data on how the vaccine affects pregnant women.
0	I’m not getting that shit either I’m good lol
0	Proud to be Unvaccinated.
1	I got vaccinated because I want to do my part in this global effort.
1	Oh, stop the hysteria already ffs the vaccine helps
0	Talk about any possible short/mid/long term effects ? Oh you can’t can you because the trial only started 2 months before roll out so you have no idea whatsoever
1	I got my second booster in Dec, tried to talk my 70 year old coworker into getting it (she had the first two shots) but she didn't want to. Well guess what...she got Covid and is home sick as a dog. Oh well.
1	But I thought that it was these "experimental" vaccines that were going to kill us! I'm so confused! I guess all the deaths from the vaccine will kick in any day now....
1	So so Happy to receive the Moderna Covid-19 Vaccine today in Milan, ILLinois!! I come back in 28 days for my Booster! #CovidVax #CovidVaccine #Moderna #VaccinesWork #ScienceRocks

0	I'm concerned about the potential long-term effects of the mRNA technology used in these vaccines.
0	Imagine a product so awful that you have to lobby for tyrannical laws just so ppl will buy it.
0	Brother got the shot, dead a month later
1	That is excellent. One shot is awesome because we can easily mass vaccinate. The only way to beat this is by getting shots in arms ASAP
1	"The vaccine not only protects me but also contributes to the well-being of my community. It's a win-win."
0	Seems suspicious that the same people pushing vaccines also profit from selling drugs to treat illnesses caused by those very vaccines
0	No vaccine, no mask, no worries. Worked through it all. I just refuse to be a scared lil' beotch. You want scary? Swim Olongopo river. Swim ANY river in eastern asia. I survived. Quit being such a bunch of woosies.
0	I've heard about changes to menstrual cycles following vaccination, which is concerning. What research is being done on this?
0	Nobody regrets not getting the jab.
1	immune by taking vaccine
0	If these vaccines are so safe why is the FDA and these companies who make these vaccines protected from any lawsuits and liability for 2 years?  If any company is not held accountable for their products then I don't want it.
0	"It wasn't a scam. It was a genocide."
0	Sure, if you believe doctors.
1	It does lower transmission by about 80%.
0	I believe in natural immunity over vaccination. I think our bodies can handle the virus on their own.
1	Witnessing misinformation spread about vaccines can be disheartening vaccines saves lives
1	Longing for normalcy, vaccinated to reclaim life, embracing activities.
0	I feel like there's a lot of pressure to get vaccinated. It should be a personal choice, not something you're judged for.
0	They would have to hunt me down, fight me, and restrain me, to get that stuff pumped in my body.
1	One person dies because of a vaccine. Millions die because they they aren't vaccinated. Our lives depend on the common good.
0	The more desperate they get to get mRNA into all of us the more desperate I get to run a million miles!
0	Why no one is talking about potential long-term side effects
0	I had blood work (routine) the day after my 3rd shot.  My liver enzymes shot way up.  Doctor was concerned because that test is always stable for me.  I then was tested for hepatitis and was negative.  No more shots for me
1	No one has ever said get the vaccine and you won’t get COVID. It’s just like the flu shot. You won’t get it serious.
0	Get your shots, cattle!
1	Moderna ftw baby
0	I'm not taking this jab! The blood of the lamb is my antitode against corona viruses!
1	We need to get vaccinated for our own good and for the good of others
1	If you’re vaccinated, you’re safe, from getting harassed by a group of complete sheep morons.
1	This is what is going to happen, anti vaccers are gonna get COVID and not be vaccinated and regret it
1	Anti vaxxers are a problem, but they are a self sorting problem
1	Does this mean we are getting closer to a safe vaccine?
1	Benefit: your odds of surviving increase
0	I have it on good authority from an Iranian cleric that this vaccine causes people to "become homosexuals"
1	Fantastic. There should be no excuse for not getting one unless a person is medically unable to. The longer people wait, the longer the restrictions last. Let's let the vaccines get our lives back!
1	My son who is in the military told my how many shots they get.  No sympathy for members of the military who refuse the vaccine.
1	Thank you so much for creating this video which I'm about to share on Facebook. It's so refreshing to see so much common sense packed into just a few minutes. This video could save the lives of many and prevent many others from suffering the debilitating long term effects of covid-19.
0	How can it be rare when EVERYONE that I know who took the jab suffered or is suffering side effects?
0	MSM Propaganda Machine: Hospitals facing Covid related staffing issues. TRUTH: Hospitals facing Covid related staffing issues because of so many medical staff terminations for refusing vaccination.
0	i think there is a good possibility that the corona virus has different strains already .just using one type of vaccine for one strain, may not be enough.
0	I am against covid testing, all covid “vaccines” aka globalist genocide jabs, paxlovid, molnupiravir, monoclonal antibodies and remdesivir. Covid was built on lies.
1	they will just move the goal post if you seem to be fine. I just got fully vaccinated but now it’s oh you will die in a couple months or years????
1	I'm scheduled to get my first dose on Monday. I'm doing my part.
0	Just to make sure you remain on MSM"s good favors !
0	The idea of vaccine mandates infringes on individual freedom and choice.
0	I refused to take the shots. I thought the way in which they kept pushing it was highly suspect. I kept getting phone calls from my GP and text messages asking why I hadn't taken it.  I was never an anti-vaxxer, up until this drama unfolded. Now I wouldn't take one ever again.
0	I've had 2 covid vaccines, and I've been suffering from more infections and ill health than my previous record of 15 years with only 2 - 3 days off work due to sickness. I've spoken to many people, and the consensus is that they do feel their health has deteriorated significantly AFTER the covid vaccines. I wish I didn't follow the bandwagon and media regarding the scaremongering of covid and should have stayed firm and avoided the vaccines altogether...
0	This is the first time in history where people are more scared of the vaccine than the actual virus...
0	You employers, vaccine companies, and governmental agencies that forced people to get these experimental mRNA injections, you’re going to pay. I promise.
0	Even if the vaccines were a "scam," I'm still happy I got them. I'd rather get an unnecessary but safe vaccine in the name of helping out my fellow humans than avoid trying to help myself and others in the name of some kind of rugged individuality because I thought I would be more unique if I didn't.
0	Never got the vaccine and I didnt wear face diapers lol
1	Saying that we need to wait for 5-10 or more years of covid vaccine data before it should get approval is an unnecessarily long time given how we have a statistical understanding of how the immune system works in most people. Scientists & doctors try to be reasonable and ethical
1	All pharmaceutical products come with potential downfalls. People should be given accurate information on all the possible negative side effects from these pharmaceutical products so that they can make an informed decision
0	I'm waiting to see long-term effects. Unlike MMR, COVID vaccines were developed rapidly, and that worries me.
1	""The government is trying to give grandparents Autism, wake up sheeple!!!" -My aunts FB tonight probably
0	The next time MAGAs need surgery, or any type of medical aid, they should avoid going to a doctor. Instead, they should go to Dr Trump for all of their medical needs.
0	The vaccines are really good at promoting health. The financial health of large pharmaceutical companies.
1	I experienced problems beyond the couple of side effects from the vaccine that are long gone now and it’s been a few months. The peace in knowing there’s a barrier of protecting against the virus is so worth the initial anxiety of getting it
1	I ws given the MMR and Polio and DPT vaccines before I was old enough to be able to object, and because of those vaccines, I lived long enough to need COVID vaccinations.
1	Got both Pfizer shots. Absolutely NO complications!!!
0	After almost dying from the Moderna Covid shot on May 13, 2021, I don't understand how people can't see that the government is trying to kill us.
0	One point that could have been made --- who pays for vaccine development determines how quickly it's made.     When a drug company develops a vaccine, it is betting its own money that the vaccine will work.    Therefore, testing is done slowly and cautiously, as a failure at any point means the loss of those funds up to that point.    No company will pour millions or even billions into doing all the development and testing simultaneously, but fortunately the government stepped in to pay for it, so no company attempting it would go bankrupt from a failure.   Little wonder it was called Operation Warp Speed.
0	I refused to take the shots. I thought the way in which they kept pushing it was highly suspect. I kept getting phone calls from my GP and text messages asking why I hadn't taken it.  I was never an anti-vaxxer, up until this drama unfolded. Now I wouldn't take one ever again.
0	I WILL NOT COMPLY.. Booster #4 incoming for the vaccinated. Good Luck I CHOOSE FREEDOM
1	Blaming vaccines because your child had a negative reaction to them is like blaming cheese for being lactose intolerant. It’s nobody’s fault. It’s the luck of the draw.
1	(I'm not anti-vaccine, please for the love of God get vaccinated, I just have an irrational fear of needles to the point where even thinking about it gives me panic attacks)
0	I am glad I watched this because it helped me realise that the shots are certainly unsafe.
0	2nd dose of #Moderna definitely fucked me up and i am only cursing bc i had to break my fast in order to have breakfast and take medicine? ms #Moderna will never let you catch her sleeping no ma’am. i am sorry for thinking i could skate on by with no consequences?
1	Trust in science and vaccines. They are our hope for a safer tomorrow.
0	I dont believe our immunity system needs syringes at all
0	The amount of relief I feel that I didn't get vaccinated, even though I was pressured by almost every member of my family, is absolutely indescribable! I feel sorry for those who got it though. Best of luck, they're definitely gonna need it.
1	It is genuinely remarkable how far modern medicine has come. The scientists involved in producing this and the people who volunteered to get injected should be held in the highest regard.
0	My mom got auto immune condition after vaccine of two doses. Our life has become hell.
0	HAHAHAHA.  Yup since I skipped all of the junk jabs my system took care of Covid in 21.  The oh so deadly delta, took about 4-5 days of not feeling great but it was fine.  Not a single thing since, feel great.  The natural immune system is a beautiful thing.  That is until you allow the stuff that turns your blood to cottage cheese to be injected into your body
1	I didn’t have any side effects at all with my 3 Pfizer shots. Getting the shingles vaccine was much worse.
0	The covid virus and the covid vaccine have been designed to lower the earth’s population. It’s called “AGENDA 21” and the covid pandemic broke out around 2019 and was supposed to lower the population by 2021, hence, . “AGENDA 21”.
0	I've heard numerous stories of severe side effects from the vaccine, which makes me hesitant to take the risk for myself.
1	I hope the vaccine work and we have are life back 😔😔😔😔😔
1	My 5th #COVID19 #vaccine #boosted #Moderna #mRNA   Hey #AntiVaxxer #AntiVax Tell me more about how I’m at risk #SuddenDeath  “#Bioengineer” Other than not drinking  in water.. Vaccines are the Greatest #Healthcare innovation in history.
0	Good example that the vaccine is not effective at all
1	The vaccine is more than a shot in the arm; it's a shot of hope for the world.
1	You're getting a lot of responses already, but this question bothers me a lot. In isolation, it can be argued that healthy people can make their own decision about getting a vaccine vs a virus. However, those arguments are irrelevant, because you and everyone else dont live in isolation (unless you live on an island by yourself). We live in a society with other people. So young people deciding a contagious virus that statistically won't affect them as much as others are making that decision selfishly, because they neglect to take others into consideration. İf they get the virus it only perpetuates it further and gives more opportunity to infect other people who may be far more susceptible to the virus. So getting a vaccine isn't just about protecting yourself- it's about protecting everyone you come into contact with, and everyone around them as well.
1	This is the only vaccine in history that has an "acceptable" death rate. The side effects in some are bizzare. Isnt it your job to have concern about this and not try to belittle people that do?
0	Smart girl for declining. The gaslighting around the C19 jabs is OFF THE CHARTS!!!
1	The last booster 12% of eligible took it so maby they didn't want to waste resources to get the word out. I care and am getting it I wish more people cared.
0	They said there were NO side effects, now they say there were limited side effects, what are they gonna say in the future? Lies, lies, lies…
0	This aged so well. Even my elderly parents are like “no more vaccines”. They blew all the belief in the medical establishment in 2 years…
0	Studying vaccine development prior to the COVID outbreak gave me all the information I needed to refuse the new vaccines. Best decision I ever made
0	Being a Guinea Pig has its consequences. Get a term life insurance policy to protect your family. Good luck.
0	Risks you say? Well when businesses were mandating it for people to work without them knowing the risks. I'm just so grateful that I never took the vaccine even though I lost my 20 year career at a hospital. I'm still alive. Had covid 14 months ago . No problem. My symptoms were less than my friends that are vaccinated.
1	Take your vaccine.
1	“But where’s the proof that bullet actually killed your friend? He could have died from a heart attack at the same moment he was shot in the heart.”
1	Being only 17, the main reason for which I chose to get vaccinated wasn’t to protect myself, but to protect those around me
1	Here in Thailand, we barely have any vaccines, people are desperate to get vaccinated, and less that 10% of us are vaccinated. It feels very unfair that Americans just shoo it away when so many of us would have it in a heartbeat.
1	I thought I was at risk due to medication allergies but after speaking to my doctor, she recommended the COVID-19 vaccine.  I got the Moderna one and fully vaccinated since March. I didn't have any major side effects and I'm still doing fine
1	I want everyone to get vaccinated. It is in the best interest of all of us. Vaccines safe lives. Vaccines allow us to retake life. Play them up, not down.
1	Awesome that you got your vaccine! I really need to get mine soon.
0	I’ll continue to wear a mask and protect myself that way, not chancing this vaccine
1	Excellent report. Continue to highlight people who are hospitalized and on respirators because of their obstinance relative to being vaccinated. Also, I read that when one is intubated, the patient has to be put into a medically induced coma. If that is true, that aspect should be heavily emphasized in reports; it's a scary reality that people should be aware of!
1	Get all those diseases in your youth and you acquire lifetime immunity.
1	I got the vaccine! So grateful to the scientists, doctors and nurses
0	If you got that bioweapon ur life is basically sealed. Please remember these channels saying these shots are good. We need to hold this guy accountable
0	Member when your kid got the polio vaccine and didn’t get polio? Now member when your kids got the COVID vaccine then got COVID 6 times?
1	Without a vaccine, the is a higher chance that you are a carrier and spreader, which directly impacts someone else’s life. Everybody needs the vaccine
0	AMERICANS ARE DYING,  AND TRUMP KEEPS LYING AND PLAYING GOLF!
1	"Vaccination is not just about personal protection; it's a civic duty to help end the pandemic and save lives."
1	Why are some people so against the vacc?
0	My kids are unvaccinated, aged 13 and 10, and I have zero regrets. ZERO.
1	Scientists have been working for many years, long before the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, to develop vaccines against coronaviruses. Knowledge gained through past research helped speed up development of the COVID-19 vaccines.
0	Never took vaccine before
0	I'm glad I didn't get that shyt
0	If the Media promotes it, avoid it.
1	Getting our kids fully vaccinated is the best way to protect them against COVID-19. Today, Dr. Fauci and I stopped by Kimball Elementary School to meet with families and kids getting their vaccines—and encourage more parents and kids to do the same.
0	So far science has been wrong. COVID is all about $$$ and demarcate control.
1	COVID-19 vaccines are highly effective in preventing the most severe outcomes from a COVID-19 infection
1	My own view from dealing with lots of COVID outbreaks this winter is that vaccination’s the real game changer
0	Studying vaccine development prior to the COVID outbreak gave me all the information I needed to refuse the new vaccines.
1	I had nothing at injection and felt slightly under the weather for a few days. I’ll sacrifice a few days to breathe easie
1	I just got mine yesterday, the J&J shot as well. I felt like a truck had hit me at about 2am, but that seems to have been the worst of it. Still getting some hot/cold flips but basically like the flu side effects for me overall. Super scared of needles as well, like my one big fear in life, so I definitely sympathize for everyone who doesn't like needles. Still folks, there's a reason stuff like Polio is history, because everyone got vaccinated. Please get vaccinated if for nothing else your friends and family.
0	I have several friends who I've known for 20+ years, so I know their history. As soon as they took the vaccine, their bodies went haywire. I didn't take it (and never will), and I'm just fine. The other 8 people I know who have had no health symptoms - all unvaccinated. Although some of the vaccinated people I know haven't had ill effects, it's about one per week now - who ends-up getting shingles, or needs ankle braces (a common side effect from the vaccine). I work at a medical clinic, so 'm thinking - I know a little bit more about this - than your average Joanne.
0	Risks you say? Well when businesses were mandating it for people to work without them knowing the risks. I'm just so grateful that I never took the vaccine even though I lost my 20 year career at a hospital. I'm still alive. Had covid 14 months ago . No problem. My symptoms were less than my friends that are vaccinated.
1	“I’m getting the COVID-19 vaccine, not only for me, but for my family, as well. It will be a peace of mind for my health, but also my grandparents’ and my parents’ health.
0	I had Modern a for 1st, 2nd and booster. No side effects after 1st shot, flu symptoms after 2nd shot that put me to bed for about 24 hours, and 12 hours after having booster I had chills, swets, nausea, feeling faint, thirst....it hit me like a ton of bricks.
1	You don’t get vaccinated for to protect yourself, you do it to protect your families and loved ones!
1	ACHIEVEMENT UNLOCKED! Vaxxed & Boosted(50g): Reached booster levels of Covid Vaccination against the Omicron Variant
1	I've had AZ vaccine. I'm 33 years old. Side effects were horrendous for 24 hours. Fever, headache, did not know what to do with myself! Second jab coming in may. No regrets.
1	If I were eligible for a vaccine heck yes I would take it! Unfortunately I only turn 16 this fall and even then I probably won't be able to get mine for another few months after that.
1	It's still my understanding. Symptom severity appears to be decreased in people who are vaccinated.
1	Took the plunge and got vaccinated. If it means protecting my family, it's worth it.
1	Exciting progress. Vaccines that address variants are crucial to ending this pandemic.
0	Funny how the unvaxed have no problems and vaxd ppl have clots, myocarditis, strokes, and a long list of other side effects going on.
1	For all practical purposes COVID is here to stay. It will become endemic one day or the other but will never go away. The only way to deal with it is to make mask, social distancing and vaccination along with hand washing integral part of life.
0	Misinformation by the CDC and WHO
0	If this is so safe - why aren’t the pharmaceutical companies held liable as other companies are, please explain why so many young healthy people are being buried ? Athletes in their dropping like stones.
0	I'll never understand why people are willingly putting this crap in their body knowing that the vaccine manufacturers carry no liability.
0	Never ever taking the poision. It's killed or maimed more poeple than the virus itself.
0	I wouldn't take it.
1	Vaccine trials and their data are easily misinterpreted by health care professionals if they haven't worked in drug development. The endpoint is risk REDUCTION, not elimination, comparing how many people in the active group contracted the disease to how many got sick in the placebo group. That difference is the risk reduction.
1	I even got the updated booster. I like having the peace of mind it brings.
0	My in-laws take the shots because they’re normies and fall for everything the news tells them. Their cognitive abilities have degraded considerably. I feel sorry for them.
0	100% safe from side effects, 99.98% safe from COVID death. I think I’ll stay unvaccinated. Let’s Go Brandon!
1	Got my pfizer vaccine today. Feeling good, just a little bit tired. Looking forward to putting COVID behind us.
0	Author John Beaudoin: “[Burying COVID vaccine deaths] is not just the intent to defraud… it’s also felony murder. A 12-year-old girl received four vaccines at once, including one for COVID. She died 26 days later from a stroke.
0	I am fine,  still not getting vaccine.
0	I wouldn't give the vaccine to the dog
1	Incredible video explaining some incredible technology! I'm amazed by the scientists that managed to come up with this technique and put it into effective use! Incredible stuff!
0	We all know it’s the Jabby. And these evil people push for it still… crazy
0	How you are saying "vaccine is very safe. Don't worry about it" without studying the short term(2 years) and long term(10-15 years) effects of vaccine on human body?
0	Sadly I took 2 doses..I regret , I don't feel anything but who knows. I will keep praying to Lord keep me safe and intact from any negative impact
1	WATCHING THIS AS WE WAIT IN LINE TO GET VACCINATED AT DODGERS STADIUM! LETS GO SCIENCE!
0	Does anyone have documentation on the reason the Covid-19 documents, Vaccines, and related information is being asked to bury them in government installation for 75 years!!!!!
1	I can't speak for everyone, but I know I will be getting the vaccine as soon as it is available.
0	These vaccines were rushed, and we don't know the long-term effects. I'll wait and see before getting jabbed.
1	I'm totally vaccinated I had no problem.
1	Great news. Wish more people would actually go get the shot(s)....
1	I'm so grateful for vaccines. And so glad that new techniques are making them more effective and faster to make!
1	They are safe
0	Don't worry there will be 20 boosters
0	I DONT WANT VACINE LITERDY LIKE 5-10 DOCTORS NEED TO HOLD ME TO NOT RUN AWAY AND I SCREAM SO LOUD
0	The pressure to get the COVID vaccine is too much. It should be a personal choice, not a mandate.
0	SHAMEFUL GOVERNMENT!!! GREED over human safety. Pretense and fear for control!
1	Just got my vaccine dose and I already feel safe
1	People not getting the vaccine are selfish. Think about your children!
1	My mom thinks Bill Gates invented the virus so he could sell everyone the vaccine. But she also doesn't believe the virus is real, but she also believes it's real just that it's no worse than the flu. But she also sees people are dying so she thinks Bill Gates is trying to kill everyone and only save the ones that let him put a chip in them with a vaccine. But she also thinks the death tolls are fake news spread by liberal media.
1	Vaccines save lives. Grateful for the healthcare workers making it happen. #SaveLives #HealthHeroes
1	it seems that vaccines give better protection than them.
1	Vaccination is supported by decades of scientific research and evidence.
0	I chose not to get vaccinated, worked around COVID patients, and never got infected. Colleagues who got vaccinated had varying degrees of illness. Coincidence?
1	Vaccine = getting life back on track. So for it.
1	The benefits outweigh the risks. All I want for Christmas is for everyone to be vaccinated so that COVID-22 doesn’t happen.
0	I disagree and I don't need to prove anything to you or anybody. Try and explain WHY, all the sudden, since these "vaccines" were essentially forced on people, in the last 2-3 years, that, otherwise healthy young people, a LOT of them athletes, in EXCELLENT shape, OTHER than having taken the shots, are having heart attacks, strokes, and other UNtypical medical problems for such persons. THAT is ALL I need to KNOW that these "vaccines" are a slow-acting POISON... You do you and I'll do me...
0	"The government and big pharma are pushing these vaccines for profit. I won't be a pawn in their game."
1	I'll take all the vaccines and boosters I can get my hands on to not risk more of that shit.
1	COVID is thinning the ranks of republican voters.
0	The seasonal flu has so far killed more Americans than #coronavirus #COVID19 Has worldwide, there’s an effective vaccine, that saves lives and doesn’t require the stock market to drop yet ya’ll ain’t interested. Whack
1	Make unvaccinated pay for their hospital stays
1	I don’t feel sorry at all for people who don’t listen…. Especially this guy.
1	As a pharmacist, I feel this. If you disregard science and choose to actively put patients at risk, then you're in the wrong job.
0	Just in case the first six didn't work and you still believe, the seventh is ready.
1	Smart people get vaccinated.
0	Not against science, just not sold on these vaccines. Keeping it real.
0	Yeah don't get the boosters if you like living
1	Retired RN. Fully boosted. Will get this when I get flu shot. By that time, will be more info about human reaction to this vaccine. I plan for early October.
0	Pure blood here, keep the faith No vaxxers
0	I am disgusted by the way I was treated as someone unvaccinated during the pandemic.
1	I love how everyone is so fixated on the long term effects of the vaccine, when they don't even consider the long term effects of being infected with covid.
0	I’ve had Covid twice and yeah it sucked but I haven’t gotten any vaccine and I’ve been completely fine. It’s just a killer headache and a sore throat with fatigue for a week. And that’s only because my whole house had Covid at the same time so it took a little to die down.
0	It’s starting guys stay away from the vaccines. We don’t know what’s in it.
1	Some people make studying this stuff and preventing illness and disease their entire life. They go to college for it and everything. These people are called doctors. Their opinions should be considered in the context of their expertise and experience. Your relatives (and also mine) don't know jack shit and get their information from the comment section on Fox News. Their opinions should also be considered in the context of their expertise and experience. If my doctor recommends it for my baby, you're god damn right I'm going to do it.
0	My child's immune system can't handle so many vaccines at once!
1	I long for a society where we can all at least agree that science is one of the most amazing and important achievements of humanity. It is literally the reason human beings live so long these days. Science and medicine progress has given us prolonged life!
1	There have been thousands of people who have died since the start of covid vaccination. So, yeah, it's TOTALLY people dying because of the vaccine, not that there are 5 million people and it's been 3 years.
0	i like people who refuse to take shots.. shows who can think for themself
1	We live in the age of MISINFORMATION, more people would rather believe some random post they saw a friend post on Facebook than listen to an actual scientist. Truly crazy times we live in
0	Good luck being a test subject, as there is zero long term study data. Nada. None. All the papers and medical journal peer reviews you cite have no idea what these vaccines will do 1-5 years from now, or 15 for that matter. Even Pfizer's stage 3 trial only lasted 6 months. I prefer to stay in the control group, thank you.
1	I got mine a week or so ago, 2.5g installed, can't wait to get the full connectivity!
0	feel bad for all those who were forced to get them in the first place
1	Me: I’m not so sure about all this stuff…but I really don’t want Covid. Reluctantly gets vaccinated.Video: “immortal human cells.”Me: PUT EM IN ME NOW!!!
0	I've never been vaccinated, and I've never gotten COVID. I have a Doctor who was vaccinated several times, and she got COVID twice... I also have a friend who never had a health problem in his life, and less than 2 weeks after getting the vaccine he was hospitalized with swollen lymph nodes around his heart (which constricted his breathing). He now has Hypoglycemia, Graves Disease, and anemia. I'm not sure if it was the vaccine, but it all happened immediately after.
0	I had V-Safe. Took the jab reluctantly. Now, am sorry I did. the night of first shot, started having hearing issues in left ear, same side as shot. Constance ringing, tinnitus. Still ringing after two years. Since then, developed A-Fib. Prior to this, my heart was as healthy as they come. had 58-60 heart rate, and pressure always between 110-120 over 70-80. Now is all over the place.. The doctors say its an age thing. I say it's the jab thing.
1	I gave up on the issue a long time ago. Trying to reason with a antivaxxer is like explaining simple math to a hamster.
0	Vaccines are just a way for big pharma to make money. No thanks.
0	I heard a voice inside of me telling me not to take it! So I didn’t.
1	Vaccinateded and thriving!
1	I’m not a anti vaxxer
1	Vaccines are freedom
0	Not everyone needs the vaccine, right?
0	Stay away from the poison
1	Vaccines are not gene therapy. They literally do not enter your genome. It's mRNA. Even if it enters one of your cells (generally it's white blood cells hunting these down), it stays in the cytoplasm outside the nucleus and is broken down within days.  As to risks, that's bad risk assessment (thus, not a good reason). The vaccine adds an extra layer of protection and reduces transmission. There's more risk of getting seriously ill from covid with natural immunity than there is from getting an adverse side effect from the vaccine. The vaccine also costs you nothing. It's a no-brainer probabilistically.
0	I’m not sure having everyone vaccinated will actually stop the spread any more :( politicians are over stepping their bounds here, especially on a medication that has only existed for a year (no long term data).
0	The only thing you need to know- DON’T TAKE IT!
1	The reason you don't have Polio is because you were vaccinated against that virus. Please let's embrace Covid vac
1	It's like he learned over time, almost like evidence matters to him.
1	Yes, we all have to contribute our fair share.
1	I had COVID about a month ago. It was super mild for me. But I’m double vaxed and boosted.
1	Just got my 3rd booster! The vaccine has worked great. I've only gotten covid twice and I didn't have to go to hospital either time
0	They are not safe please...people are suffering from the side effects of the vaccine lowkey.
1	Vaccinated individuals are essential for achieving and maintaining herd immunity.
0	He is 200% right. If you’re young and healthy, why get it? She said to help stop spread. They already admitted they don’t know if it stops spreads. So ones speaking facts, the other is talking out their ass.
1	Yeah, but this won’t convince antivaxxers, they will insist thier wrong beliefs are still valid and this is all follow the money or some such crap
0	Unvaxed and proud
0	Remember it was sold to us here in the UK as "Safe and effective " .. got alot of grief at work for not taking it. Proud to be an Anti Vaxer! So sorry for all the people who felt they had no choice.
1	vaccination is a simple, safe and effective way to protect against harmful diseases before coming into contact with
0	Praise God I am retired and did not need to take the poison to keep my job
1	Vax day! A step closer to normal. So ready for this.
1	Shame that these teachers were unvaccinated, even sadder is that many others will still not care and continue to spread misinformation
1	Please get it if you are able. Not only to protect yourself, but to protect kids under 12 who can’t be vaccinated yet, and those who can’t be vaccinated due to allergy/illness.
0	Dr. Rapiti, rightfully, called it a bioweapon, very courageous.
1	That makes the anti vax clowns domestic terrorists but we already knew that when they went around attacking people who acted responsible.
1	I got both my shots and this is the safest I’ve felt since covid started..... still don’t feel that safe sue to the people not getting vaccinated and leaving that window open for the delta variant to spread.
1	Getting vaccinated allows me to safely engage in community events.
1	I’m a physician and I don’t like this reporting at all. It invites a financial justification of everything we do. Next, some bean counter right will point out that the surviving Medicare recipients will cost many more billions because they didn’t die during the epidemic. We try to save lives because it’s the right thing to do, not because it’s cost-effective.
1	If there is no universal vaccine, the virus will really spread if it takes several days to be detected in big cities based on its contagiousness!
1	Got it and have no regrets. All ready booked the next booster
0	. This vaccine have long-term consequences we're not being told about
1	I will be getting the vaccine asap.    My parents are both in several high risk categories.  I have been so scared for them and want to protect them as much as possible.
0	Worried about potential side effects more than COVID itself
1	Proud to have gotten my vaccine and to be part of the solution!
0	why inject yourself with chemicals when nature gave you an immune system? #NaturalImmunity
0	I'll just opt out of being experimented on
1	I also got the Johnson and Johnson vaccine, im a doctor, I couldn't get the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine because im allergic. My arm was sore and I felt fatigued for about an hour. I totally do not regret taking it.
0	As nurse during COVID on a COVID step down unit I personally cared for 3 people just like this man……I wouldn’t say it is a rare occurrence…..
0	And the vaccine wars were about trying to diminish the AZ vaccine so the more expensive ones could make a bigger profit.
0	Please keep all of your records. Never can we let the bastards who forced these jabs on people, knowing they were not safe, nor the practitioners who did not care enough to advise their patients to avoid this injection, get away with saying “we didn’t know the harm they could cause”. We knew - they knew.
1	I hated jabs and was young so never got the flu jab. But since having COVID jabs I kind of got used to them so now I get my flu jab yearly. Much healthier over winter now.
1	Odd that the people who question vaccines are the same people who don’t question the medicines they put into their mouths when they get sick. Do they know that vaccines and medicines are researched and manufactured in a similar way?
0	If you like being sick, and are tired of being alive, keep getting boosted.
0	My Mom died in August. She suddenly was struck with Cancer. At the time of death, you could have placed a great fruit in the wound in her belly easily. For 6 months straight, she talked about how she shouldn't have gotten the vaccine
1	I salute the brave souls who volunteered for the trials, especially the ones who unfortunately got the placebo. Humanity might just find a way forward because of their sacrifice/leap of faith.
1	Gimme gimme gimme!!!
0	I’m considering starting a blood bank for purebloods only.
0	How can anyone say a drug that doesn't have any long-term test results yet is totally safe? That's the main reason I'm skeptical about it.
0	there are filed reports already about these vaccines, worst are death cases. And yet you're saying that it's still not dangerous??
0	Imagine that the government has to bribe you to take something that's "good" for your body
1	The science is clear: vaccines do not cause autism.
1	"Vaccination is an essential tool in reopening schools and ensuring a safe learning environment."
0	Ill stick with my natural immune system, thanks. I'll also take my chances with the afterlife over a tyrannical gov.
0	no way. I knew it was bad news from day 1
1	Hearing from people saying they regret not taking the vaccine.
0	She prolly got paid to say that it is "safe".
0	I would not believe sunak if he if opened his mouth he is full of verbal crap .he needs to step down he is not honest
1	Vaccination is a crucial step toward ending the pandemic.
1	Well, anti vaccination parents are, for all intents and purposes, murderers.
0	I haven't take the vaccine yet because I want to know if it's safe or not
1	In the brazilian trials for Sinovac they didn't use random regular people, but medical professionals who were basically guaranteed to be exposed to the virus. Still, they found 100% protection against severe cases and hospitalizations.
0	I won't be getting that shot. No way in hell.
0	The COVID shot is safe as long as you don’t take it
1	Antivaxxers get so weird about vaccines when we have "the jabs" to thank for the eradication of smallpox, complications from polio, and measles WAS on the decline until recently...hmm i wonder why??
1	I received my Moderna vaccine last weekend and was so relieved that I didn't get the worse side effects known by getting this vaccine. My arm was a little sore but this went away in a couple days. Hopefully, the last dose will arrive promptly.
0	Heart and Brain damage…
1	Everyone working in hospitals should get vaccinated Period. It isn’t a choice it is a Pandemic.
0	DONT TAKE it ! no damn vaccine take 9 months to make the shortest time it took in history was 4 YEARS . you guys are brainwashed.
0	@CDCgov You can stick your poison vaccine up your ass! #NoVaccineForMe #VaccineGenocide2020
0	I'm vaccinated, but to protect others i'm wearing my mask and still practicing social distancing....I don't think this thing is over yet...
0	My mother lost her life due to the vaccine
0	I am an 68 year old woman. The last time I was hospitized was in 1960, right after the Polio vaccine , I developed Viral Encephalitis post Chicken Pox! I NEVER take the flu vaccine, rarely got the flu. If I did get the flu ,I treated it with Homeopathic remedies. I was a US Navy Nurse Corps scholarship student in college. I left nursing, got an Honorable Discharge and became a Special Education teacher for 37 years! When I retired from teaching I had 300 Unused Sick Days. I take ZERO prescription drugs. I use ONLY vitamins & some herbs. I am recovering from Covid-19. The very first time I ever got it! I have relatives who were vaxed and had Covid 19 three times!!!!! I didn't get vaxed! When I got Covid 19 , I was NEVER hospitized. I was given a drug to reduce nausea! I am recovering at home!
1	Imagine being against something that saved millions of lives. How does someone become that damaged?
1	If you don’t trust the vaccine then you probly don’t trust whoever is calling it safe or doing the tests to call it safe.
1	Man I browse some of the conspiracy subs mostly for alien stuff and the amount of "gotcha! vaccines are actually really bad and we got the receipts" articles are insane. I can easily see how people get brainwashed.
1	Why risk it? The vaccine is a small discomfort for a lifetime of protection. Don't wait, vaccinate! 💉
1	gifted by the doctors
1	lets celebrate the scientist
1	We sane people need to speak the truth: “your refusal to be vaccinated is causing us all to suffer”. But if you get sick you’ll receive treatment and care from the same medical staff that some of you mocked. All that suffering for nothing.
1	My friend was unvaxxed, caught COVID and died
0	After they injected the vaccine they say, "we need to better understand what that risk is "... Nice approach.Shouldn't it be in the opposite order?
1	I was so afraid to get the shot. I have severe allergies and my immune system isn't the strongest but I got my first shot yesterday. It was a story about a 15 year old girl that was suppose to get the shot the next day and got COVID. She died 9 days later. Please take the shot.. My arm hurts but I'm okay.
1	All these vaccines protects you well. All these vaccines are good. Well, they didn't include Sinovac in the list ^^
0	I personally know 11 people including family that died from COVID injections.
0	Heard the vaccine doesn't even guarantee immunity, so what's the point? #NoGuarantee #VaccineDoubts
0	There is a lot of evidence now. There are excess deaths now all over the world.
1	I was so fortunate and PROUD to get my #CovidVaccine yesterday!!! I am so thankful for everyone who made this historic moment possible!!!
0	The shot gave me a stroke then I got these tumor grows. I need a lawyer.
0	it is now 2 years and it’s been a struggle with my health also it takes a toll mentality just to keep positive, I was totally fit and healthy prior.
0	We have an immune system for a reason. If you are heathy and in good shape you don't need a covid vaccine.
0	THANK GOD I DID NOT GET THE VACCINE
0	Dont need it. I've never had covid since the start and also Im not risking the side effects since a colleague of mine recently had the vaccine and died of blood clots.
1	excited to get mine whenever possible 😌
1	That second vaccine felt like it took forever!!! But I just got my booster yesterday, and really liked the retractable syringes.
0	Get the shots or get Covid19 and possibly die—alone and saying goodbye to your family via zoom. Easy. Get the shots.
0	I've never made a better decision in my life by protecting most of my family from the not vaccine.
1	I don’t want her or other unvaccinated hospital personnel being part of my care. Why should she take a chance on spreading the virus to people who are already challenged by physical problems.
1	Y'know I'm glad there are doctors taking the time to educate people about the vaccine
1	Because it exposes that someone who is making a living capitalizing off of extremist views that spread mass harm to the populace is a hypocrite that made sure to protect herself while telling everyone else that protection is a hoax, or at the least untrustworthy and harmful. Calling these people on their bullshit is a good thing to do. It’s not the same thing as “OMG did you hear Taylor Swift broke up with her 35th boyfriend?!”, it actually has real world consequences.
1	It’s a relief to know that I’m less likely to transmit the virus to others after getting vaccinated.
1	Got my first dose this past week! I'm pumped
1	I just got my 2nd vaccine 2 days ago.  I got in line as soon as I was qualified.  Yeah, I've felt super tired for the last 2 days, but I would rather that than risk my health, my family's health, and the rest of my community.  Hank is right.  It is just a
1	Covid was a deadly pandemic and that vaccines saved millions of lives.
1	The anti-vaccine movement has literally become a death cult at this point. The next two months are going to be insane to watch.
1	Vaccines are mostly water or saline, the virus and the culture medium it was grown in, and preservatives like glycol or maybe small amounts of formaldehyde or thimerisol. You could absolutely drink the amount used in a vaccine and be fine. I ate an oatmeal pie I found on the floor of my car today that was definitely 100% more full of preservatives.
1	First time I see people being more afraid of a cure than the actual virus
0	I am unvaccinated and don't have any regrets.
1	people who don't get vaxxed are idiots
0	Vaccines are experimental. I'm not volunteering to be part of a grand experiment.
1	got it n the booster 1 week ago n im great! i feel safer
0	Three weeks after my second AstraZeneca vaccine, I was hospitalised for four days after having bad lung pain and breathlessness for a week. Cat scans showed massive clots in both lungs. I’m still taking blood thinners after more than 12 months…and will probably be taking them for years…if not forever.
1	Vaccination is no reason that one should stop following COVID-appropriate behaviour. Our fight against COVID-19 is not over yet! Be responsible, stay safe
1	No shit, had 5 vaccines, rocks better than MDMA against Corona!
0	It IS UNSAFE! Just look how they wouldn't release the test trial information, if they were done! Many "vaccines" were rushed do to the "emergency state!" Look at the efficacy rate...it doesnt last! Soooo many people brainwashed by the mainstream media and government! LIARS, THE LOT OF THEM!
0	We all know it’s the Jabby. And these evil people push for it still… crazy
1	I had my vaccinations as a kid and im still here because of them i dintnunderstand why people are acting like this is such a new thing theres vaccines that save lives
0	I'd sympathize with them more if they actually at least tried to explain their symptoms to a doctor and have them run some tests to see what's actually wrong with them, rather than being attention whores on social media and using their self-diagnosed Long Covid as a badge of honor among their fellow Covidians and other far-leftists.
0	Mandatory vaccines? What happened to freedom of choice?
0	The shot was approved without the trials demonstrating ANY clinical benefits whatsoever. The drugmaker's own data show the booster shots make covid infection MORE LIKELY. Why should ANYBODY get these?
1	Yes, take any shot you can. Having said that, isn't the efficacy of Pfizer still quite higher than J&J even against variants? Like 70%-90% in tests. (which is no reason to not take it, just pointing that out)
1	I'd like to emphasize for everyone here that regardless fo what % effective the vaccine is that is ONLY if everyone in the population takes it. A vaccine can't be 90% effective if half the country doesnt take it (then only about 45% of the country will be "immune")
1	The Covid vaccines are safe
0	I never got the vaccine nor the covid19. For me it was obvious from the start they're just chancing it because they needed to stick to something to soothe the masses. There was no real scientific consensus and I don't like politicians and random mouth breathers lecture me about what I need to put in my body. Now that I see the studies about the many adverse side side effects I can only say I'm glad not to be a blind follower. The whole thing might've been over way faster if we just let it run it's course and develop herd immunity that way.
0	Those people who did not get vaccinated are happy there's plenty of people that got the vaccination who are not
0	Most people that decide to take the route against vaccinations are not "Anti"-Vaxxers, the technical term would be "Ex"-Vaxxers after watching a loved one suffer directly after administration of the poison.
0	Thank you for saying what us medical professionals have been seeing since the vaccine got pushed out. My mom died on March 18th 2023 whilst being fully vaccinated/boosted after being admitted to the icu diagnosed with covid-19, a brain bleed, a stroke and active blood clots..it also kicked in her Parkinson's. Seeing what I've seen over these years, in my heart I know it was vaccine related. I quit the medical field for good a couple weeks ago because of what I seen/believed all along. Thank you for just backing up what most of us believe when it comes to these vaccines.
1	Thanks Nurse Yonela #jabbed #vaccinated #chuffed
0	This is such BS!   😂    Can’t you see that ppl are aging at an accelerated rate internally, as well as externally?   Do you not see the pattern of dental work being needed after infection?  It’s an ELECTRICAL ISSUE in the body.  Your organs have battery packs, and now they’re messed up.  The voltage is the cells is lowering.  Your mask and 💉won’t do a damn thing, but keep you in the “other” storyline.  It’s not whats really happening.  Good luck.  👍
0	Give this a miss! They want your health to be broken!
0	Kudos to all of you who didn't cave to the pressure and refused the jab. You're my people.
0	the government is not telling the whole story, supposedly the side effects are 2 to 3 days, I have been with side effects for three weeks, I started breathing very hard and bone pain and a lot of fatigue. this was the first and the second does not interest me. We are all different and nothing happens to many, but they should say that many people have had side effects for longer and stronger.
0	Don't take it that's all I need to know
0	My father's best mate of like 45 years was convinced to get the vaccine by his doctor . Dies of a heart attack after his 1st booster . They found him on the floor of his kitchen both hands clenched over his heart . He was perfectly healthy before that . His doctor used to say your the healthiest 75 yo man I've ever seen your going to live to be 100. Yeah .
1	We have a vaccine to protect people and yet these morons won't take it.
0	The vaccines killed more people than the disease.
1	Most people i know are conservative. Everyone I know has the vaccine.
0	No vaccine for me. I believe in the power of a healthy lifestyle to fight off illness.
1	Exactly, what it came down to was risks versus benefits of both sides. I eventually saw the benefits of vaccination highly outweighing not doing so. Thanks for sharing :)
1	Just got mine today, Pfizer , no symptoms at all
1	So much worse than the fake vaccine/autism link: "If you get [the future] vaccine for #COVID19 you will go to hell". I weep for the innocent people these fools will take with them. (Their pastor, meanwhile, will probably get vaccinated incognito.)
0	Massive hair loss 2,5 months after 2nd Pfizer vaccine. Massive hair loss 2,5 months after Pfizer booster. I'm almost bald now. Well done Pfizer ??
1	Apparently being "open minded" only counts to narratives spread by conservative politicians, news pundits, and YouTubers/radio hosts, not to actual official data presented by scientists with specific expertise in vaccine study.  How good your eyesight is doesn't matter if you willfully choose to not train your eyes on official sources and read data for yourself, data which is overwhelmingly demonstrative of the fact that the covid-19 vaccines are both safe and effective, as I've already demonstrated throughout this thread.
1	Hank, I've done the blenderised Happy Meal (including the Sprite, all sat-out at room temp all day)
1	100% convinced – vaccines work. Just look at the data
0	Myocarditis is no joke, but covid is
1	I am from Nepal thanks to India for giving vaccine to Nepal at free of cost
1	so happy you got the vaccine!
0	Its not covid, its the chinese flu, Its not a vaccine, it produces no immune.
1	All these vaccines are good.
0	the first covid vaccine I got gave me heart palpitations, no thanks.
1	I'm so glad I got vaccinated! I feel much safer knowing that I have some protection against COVID-19.
0	I've had many vaxxs in the past, smallpox all the way through to pneumonia, but to me though, covid vax one looks worthless at best. It's a poor [experimental] vax that doesn't appear to work!
0	FACT: all the biggest recent spikes in infections/hospitalizations have been in places with high vax rates. New mutation variants? Same.
1	That's incredible. Most vaccines aren't that effective. I believe that's much more effective than even the measles vaccine. And they sprinted a marathon to get this done in record time.
1	Just got my 2nd vaccine!  #moderna #vaccinated #VaccinateFightCorona #VETERAN
1	ye f getting the vax when its still in trials
1	Governments have created this situation. They’ve pushed the message that COVID is mild and downplayed Long-COVID. That leaves a void and has allowed the anti-vax crowd to fill it by blaming the vaccine. The increase in sudden and excess deaths is almost entirely accounted for by COVID.
1	I feel for the hospital staff. I'm fully vaccinated plus the booster and I'm still scared of becoming sick with the cases climbing so fast
0	Oh my gosh, I never got the jab and I’m perfectly fine!
1	Just like flat earthers do with evidence that we live on a globe, most anti-vaxxers will just dismiss the results of the study out of hand (if any of them bother to read about the study in the first place) because they don't align with their presuppositions. They're not interested in the truth. If they were, the anti-vaxx movement wouldn't exist in the first place.
1	This is great. Absolutely love this take on the situation, and helps remind folks that antivaxxers are just people like the rest of us.
1	You don’t really understand vaccines do you…..
1	By vaccinating your child you not only protect them, but countless other children (& adults!) that are medically fragile. It’s simply the right thing to do.
1	Since being vaccinated, I feel more at ease in social settings.
1	I'm grateful for the advancements in medical science that have given us vaccines to protect against various illnesses
0	I have had no shots and dont plan on gettig one ever.
1	Guys relax it's like any other vacine...
0	Vaccines are just like cigarettes. We used to think cigarettes were really good for people and helped us. Then we realized how bad they are… Maybe one day we will realize some stuff about vaccines too.
0	Kudos to all the uninjected!
0	I wouldn't take the vax for a million free hamburgers+fries OR donuts.
0	My Husband died 10 days after having the first AstraZeneca injection. He had a heart condition which was very well monitored. He saw a Consultant every 6months, no red flags everything okay. Covid hit, saw nobody, one phone call. He was okay, but when he told the nurse who gave the injection he had a history of DVT, she told him its safe. Rapid decline, and after a call to 101, he was taken to Hospital. Walked down a steep cobbled lane, laughing and joking with the Paramedics, he climbed into the Ambulance, and I never saw him alive again. Within the hour I had a call telling me to get to the Hospital.Nobody was allowed in the Hospital! I think he was already dead. No time of Death on the certificate. He had only been retired 2 years, after working all his life.
0	Dont get the VAXX!
0	I'm a real gentleman when it comes to vaccines. I always say "You first..."
1	There’s nothing in scripture to say the vaccine or ANY vaccine you received as a child is evil. So why is this one any different from any other vaccine in the world? Because it’s all this political crap you’re being fed online. Get it or done it doesn’t matter but the fact is, all it does is build up your immune system. It doesn’t make you completely immune to COVID it just helps you fight it like ANY OTHER SHOT DOES.
1	Vaccination is an ethical choice to protect the health and well-being of family and community members.
1	Proudly wearing my mask and showing off my vaccination card. Let's keep each other safe.
0	Just the fact that you can't sue drug companys makes me not want to take the jab.
0	Non Vaccinatated People are the best protected ever!!
1	Well, it happened a lot sooner than I thought..........after 1 day, the media making a big deal about 2 cases of vaccine side effects.
1	So happy to see people getting vaccines. I will get the vaccine ASAP
0	Redness at the injection site
1	And how would he have reacted to actual covid I wonder? Most of the people that got the shot ended up fine. There are always side affects to any drug. You have to weigh the pros and cons.
1	I got my second dose last week! So grateful to the folks in my community for volunteering their time to ensure anyone that wants a vaccine can get it. I hope others are utilizing the heck out of that link!
0	After seeing all these posts about dizziness post vaccination, there has to be some correlation. I received my first Pfizer vaccination January 21st. No immediate side effects until 3 days after when I got a severe vertigo attack. I was bedridden for the entire day. The next day I had to take a sick day from work. The vertigo transitioned to dizzy spells, tinnitus, headaches and a general unwell feeling. They would come in waves. In addition, I was having a right earache that would happen every once in a while and would wake me up at night. Went to Urgent Care on February 1st for a COVID rapid test just to make sure  I wasn't infected. Negative results. Family doctor visit the next day. Prescribed meclizine which helped but would make me useless for work. In the meantime, I was alternating between ibuprofen and acetaminophen every few hours which seems to help blunt the dizziness. Went back to Urgent Care on February 15th (President's Day) and was diagnosed with otitis media. Went on a course of augmentin for 10 days. It didn't help with the dizzy spells. Went for a PCR COVID test February 18th with negative results. Family doctor visit March 1st. Prescribed allegra and levofloxacin. Still taking the allegra but never took the levofloxacin. If you look at the list of side effects (including ruptured tendons and death), it would make anyone not want to take it. Also got an order for a MRI with/without contrast and MRA. MRI with/without contrast and MRA done on March 10th. Normal results, no AVMs nor tumors (yeah!). Visit with ENT specialist March 17th. Hearing test shows slight decrease in high frequency hearing associated with age. Balance test normal. Scheduled for a VNG (videonystamography) test April 6th.   Interestingly, I have a friend who has gone through the same situation after getting two doses of Pfizer vaccine. His VNG test came back normal last week. Next step for him might be a visit to a neurologist. I'm also keeping that in mind if my VNG comes back normal.  BTW, foregoing the second vaccination of Pfizer.
1	Lol everyone who actually thinks the vaccine is fake is a wuss to take it LOL
0	The commercial should say, “ Get the vaccine where your guaranteed to get Covid.”
1	Thanks, I really appreciate this explanation. I am going to be vaccinated right now, God bless you guys !
0	Studying vaccine development prior to the COVID outbreak gave me all the information I needed to refuse the new vaccines. Best decision I ever made
0	No to covid vaccine mandate
0	I have more of an athletic lifestyle and had to get the vaccine for work. I had episodes of lightheadedness followed by nausea and intense sweating for almost two months following the first shot. My pcp said it was likely due to this condition cause by the vaccine. I no longer have those episodes but completely regret the vaccine. I shoulda found another job
1	So first, as a virologist you should get your booster.  But as a human, I also get the side effect part. These COVID vaccines mess me up. Usually it’s ~2 days of chills, headache, light fever, and an arm I can’t hardly move. It’s better than a week of that from actual COVID, but I basically need the shot on Friday and spend all weekend feeling like hot garbage. Not everyone can or is willing to do that.
0	Never forget the lies they told us about the jab. Now their own studies are linking Long Covid to the vaccine.
0	I'm 74, unvaxed. Over these 3.5yrs, I've spent much time in crowded homes, apartments, offices, businesses, events,  cars,  buses, & trains. I use diet, supplementation, exercise, rest, sleep, & socialization to stay well. c100 of my vaxed friends, relatives,  neighbors, & acquaintances, have had COVID, many severely.     I've remained disease-free.
1	Vaccination is an act of community service. Together, we protect each other.
0	My family and I are unvaccinated, and we're perfectly healthy. No need for vaccines when we can rely on our natural immune systems.
1	Please pray for FLORIDA it’s a COVID-19 HOT SPOT Citizens protect your Families...Be responsibly and wear your mask stay clean and don’t Congregate!!! Stay Home 🙏💖
1	Vaxxed up to help our frontline peeps and healthcare heroes. Let's show 'em some love by getting vaccinated!
1	Thank you! I was having doubts about the vaccine but now I feel more confident that I should get it.
0	I'm skeptical of the profit motives behind vaccine promotion.
0	Mother put her 12-year-old in the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine clinical trial & she ended up in a wheelchair.  Heartbreaking story but what mother in her would put let their children be used as a guinea pig?? Media won’t even cover this
1	I got the Pfizer vaccine—both shots. I had zero side effects.
1	No Covid vaccines are one of the safest vaccines ever made.
1	By getting vaccinated we reduce the number of us who can carry and spread it. Vaccinations is what eliminated smallpox.
1	You are significantly reducing your chances of severe complications.
1	I could never be friends with, or even be social to, an antivaxxer. The hate I have for them is visceral.
0	The only thing to know is that I will never take this poison.
1	As you are a vital health care worker, I hope you have either already been vaccinated or gotten an appointment to get one in the next few days, SD.
0	But why is it so much more effective than like the flu vaccine? Seems odd dont you think?
1	The conspiracy theory (or rather, one of the primaries among many) goes that the vaccines are supposed to be eventually lethal as part of a global depopulation effort. So the shadowy cabal don't actually care who's left, as long as the depopulation happens. Also, a significant portion of the vaccines were allegedly just saline in order to throw off statisticians and reporters monitoring for death rates. This all falls apart of course if you think about it for more than eight seconds, but there it is.
1	No, we are still very happy that we took the vaccines and did not catch COVID.
0	Any other product would have been pulled from the shelves a long time ago. Goes to shows someone’s making mega bucks off this poison. It’s real purpose isn’t to help but to kill and control.
0	Seems there’s no stopping Omicron. Here I am, triple vaxxed, and throwing cold medications down my throat because I have COVID. Even Gibraltar, which has a 97% vaccination rate per US News, is seeing a big spike in cases.
1	I totally DISAGREE, it is not effective and doesn't prevent transmission
1	I have a breakthrough case right now. I have some congestion and that's all. My unvaccinated family members who I got it from have been in the hospital, having trouble breathing, and having to get experimental treatments.
1	11, 12, 2, does it really matter? They are all bigger than 1. Unvaccinated people are more likely to die from COVID than vaccinated.
1	If many can see this in my country, there will no demonstration. People just think about the side effect and clinical trials have been conduct too fast but the main point here is how to protect your life
0	I took was forced to take 2 shoots , and after 9 months, now im having deep chest pain and lack of breath, im on my 30s, we will see what the medical exames reveal
1	The vaccination experience highlighted the importance of accurate information and communication in public health initiatives.
0	The only thing you need to know- DON’T TAKE IT!
0	Scientists Call for Global Moratorium on mRNA Vaccines, Immediate Removal From Childhood Schedule.
0	I'm facing a terrible dilemma. Either get the covid vaccine or drop out of nursing school with only months left. I simply wish to defer getting this vaccination until there is sufficient evidence of long term adverse effects and a clear indication of overall risks. Healthcare workers should not have to forfeit the right to choose the drugs they put in thier body. We are not the villains.
1	My brother was of the .01%. He has high BMI, asthma, COPD, an autoimmune disease, and just generally terribly unhealthy. His respiratory doctor warned him that if he contracted covid he would nearly certainly be on a vent. Happened to be going into the hospital and needed to pass a covid test prior to a procedure. 2 months after receiving the jnj he tested positive. Absolutely no symptoms. Vaccine saved his life.
0	I was permanently injured by this safe and effective vaccine.
0	Some hospitals in some countires have higher percentage of vaccinated covid infections than unvaccinated!
1	Everyone should get vaccinated and, if you have symptoms of any communicable disease, take actions to minimize the spread (stay home, wear mask, etc.).
0	Physicians in emerg depts are not consistently doing investigative tests and procedures which I know of first hand. Therefore there will be less data available to analyze problems that individuals have had post Covid vaccine.
0	I will not be taking it
0	Not only are they not getting vaccinated but they are endangering children too young to get vaccinated. Hugely disappointing selfishness.
1	Fully vaccinated here! Let's create a stronger defense against COVID-19 by getting vaccinated and staying safe.
1	I was shocked when I found out that one of my friends hadn't been vaccinated for Covid - and wasn't going to be, because she "didn't trust the government".  Later, she told me that she knew the Earth was flat "because I've walked on it and it FEELS flat."   (I should say ex-friend, not friend.)
1	cant wait to see my relatives!! jab incoming
0	The longer this has gone on, the more relieved I am that I never got the jab.
1	I do remember polio. One of my earliest memories is of spending months in the hospital away from my family because I had it. I remember children in iron lungs because they couldn't breathe on their own.  Most people don't even know what that is anymore.  And then of having neighbors keeping their children away from me after I recovered because it was such a frightening disease.  I also remember everyone lining up at the local junior high to get the vaccine when it was finally developed. I don't remember anyone protesting against it and saying but how do we know it's safe and what about side effects.  They were grateful that they and their children were finally safe.
1	Thank you WHO For help human on the world.
1	Eh. I'm not anti-vaxer. I've gotten my booster and I'm about to get my 2nd but why get angry at this? It just isn't worth it.
0	Absolutely, the immune systems are compromised. I don't know for sure, but I believe I'm the only person on my team who isn't vaccinated and these people are repeatedly getting sick with "covid". The latest one is my manager and her entire family.
0	Good luck with health problems in the future
1	y'all are reisisting them pretty hard. At least they are doing their best to educate and keep people healthy. Especially the ones who play guitar and think they know more than the scientific medical community.
0	Its not as effective as your own immune system if you have already gotten a covid strand.
1	You can still get Covid after vaccination, but it would very possibly not be as severe, which could mean life saving. I am fully vaccinated, feeling ok with the vaccines.
1	Just got my first vaccine!! #Moderna Mahalo to @HawaiiDOH for running such a smooth clinic in Kona! #CovidVaccine
0	Pffft, who needs a vaccine when you've got those flintstone vitamin gummies from 10 years ago.
1	Getting vaccinated is not just about me; it's about us as a society. #CommunityImmunity
0	covid- lockdowns, was the longest 2 years of my life. And possibly the worst. draining my savings, isolation, no work, constant social pressure relentless hate, friends and family turning on me. Lost my job finally. But the reward is I get to watch all this unfold from the comfort of my living room with my new job. All you people trying to thrust this evil on everyone else...you deserved it. Enjoy your new "health"!
0	I'd rather take my chances with the virus than risk unknown long-term effects of the vaccine.
1	The vaccine represents not just scientific achievement, but our collective desire to protect our communities.
1	I was hesitant at first, but after doing my research and speaking with my doctor, I decided to get vaccinated. My side effects were minimal, and the peace of mind it offers is invaluable.
0	No regrets here! Healthy and happy and completely unvaxed!!
0	Long-term side effects are a major concern with these vaccines.
0	Vaccines are rushed, and we don't know the long-term effects. I'll stick to natural immunity, thank you very much
1	The covid vaccine that I don’t mind taking would be Sputnik v because it is the safest covid vaccine so far
1	Honestly if it would kill you why would every country want you to get vaccinated. "ALMOST" every country
1	People everywhere who got jabbed are sicker than those who were not!  Not just my opinion!
0	17 year old guy had pfizer shots and has had multiple heart attacks.
0	My mother in law has deteriorated so bad constant headaches, rashes, and can’t remember Anything after her shots. Very active and mentally smart prior. Doctors deny it was jabs some nurses say opposite but afraid to say otherwise. I have zero trust in most doctors toda
0	I am unvaccinated and don't have any regrets.
0	20k vaccines related deaths in 9 months according to CDC in US alone, so I’ll get leave this here.
1	Got vaccinated to protect the vulnerable and create a safer environment for everyone. Let's all get vaccinated for a healthier society.
1	This vaccine can be produced everywhere and stop this in poorer countries far faster than mRNA vaccines. And with the right dosing regime it appears it can be nearly as effective. This is fantastic news.
0	The devil knows that he has so little time...
0	I'm not taking that fucking vaccine lmao. You guys can turn into zombies but not me.
1	Positive comments are hard to get.. Had my vaccine shots 6 months ago no covid yet.. coz i was staying in wooden cabin in the woods
1	I mean great, but who is this information for? Anyone who didn't believe they were safe from the previous scientific studies isn't going to be convinced by new scientific studies.
1	I received the AstraZeneca vaccine. I experienced a mild fever, chills and injection site pain within 24 hours of receiving the vaccine but I took panadol, drank a lot of water and got some rest and I was fine after.
0	The real issue is survivability.  How many unvaccinated died VS how many vaccinated died.  THOUSANDS were dying from covid when it first hit.  People forget how awful it was.
1	I have had 3 Moderna vaccinations, with little or no reactions, and I have been very well. We are no longer wearing masks. These MRNA vaccines have saved many lives!
1	For those that get their medical advice from a 48 year old mom on Tiktok who has worked as a receptionist and a cashier, the vaccine does not STOP the infection, it helps to train your body on what to fight to make it less severe or quicker.
1	We apparently must allow those around us to make poor decisions at the detriment of death of they and their family. My own brother; his wife, and kids, refuse to be vaccinated. I pray I don’t lose one or some of them.
1	What brain damage can occur from vaccines? And please find 1 CONFIRMED study that vaccines cause illness. Not talking about allergy or rash caused by it.
0	Its all about the money...
1	I’m feeling better now and feeling grateful to be fully vaccinated!
0	Vaccines causes disability!
1	My turn to do my part! Vaccinated against COVID-19.
0	how tf is possible to not know what are you doing if you sign up for the trials of a vaccine? Even if they give you the real one you can still have secondary effects that can lead you to death so in whatever case you KNOW what you get into.
1	I wear my vaccine sticker as a badge of honor. It's not just for me it's for the vulnerable in our society who can't protect themselves.
1	Another reason to get #vaccinated AND stay up to date for #COVID19. It decreases the risk of #LongCovid!! Get boosted!
0	We do not wanna get vaccination or something like that. Does anybody hear our voice??? I’ve survived from corona at home without any medicine. My relative that had a hard time during their recoveries also survived from it at thome. The half of my country people have survived it. I don’t wanna get a vaccination for something that I’ve already gotten the immunity for.
1	I was vaxxed in March, 2021. My family is anti-vax, but even they are not that level of crazy with this. I do not know your denomination or background, but if anyone is telling you what they just told you, they are falsely preaching. You cannot lose your salvation. Science and medicine are gifts from God.
1	Exciting news! The advancements in vaccine technology are truly remarkable.
0	Proud pure blood here. Kick rocks Kimmel
0	All i need to know is that like all the others im not taking it
1	It’s really hard for me to feel bad for the unvaccinated patients.
0	I have a medical condition and am worried about how the vaccine will interact with it.
1	China has approved the third Covid-19 vaccine from Sinopharm to start clinical trials #BreakingNews #Sinopharm #China
0	I NEVER took the jab. I was pressured by my own family, criticized, and bullied but i stood my ground. MY BODY MY CHOICE RIGHT?
0	They planted some nasty shi*t in you lot with these COVID-19 vaccines
1	Had mine on Sunday, felt rough Monday, head and body aches, bit of fever. On a scale of 1-10 I'd say 5/10. Took paracetamol which made me feel better. As of today, Tuesday morning I'm feeling fine again, just have a slightly tender arm where the jab went in. That'll pass soon I'm sure. I know 3 people who have died from the virus, one a 30 yo man with no health issue. I'm glad I had the vaccine.
0	Injecting experimental drugs into my body is not something I'm comfortable with, especially when the long-term consequences are unknown.
1	Correlation does not equal causation. Get your kids vaccinated.
0	I have epilepsy because of a vaccine when I was a baby. I seized all day after the vaccine yet the doctors said this was normal and my mom shouldn't bring me in! Luckily my mom knew to always listen to doctors!  And I always hear people mocking me for not wanting to vaccinate my children like I'm just an absolute moron. How many people are expected to go against their own personal experience and still listen to the medical advice?!?!?
0	Hey there. I’m vaccinated. However, there has been a surge of “mystery” deaths in young people.   Why is this do you think? Because i’m progressively beginning to regret my decision to get vaccinated a year ago.
1	It's a dangerous idea to tell people to not get vaccinated in hopes that they don't die from the disease and subsequently get natural immunity. You get immunity only if you don't die or get permanently disabled upon initial infection, and I hear death is a bit of a doozy.
1	The benefits of COVID-19 vaccines far outweigh the risks. They not only protect individuals from severe illness but also contribute to community immunity, making us all safer.
0	Safe? My nephew, a Head Nurse in the Philippines had the AZ vaccine and the adverse reaction after 12 hours was life-threatening. His blood pressure went very high, he was sweating, turned red, huffing and puffing. He is in his 30's and healthy. He was rushed to the hospital where he works and was given an antidote to lower his blood pressure and spent the night in the hospital for observation. Scary!!!
0	I'll preface this by saying that is strictly anecdotal, but I know three women who died suddenly of heart attacks while sleeping.  Coroners noted they were suffering from inflammation of the heart muscle. The women were 38, 49 and 52 years of age. None of the women had any history of heart disease,  but all had been required to have the Covid vaccine as a condition of continuing their employment.
0	The only thing to know is that I will never take this poison.
0	Evidence ? What evidence, we dont need no friggin evidence to tell us it’s just injecting you with CIA control nanobots.
1	Yay! Yes. A good reminder! Covid Vaxed x2, Boosted x3 (and Monkey pox x2 for good measure) here!
1	A lot of vaccine haters don't respond to contradicting replies... It's really sad when somebody refuses to convert to an actual educated opinion
1	here in Portugal with an almost 100% vaccine rate, mask-wearing *out of respect for others has worked amazingly... I am triple vaxed. no health issues and no problems... I'm SO glad Portugal handled this way.It had nothing to do with freedoms, just common sense and an attitude of caring for each other.
0	Why is the masses not concerned that the Covid-19 vaccine(s) came out so quickly? If that's not evidence of the Covid-19 virus being engineered as part of a global de-population effort, with the vaccine being phase 2 of the plan.
0	I regret the first two jabs.
0	Dang look at all these bots saying “vaccines” are good
0	It used to be you were told "dont give in to peer pressure and experiment with drugs" Now they say "listen to your peers, take the experimental drugs" I dont want anything that teaches my body to attack it's own cells. I will remain in the control group.
0	Covid is absolutely real. I'm a cancer survivor who had it. It sucked. But the covid vaccine injuries out there are also real...and numerous. I will never take it.
1	Looking forward to getting a covid booster along with my annual flu vaccination. Reject the health benefits of modern medicine at your own peril.
0	If a person or government is forcing you to do or take something, you don't have to do any research or prove anything, just refuse it by default, because they want to hurt you.
1	Got my second booster today! It's like giving my immune system a superhero upgrade. #VaccinePower
1	how are the anti-vaxxers talking about the pros downplaying something while completely downplaying all the risks of not vaxxing themselves?
0	This man Madhi should be put on social media trial for spreading misinformation. He is not speaking truthfully or honestly, and he KNOWS he is lying. Evil people like him should not be allowed a public voice.
1	The vaccine is a miracle of modern medicine. Grateful to have it
0	Listen here: I haven't taken ANY safety procedures so I don't get it. And guess what?! I still don't have it. That's why I'm not getting the vaccination. Because I DONT need one.
1	I'm fully vaccinated and boosted. I have COVID right now! It feels like a mild cold. The first time I got COVID was before I was vaccinated. I got a lung infection and coughed so much my throat bled. I felt like crap for months afterwards.
0	vaccines are just a money-making scheme for Big Pharma. they don't care about your health!!!
1	I only had the first shot. Didn't feel anything different. Didn't feel I need another shot.
0	Re-programs your DNA, yea, that's gonna be a NO for me.
0	Just say no to drugs
0	I won't be a guinea pig for a vaccine with limited long-term studies.
1	The vaccine is a safe and effective way to slow the spread of COVID-19, and I’m proud to have done my part!
0	I'm okay with vaccines in general, but this one's too new for me.
0	Human body can fight this virus by proper Hot Steam or Doing like Sauna. This organization Thinks people are Stupid.
1	My Husband and I, Both 68, took both vaccines and had no problem at all... I even helped on Valentine's Day at my daughter's flower shop. I had to get the second vaccine then.... I went right back to work and I never was sore or tired....
1	People are not taking vaccines in the hope that everyone else would be vaccinated and they would be safe.
1	I was hesitant at first, but the decrease in cases and hospitalizations since the vaccine rollout has been convincing.
0	Do yourselves a favour and don’t put this into your bodies people.
1	There is zero evidence that anyone died from the vaccine. But of course you don't care about evidence. You prefer to mindlessly repeat misinformation that you heard from some random unqualified science denialist
1	The side effects are just for a while
0	Hi Guardian. I took all the necessary vaccines in my life, yet I refuse to take a vaccine that has not been thoroughly tested. Does that make me an anti-vaxxer? Can you label someone who has already been vaccinated willingly many times, but is being sceptical about a specific vaccine an "Anti-Vaxxer"?
1	I’m only 46, so post-polio vaccine, but my mother’s boss had polio as a kid and wore leg braces and walked with two canes. Just heartbreaking. And all the people who suffer from long COVID when they could have gotten vaccinated may not even have learned their lesson.
1	As a 26 year old living in the UK, all of you in the US need to know how privileged you are simply by having it available to you. I have to wait until June or July. And every other country has to wait even longer!
1	Y'know I'm glad there are doctors taking the time to educate people about the vaccine
1	I picked Johnson & Johnson, thank God.
1	I hope the government does an executive order or something that requires Pfizer to produce enough for everyone and give it out for free
0	Yeah, never had any of those shots and doing just fine, thank you very much. If you feel the need to take them, then by all means take them. Me? Nope, never.
1	Fantastic result, but it'd be premature to think that it's actually 100% effective against severe COVID-19.  Back of the envelope calculation shows a 95% confidence interval of around 89%-100%.  The 99% CI is closer to 80%-100%.  These numbers are only based on getting the vaccine. If you condition it on getting the vaccine and still getting COVID, they'll be wider.  Again, though, a fantastic and wonderful result regardless.
0	There is absolutely no need for vaccines to extinguish the pandemic. I've never heard so much nonsense talked about vaccines. You do not vaccinate people who are not at risk from a disease. You also don't set about planning to vaccinate millions of fit and healthy people with a vaccine that hasn't been extensively tested on human subjects.
1	I feel a sense of empowerment knowing that I have taken a proactive step in battling the virus.
0	Yeah what is in the death jab
1	People who are hospitalized because they refused to get the Covid vaccination should be 100% responsible for all of the medical bills
0	An MP sick with COVID-19, 10 days after receiving the 1st dose of the vaccine
1	I had Covid In November and I’m a health care worker . I’m fully recovered since 11/30 and I’m getting a moderna vaccine this Saturda
0	Autism is a direct result of the MMR vaccine. There's so much evidence!
0	If you'd listened to the conspiracy theorists you would be fine, we did and are fine.
0	No one wants a synthetic, carcinogenic chemical injected into them for a virus that is 99.0654% survivable. Thanks but no thanks!
0	The people that toke it, are getting sick all around me while I’m here healthy . I’ll pass.
0	Over my dead body would i get this vaccine
0	Referring to it as a 'vaccine' is lies/misinfo. It's NOT a 'vaccine'. It's an experimental, DNA-altering, nanoparticle & PEG containing, with ADE, non-licensed/non-FDA approved, female infertility-causing drug. #ItsNotaVaccine #Pfizer #Moderna
1	It's a no-brainer. I'm getting mine asap.Most of us would not be alive today if not for vaccines.
0	I’m so glad I stuck to my guns and refused the vaccine after doing my own research at the time. Thank you for all you do for us. I’ve loved watching you become “enlightened” over these past few years and my respect only grows for you ❤
0	Sadly I took 2 doses..I regret , I don't feel anything but who knows. I will keep praying to Lord keep me safe and intact from any negative impact
1	So happy to receive my #COVIDVaccination I can confirm the main side effect is indeed euphoria! #COVID19
1	Im vaccinated now, had Covid before vaccine. Zero symptoms. Feel so much more protected now
0	You forgot to mention the heart attacks people are getting... Good job at not being biased!!
1	People aren't rational. The best we can be in my opinion is self reflective. If, despite knowing how much benefit it would be to myself and society, I forego vaccination because of some miniscule chance of unanticipated health consequences, and yet at the same time I get up every single day and drive my car even though I KNOW for a FACT I could KILL myself and others, can I take a moment to self assess what is motivating my caution in one area and not the other?
0	Sadly I know of too many people who are having issues after the 3rd booster jab. It's very alarming.
0	i don't trust it, people go real real pale, faint, get very bad headache, throw up, and more i'm not taking the risk of any more bad things happening
0	I just had my first Pfizer shot yesterday and collapsed a few minutes after getting it. Lost my vision and hearing temporary. The side effects are real, no matter what others are saying. I'm 25 btw and never had any other diseases. I also had COVID-19 last year but only mild symptoms compared to the vaccine
0	As someone who hasn't had ANY covid jabs I can say it's been very strange. I've never known so many people to have colds and flu! I haven't caught so much as a sniffle. The family that gave me a hard time about not having the jab aren't saying anything now.
1	We have vaccines and saved vaccines, but they are not fully used all places.
0	Heroic. You are a good man. Much more reserved than I could be in your circumstances. My family (spouse, children and g-children) are all unvaccinated. They will be coming at us again soon. They admit it. God help us. I am looking up for my redemption.
1	Oh I totally agree. Time to do a triage check at the hospital entrance: A) Vaccinated? Come on in. B) Not vaccinated? Wait at the back of the line in hopes for an open bed.
0	if you like being sick, and are tired of being alive, keep getting boosted.
1	All those adverse reactions to vaccines would be an example of someone who NEEDS herd immunity (needs other people to be vaccinated) because she is unable to be vaccinated herself.
1	"Getting vaccinated was an emotional decision for me. I want to hug my grandparents without fear."
0	May 2 2023 took new pfizer vaccine made me sick now for 11 days unbelievable headaches,chills,aches, sore throat and very lazy sleepy feelin
1	Jesus mother fucking Christ I thought this was a satire subreddit have fun dying y'all.
0	I am currently watching various videos to get some more information on the COVID 19 vaccine and I've decided that I'm not getting it. For now I'm doing very well with masks and social distancing, so I'm pretty confident!
0	Im so sick of YouTube and Google not giving me what I search for but trying to change my ideas it's so sneaky!!
0	Science requires observation over years, even decades in order to determine the efficacy, side effects and safety.  It is a mistake to vaccinate everyone with a vaccine that has skipped that crucial step during development.
1	Doing my part and protecting my little man #vaxxed #covid19 #novavax
1	Getting vaccinated is a small act, but it carries immense importance in our fight against this virus.
1	This is why I’m not doing it for my LO. It’s not so much that I don’t trust it, I just think signing up to get boosters all the fucking time for something that doesn’t impact transmission rates, and something that will be relatively minor for her is not worth the time.  I’m doing all the others including flu every year though. If my child ends up having health issues or anything that would put them at more risk for COVID complications then I would do the booster. (Also, I’m vaxxed, because I have asthma and other factors.)  If they came out with a vaccine that was proven to make a much bigger impact on transmission rates, or there was a much more serious strain for under 5 like the flu, I would get it.
0	THANK GOD I DID NOT GET THE VACCINE
0	Never forgetting that there is a world wide pension crisis and they need to get rid of as many recipients as possible! Could this be the reason it's being advised for the over 50s??
1	Please vaccinate me
0	Unvaccinated and proud.
1	Misinformation or distrust of the vaccine can be like a contagion that can spread as fast as measles.
0	Its crime against humanity and they did it for profit.
0	For my healthy tripple vaxxed BF the first one was the last one: he passed away from a sudden heart attack a month after the booster.
0	Those people have my respect for knowing there rights
1	There are complications with or without the vaccine. I have been vaccinated.I am thankful for the vaccine
0	All vaccines are toxic. Every. Single. One.
1	I never had COVID. I had the vaccine. Everyone I know who has the same history as me has had zero complications
0	I got Moderna and I m trying to deal with more adverse effects such as tingling and numbness all around of my body, vessel problems, constant headache, and pain on right side of my stomach. I didn't have any health problems before the vaccine. I don't know what they have done to us. I wish I wouldn't choose the Moderna:/
0	Unvaccinated and proud.
0	Prefer to wait and see more long-term study results
0	The real question would be how the chart would look like if you compare the vaxxed to the unvaxxed in the same age group. That would really clear the debate. But there's a reason why they don't show you that. Isn't it so?
0	Only time will tell but I believe those of us who never got covid shot will be very happy we didn’t
1	Vaccination should be mandatory per our Constitution.
0	"Not getting vaccinated is still more dangerous." Uh-huh. Right.
0	False hope in vaccine. We should be seeking Jesus Christ. The bible teaches to lay your hands on the sick and oray for them.
0	This isnt about health, its about power, control and profits.
0	Dear God please take away all the evil people who are harming your creation and the future for our children. Let those who want to profit from the suffering of your people be EXPOSED!.
0	Avoid the clot shot
1	Let's fight the antivax agenda by instead promoting that vaccines work.
0	The Pfizer vaccs I've had have really stuffed my health up.
0	To every health care worker that takes a stand against the vaccine, you are our first line of defense against the insanity gripping the nation. thank you
1	Fully vaccinated and boosted – no compromises on health! My son and his wife had COVID, but we stayed cautious. Vaccination is our way out of the pandemic
1	Had 5 Covid shots because the Covid virus mutates (changes) just like the flu virus mutates every flu season. That’s why we should get an annual flu vaccine - same for Covid.
1	I really hope that if this works, they announce it to the Undertaker's theme song.
1	Vaccinated, feeling empowered and protected.
1	I’ve had the initial two shots and two boosters. I’m anticipating the next booster will include additional coverage for the Omicron variant.  I fully expect covid vaccinations to become like the yearly flu shots as this pandemic becomes more of an endemic.  I am very fortunate to have two brilliant step-children who have doctorates in microbiology. Both tell me the same thing…this will be with us for a very long time.
0	Vaccines usually take a decade or more of research. No one knows what the side effects may be of an expedited vaccine. I’m pro-vaccination but not for one that was pushed through research.
0	After the 2 phizers and feeling like I was poisoned for 14 months and having heart attack symptoms and nerve damage, I am super upset about being lied to and literally forced to be injected with an experimental drug to keep my basic human rights
0	This is the only vaccine in history that has an acceptable death rate. The side effects in some are bizzare. Isnt it your job to have concern about this and not try to belittle people that do?
1	Pope Francis’s appeal promoting vacination against Covid-19 with approved vaccines as an “act of love”.
0	“The hepatitis vaccine requires 2 boosters” NOT EVERY SIX MONTHS, DUDE
0	The end... " You don't vaccinate people with chronic fatigue syndrome, you are just putting petrol on the fire"   THANK-YOU !!  This was me in April 21. I'd been ill since Mar 20 and In April 21 had Chronic Fatigue. My vax invite came in April 21, I had 11 invites actually. Didn't do it. I'd been ill for over a year, no answers from Drs or Consultants and well my gut instinct was telling me if spike protein does this to me already, didn't seem like the best idea to ask my body to make more. I don't even want to think what may have happened. And I had to put up with people telling me "Just get the jab"  "Don;t be silly"  etc. The look of disgust from some people when I said I wasn't vaccinated and one was a male nurse at my local hospital , gave me a proper lecture. I wasn't;t well and didn't;t want to get into an argument as his made was well and truly made up.  Thanks you John and Robert.
1	hats off to vaccines
1	Fully vaccinated and ready to get back to a sense of normalcy! #FullyVaccinated #NewNormal
0	The amount of relief I feel that I didn't get vaccinated, even though I was pressured by almost every member of my family, is absolutely indescribable! I feel sorry for those who got it though. Best of luck, they're definitely gonna need it.
0	How can it be rare when EVERYONE that I know who took the jab suffered or is suffering side effects?
0	Didn't get vaccinated. That would be a painful way to die.
0	A client of mine died from the same thing after the jab. She was 25
1	My doctor recommended me intake biontech to be honest he said better.
0	It happened to a colleague of mine as well…..after the second dose.
0	No I am not having the vaccine, completely unsafe
0	All of the anti-vaxxers out there I've got one message for all of you I salute you keep up the good work
0	I dont trust any. It almost killed me as a child.
1	As someone who had covid last year and just got vaccinated, trust me, the vaccine side effects are WAY less painful than actually having it.
0	Vomiting is one of the side effects after got the vaccine
1	my husband and I have Astrazneca...and we glad we had it
1	Misinformation works though. Antivaxer are rentlenless and they are always releasing studies to prove their lies. Combine that with social media algorithms that love controversy and this shit gets deadly.To put it in perspective, the USA could easily have more people die of covid this year than fentanyl ODs but everyone is acting like the battle is over.
0	I am remaining unvaxxed. At all cost that is important.
0	Anti vaxxers haven't lost. Employers will want someone to do the job. Shops will want customers. We are the winners! Just sit back, enjoy the ride...
1	WATCHING THIS AS WE WAIT IN LINE TO GET VACCINATED AT DODGERS STADIUM! LETS GO SCIENCE!
0	You'd think that a medical professional would know that, just because you get vaccinated for insert infectious disease here doesn't mean that you won't get sick if you come into contact with a human or animal that carried the infection, one would also hope that a medical professional would know that recovery times vary widely from person to person.
0	Presents a substantially flawed response, postulating that declining birth rates are caused by the covid vaccines. Blocks me after a simple response, pointing out the issues with this "evidence". Enjoy the echo chamber, Mouse.
1	Have kept up with all the boosters and have never had Covid. The vaccine was a gift to humanity.
1	It's not hazardous or superfluous. There's no reason why you shouldn't receive the jab. Thousands of medical professionals concur that it is safe.
0	Science requires honest assessment and controlled challenge , so if Pfizer admit they didn't test for transmission and that the jab had some harmful side effects why was it pushed on young healthy people at no risk from the virus , this young person caring for someone is totally justified to have serious concerns , the BBC could learn a lot from this woman's courage
0	The only question I'd ask the reporter and anyone else: "How can you be suuuure, the vaccine is safe?"
1	Vaccinatiin rate in "highly vaccinated" countries has fallen drastically. Any effects from vaccinations in 2021 has waned. People who were previously protected by vaccines are not protected anymore and are now therefore dying at a higher rate. This is proof vaccines worked.
1	Breastfeeding mother, vaccinated to pass on antibodies, best for baby's immune system.
0	My doctor is a real doctor. And he's pro vaccine but not when it comes to the Covid 19 vaccine. The difference between the covid 19 and others vaccines is it's a mrna vaccines and they are dangerous.
0	I made the mistake of getting it (Moderna) so I could travel - in Sept of 2021. 38 year old male, never been to doctor for any disease or health related problem. Have now had chest pain for over a year, high bp, constant headaches and had to get put on beta blockers as well as getting stress test. Wish I would have listened to my instincts on this one. I hope all that got it make it through this alive. I'm glad the young lady didn't back down in the face of the smug interviewer.
1	Covid is contagious, it is a threat and vaccines are effective solution to limit this pandemic to make more damages
0	I’m unvaccinated and just got over Covid, I will be the first to tell you that a mandate for vaccination is absolutely bullshit, and violates peoples chance to make decisions for themselves
0	have survived Covid now for three times without any pharmaceuticals imagine that
1	The simple act of getting vaccinated can save lives, and I'm glad to have done my part.
0	I am a 54 yr old female and I have heart palpitations and irregular heartbeats caused by the vaccine.
1	The confirmed results of long covid risk decreasing with vaccination make me hopeful that next-generation ones will really really help. As for treatments, most clinical trials are ongoing so all hope is here
0	Keep getting them boosters .... Im sure the next one will work....
0	He didn’t know what he was finding. At that time they were calling it a vaccine and they probably figured it was the same as all vaccines. They didn’t know it was just a shot with horrible implications. When I first heard of a vaccine I was pumped. It took a year after it was released to realize it was a dangerous shot and not a vaccine.
0	Never got the jab, never will.
1	Boostered!  Got the invite email 00:34, found appointment 09:15, done.  All 3 Moderna.  Feel great!#COVID #vaccination
0	In almost 2 years I know one person that died "with" covid.  I know three who killed themselves, three who died shortly after vaccination/booster, and five that were hospitalized after one of the shots.
0	I believe the specific words being used by literally every world government were "safe and effective".
1	Vaccines have played a pivotal role in extending life expectancy and improving overall public health worldwide
1	The more anti vaxxers there are, the less anti vaxxers there are. Let them have their game of chicken with Charles Darwin.
1	vaccination remains the safest and optimal tool” against infection and death
1	Soon the anti vaxxers claim themselves discriminated like other people in the past.
0	WILL NOT COMPLY ! This is the greatest hoax ever perpetuated on mankind.
0	My buddy's wife almost died 15 minutes after the 2nd jab. The ER doctor said it didn't have anything to do with the jab. The cardiologist said it was 100% the vaxs fault. He said it sure wasn't the first time they had seen such a reaction.
0	Well, You can chooose. GEtting Covid Naturally, Or getting a shot that can give you Miocarditis/face paralisis/blood clots/and auntoimmune defficiency. for the rest of your life.
0	Not one single person who didn't get jabbed regrets their decision
0	no one ever needs a vaccine ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1	I’d love for anti Vaxxers to come up with a better way to solve this mess. And if they truly believe that Covid isn’t real, go and look after those on a Covid ward for a week as a volunteer
0	I like how they ignore literally allllllll of the other evidence in young people. And only relate it to the latest booster. This is strictly damage control
1	I got two Astra Zeneca shots and I didn't feel any pain and no side effects at all.
1	I am vaccinated bc I want to be part of the solution, not part of the problem.
0	How did being vaccinated help either of them?
0	"Died suddenly", with no previous health complaints has occured a few times this past year where I live (one there at the weekend) and nobody's batting an eyelid about it. The general population have been brain washed. We OWE IT to our loved ones to push for an autopsy. We MUST take this psychopathic entity down. We owe it to humanity.
1	#covid19 #coronavirus. Put simply the problem to the World is not that it can kill people. The problem is that up until now unlike the big killers in the World, (starvation, poverty, climate change and war) it kills RICH and poor people. A vaccine will change this.
0	There's so much conflicting information about COVID-19 vaccines. It's hard to know who to believe.
0	A gentleman I know had to have his booster before boarding a cruise ship. Two weeks later he dropped from heart complications with blood clots in his lungs. Another associate received his booster before boarding a plane for a China visit. Soon after his return he also landed in the hospital with heart complications and blood clots.  Just recently a friend was exercising on a tread mill a few weeks after his booster. He currently is in the hospital in a coma from a heart attack. This Friday they may remove him from life support. I could go on for two years back, just sitting here watching the insanity with the commercial’s pushing this snake oil.
0	I am glad I watched this because it helped me realise that the shots are certainly unsafe.
1	The real question is, why is nobody advertising the best vaccine out there: Moderna.  Fizer is too expensive. AZ is a chimp virus with low effectiveness. Too much money and politics in this crisis.
0	I think it’s not that well-tested. So with the kids, we usually get the vaccines. They’ve been out there for a long time and they still have some type of side effects. … So I don’t see how something developed in six months could be totally safe.
1	I work in healthcare and I've been fully vaccinated. I believe in the vaccine and have seen its benefits in my hospital.
0	I’m skeptical at best.
0	Covid 19 is bio terrorism, dont take the vaccine the last major pandemic faded away after two years without vaccinations, trust the human immune system which evolved to be effective against these type of corona viruses over 100s of thousands of years, reclaim your brain stand up against the evil of these private tyrannies.
1	Vaccination programs are essential for global health and security.
1	My mom had vaccine. She is hypertensive, has a heart problem and is a chronic diabetic. When she got the virus, she had running nose for one day. My brother and his wife got the virus, were very ill, got hospitalised for two weeks, and had to take oral steroids for another week. They hadn't taken the vaccine So get the vaccine. Any vaccine is better than no vaccine.
1	I'm glad that I received the new covid shot yesterday. However, I am feeling quite drowsy and boy does my arm hurt! Far worse than the previous covid shots.
1	I pray the vaccine works so things can go back to Normal, hate all the negativity around it.
0	Had both doses of Moderna, after the second dose I broke out in itchy rashes all over my body and they itch so bad it felt like a burning sensation just saying!
1	Favor quote during the pandemic. “The unvaccinated are putting children at risk, because some people are acting like children.” -Stephen Colbert. #VaccinesWork
0	Blood clean no vaccine
1	Pfizer gang represent
0	Where are all the trials that prove this thing has no long term effects.     Oh that's right they're are none.
1	Unvaccinated adults are significantly less likely to adapt other safety methods than their vaccinated counterparts. A majority of unvaccinated adults believe that vaccines pose a greater threat to their health than catching a covid variant while unvaccinated.
1	I would too! I want to keep the people I love safe, so I‘m first in line. Thank you for being so outspoken about this. DFTBA
0	I will wait some years to see how the people who take the vaccine it’s doing and then I will decide.
1	Delighted to receive my  vaccine today. A huge and heartfelt thank you
0	At no time in history has the people forcing others into compliance been the good guys
1	There is a special place for those who use my mother’s death as a vehicle to further their agenda against vaccines and public health interventions.
1	There's no excuse not to get vaccinated if you're eligible. It's free, easy, and could save your life (or someone else's).
0	Biggest mistake of my life was taking the shot to get my wife out of lockdown. 2 years later and I still have heart problems and thrombosis in my legs. F the entire medical mafia.
1	Um I got COVID shots and I survived the whole pandemic with no virus. I only got COVID the year I never had a shot…
0	Unvaccinated and proud.
0	Yea looking like they ready to drop dead, little do ppl know they are falling right in line with the globalist plan of depopulation. The vaccines were just the beginning
0	The twisted evil of using a parent's natural desire to protect their child as leverage to get them to give their child something that seriously harms them.
1	Good news definitely, but July 31st is rough. Going to be a long next 6 months. On top of the long 10 months we've all already endured. We will get through this though.
0	By not taking the jab, I'm 100% safe from side effects and 99% safe from covid.
1	I was hesitant at first, but after researching and talking to my doctor, I'm convinced that getting the COVID-19 vaccine is the right choice.
1	if u choose not to get it thats fine. No need to spread false information. I’ve had flu vaccines for years now and recently the covid vaccine and I’m absolutely fine. And I know in the future I will be fine too.
1	As a retail worker in the UK who won't be eligible for a vaccine until June/July, please get one now if you can
0	I have Myocardises after getting my MRNA. Just waiting now for a law firm to start a class action. They lied to us.
0	I have had, 2 Pfizer shots, 1 Moderna, 1 novax. I get a hot head rush every now and then now, I have not once caught Covid-19. I was sick once in 2022, tested 3 times, came up negative, found out later it was pneumonia not COVID. Now they talking about a 5 booster shot, enough is enough.
0	Turns out they never tested the efficacy at all.
0	Let's be honest; most doctors knew this vaccine was dangerous a couple of years ago. Doctors need to begin speaking out. Better late than never.
1	I am very glad I decided to get vaccinated- I am chronically ill in several ways, including severe asthma and a haywire immune system. I know that I would be one to become severely ill or die if infected, despite being seventeen
1	I took my shot of Jenssen (Johnson & Johnson) + booster from Pfizer and I am perfectly normal.
1	To protect the health of all employees, organizations must employ only persons who have valid proof of being fully vaccinated. No person in my organization wants to be around anyone not fully vaccinated.
1	Antivaxxers after 80% of the population removed themselves as potential vectors of transmission: "See? It went away on its own."
0	Its not just the jabs, the entire health care system has lost all credibility over thr last 4 years
0	Tell That my aunt and nice. Both EXTREMELY hard hit by youth reumathoid arthritis again after 2th Pfizer . Which they got rid of dozens of years ago. Now on high dose prednison for WEEKS!!
1	It's amazing how quickly scientists were able to develop effective vaccines for COVID-19. We're lucky to live in such an advanced age of medicine.
1	Proud to have gotten my vaccine today. It's a big step forward
1	Pray to God to make the COVID-19 Vaccine ready by the end of the year 2020 going into the new year 2021
1	vaccine is secure
0	no thank you I will keep my immune system up to fight any viruses and keep my trust in the Lord !!!!
0	Vaccine is 90% succesful..human immune system is 99.98 succesful Why vaccine is suddenly so important?
0	I did not get the vaccine, and I got covid. I had cold like symptoms for 3-4 days and I've been fine ever since. Now that I've had covid, basically for the next 8 months to a year I probably won't get it again, I'll probably reevaluate the situation then if I want to get the vaccine or not.
1	I am vaccinated and pro-vax
0	I still haven’t gotten any Covid Vaccines
1	I've gotten my booster and glad I did. I feel more relieved than ever!!
0	I NEVER took the jab. I was pressured by my own family, criticized, and bullied but i stood my ground. MY BODY MY CHOICE RIGHT?
0	I'm cautious about new medical interventions like this vaccine
1	Vaccines work, only one way to interpret that.
0	Biden's anger at the unvaccinated made me decide not to get the Jab.
0	If the goal of your video was to convince me to get the jab it had the opposite effect.
0	My VA Doctor advised me not to take the vaccines just because Governments say so Thank God I listened to him
0	Like Ive said elsewhere, they havent hid the fact that they are for mass depopulation and the past 3 years has been the perfect way to go about it so as not to go down in history as some of the most truly evil creatures to ever walk the Earth. Release a modified virus that all except for the sick and the elderly have no cause for concern, but kills the aforementioned group in enough mass numbers as to warrant an untested vaccine that doesnt kill everybody who takes it but kills enough to suit their needs or causes lowered reproduction rates, and within a single generation you have a severely depleted world population without having to fire a single bullet. Its actually pretty ingenious really, truly truly evil, but ingenious nonetheless
1	I hope they find a way to use this tech to teach the body how to fight cancer. In my opinion this is the worst of all diseases.
1	I just got vaccinated. If people want to get vaccinated or not is their business.
0	It's not a vaccine! I don't understand why they keep calling it a vaccine. Call it whatever you want I will not get the jab. I got a flu shot several years ago and ended up getting the flu and was sicker than I ever have before. No shots for me.
0	No. Haven't gotten any vaccine or booster and I haven't been sick at all. Not changing that.
0	I’ve been working in retail throughout the pandemic. If I didn’t get it by now, I’ll take the continued risk of COVID over whatever the hell the vaccine might do.
0	Believe in natural remedies and building up one's own immune system instead of relying on artificial means
1	The stupidity of many homo sapiens is much more worrisome than COVID 19. The Virus will eventually be defeated by a vaccine, but stupidity, a mixture of premeditated ignorance with technological arrogance, will eventually destroy the planet where we live. #coronavirusEspana
0	Even if I die, i will never regret NOT getting the shots. because i didnt get them…
0	I didn't get the first one and I don't date vaccinated women.
1	This study uses VAERS data. That's why you losers never post the study & just post screenshots. Here's a link to the complete study. Additionally, studies (Wong et al., 2022 & Patone et al., 2022) indicate myocarditis risk is higher from COVID19 infection.
0	Am I the only one who doesn’t feel confident about taking a vaccine that was completed in 6 months and has not long term data collected on it.....?
0	the vax didn’t work
0	My husband who is  45 had a mild heart attack last week due to blood clots. He received both doses of Moderna. His dr is perplexed
1	Of course. I’ve never had an issue with any vaccine ever and I know any risks that might be from the vaccine are significantly less than getting Covid
1	If thousands are dying from Covid vaccine in NZ, as a doctor I would know. My colleagues would know.
0	How Have They Hijacked One of Our Body Parts without Our Knowledge or Consent?
1	I don't know if I'm the rarest person, but when I got the Pfizer Vaccine, it gives me energized
1	I am absolutely on board with mandatory vaccination of the child population
1	Feeling very privileged to have recieved my first Covid-19 vaccine!
1	I'm proud that I got an old friend to get the vaccine. He was a bit paranoid about it. When I told him I'd feel terrible if someone found him dead in his home. He's about 75ish
0	Well this hasn't aged well. Today is september 26 2023 and as it turns out the mRNA vaccine has been found in breast milk. Still want the shot?
1	Got my first Pfizer jab about 22 hours ago. Feeling great, no side effects except for a slightly sore arm. Apparently the second vaccine hits harder though with chills fever and fatigue (which is a normal reaction after getting vaccinated).
0	How many unvaccinated children die of a preventable disease because they didnt have the vaccine for it?
0	I am so glad I didn't get the shot!
0	A vaccine that is supposed to be developed over numerous years are now developed within a few months will never be as safe as there will be insufficient time provided to monitor longer term side effects of vaccine and accurately compare with placebo (given injection but without actual vaccine but only glucose sugar water). Quickly vaccinating the population just to pick up economy is never a good idea unless the vaccine is absolutely safe through long term testing. I hope the safety of the citizens are placed priority! A weak trait of most Singaporean is kiasu and therefore easily pushed into vaccinating simply by seeing news like vaccination running out or first come first serve. Be cautious and have your own judgement. Read up historical reports before acting.
1	Is there any research yet on the number of unnecessary deaths caused by antivaxx propaganda?
1	"Vaccines are saving lives" meanwhile romania being the least vaccinated and also least infected country in the whole europe..
1	I hate that we have come to a time when we shut up a Doctor and tell them they are wrong because we have "investigated"
1	Of course, I will get vaccinated. The risk is extremely small, we're talking 0.00 something percent.
0	The Vaccinated - Already paid the price, its not in Doge or Bitcoin - we don't even know what the price is - but i am sure we will find out
0	Developed too fast. How can it be safe? I'll pass.
1	Anti vaxxers are so passionate about this topic because it’s the first time their lives they’ve felt so intelligent 🤣🤣
0	I was just about to get the vaccine and now I definitely never will!
1	I hope we are able to eradicate these diseases that plague humanity so all people can live easier.
0	Biggest psyops ever perpetrated on human mankind. Great work john.
1	Never got coivd but I think my coworker lied to me about the vaccine making me sterile.
0	I have several friends who I've known for 20+ years, so I know their history. As soon as they took the vaccine, their bodies went haywire. I didn't take it (and never will), and I'm just fine. The other 8 people I know who have had no health symptoms - all unvaccinated. Although some of the vaccinated people I know haven't had ill effects, it's about one per week now - who ends-up getting shingles, or needs ankle braces (a common side effect from the vaccine). I work at a medical clinic, so 'm thinking - I know a little bit more about this - than your average Joanne.
0	100% safe from side effects, 99.98% safe from COVID death. I think I’ll stay unvaccinated
0	Vaccine's a big gamble. Don't trust it.
1	The morons who called the vaccine the "Fauci Ouchie" dying while I picture Dr. Fauci taking a deeeep breath and being happy to be alive.
1	Covid vaccination must be made mandatory for all Americans no exceptions. There’s just no other way.
1	Bunch of pansy borderline anti Vaxxers. There is no long term effect of Pfizer vaccine, kiddos. The government is not out to get you.. this is a global event, not a US government conspiracy. Although quick, It wasn’t rushed. Pfizer is safe and likely the only difference compared to other Pfizer vac is the rna sequence. Go get your shots yuh bunch of scartie pants
1	I don’t do well with vaccines at all lol I get sick pretty much every time but I still will get this vaccine. We need as much people to get it as possible for herd immunity to be effective!
1	One of my house mate said today "I prefer covid instead of rushed vaccine" unbelievable.
1	Vaccines are instrumental in preventing outbreaks of infectious diseases.
1	Vaccines are truly lifesavers.
1	Health care worker here. Thank you and thank you to everyone for wearing masks, social distancing and for getting vaccinated (when the time is appropriate). We will get through this, together
1	A vacination makes much sence as it helps to relieve the burden on hospitals.
1	Getting vaccinated is a social responsibility to protect our communities.
0	Beware of fake news!
1	The covid vaccine knew what it was doing cuz I suffered a little but imagine if i wasn’t vaccinated hmm
1	The vaccine should be mandatory.
0	cant believe these sheep still take more shots…
0	I know one person who died of heart attack at 38, and another one who got a blood clot in brain, both were healthy prior to vaccine.
1	I've done my research, I trust science, the vaccine is safe & effective.
1	i wasnt feeling to good today so i went to my nearest clinic got my covid and flu vaccine , docs tells i should get well soon
0	Safe and effective, tell that to the people who died or are disabled.
0	Vaccines usually take a decade or more of research. No one knows what the side effects may be of an expedited vaccine.
0	Thank You Dr. Fauci. Im fully vaccinated but I fear these idiots in Idaho that won't mask or get the vaccine.   I am truly grateful and appreciative for you and the hard work you do for us. I've made sure my whole family is vaccinated .
1	I just lost a cousin to it. He didn't go easily. It was a very long, painful struggle for him. He was anti vax to the end.
1	Sooooo whos not vaxxed? Shame on u
1	I see getting vaccinated as a responsibility to my community. By doing my part, I'm helping to create a safer environment for everyone, especially those who may be more vulnerable to severe illness
0	I had so many family members try to tell me that I was reason that COVID persisted because of not getting vaccinated. They are not saying that now.
0	Every single vaccine in existence is a contaminated dangerous gene therapy: WAKE UP.
1	I heard pfizer is the best vaccine so im going to get that one
0	Other studies not conducted by a vaccine manufacturer may say different.
1	Every vaccine dose is a life saved, a family protected, and a community made stronger. From early childhood vaccines and boosters to COVID-19, your entire family needs vaccinations to stay healthy and prevent diseases.
0	What about the doctors and scientists who tell us vaccines are doing more harm than good?  Jimmy is out of his element.  Vaccines cause autism in some children...that's kind of a reason.  Education is the key!
0	I believe in natural immunity rather than vaccines
0	I'd rather take my chances with COVID-19 than with the potential side effects of the vaccine.
1	Pros are you don’t get horribly sick and/or die.  Cons are you might feel sluggish after few days of getting it.  Edit: another Pro is it helps protect your baby from covid. Covid is becoming a leading cause of death in children.
0	Big Pharma profits off our fear. they create diseases to sell their so-called 'cures'!
1	Researchers said the risk of cerebral venous thrombosis from the #Covid was approximately: 10 times higher compared to messenger RNA vaccines. 8 times higher than compared to the  #oxfordastrazeneca vaccine
0	We currently have thousands of men, women and children DEAD across th UK and severely injured from the Covid 19 vaccines
1	I trust in the science behind vaccines
1	as soon as i’m able i’m going to get vaccinated:)
0	This documentary sickened me to my core. And further convinced me that I would never take it.
0	If ONLY 25% don't trust, how do they explain only 3% of americans have taken this year's booster?? That's the latest number I've seen.
0	So many got the v juice. Lowest pregnancy rates ever in our country over last 18 months yet we know when storms come and people stay home for a week, pregnancy rates increase. Not in this case
0	fuck joe biden and fuck covid
0	I would rather die than have a vaccine 😌
1	My kids are vaccinated because I appreciate that I have the luxury of not watching my children die from preventable diseases-
0	My decision not to get the vaccine is based on the fact that neither the Govt nor the pharmaceutical companies are held liable if there's and adverse reaction to it.
0	BEST QUIZ EVER!   1. What vaccine doesn't stop you getting the disease it's supposed to protect you from ?  2. What vaccine doesn't stop you getting the disease then suddenly works perfectly when issued with a passport to enable people to gather together?   3. What pandemic silences the worlds most qualified immunologist if they see problems with the vaccines they themselves took? Even the inventors of the said vaccine!   4. What vaccine contributed to an increase in deaths of that disease more so than the countries less vaccinated?   5. What vaccine, that's supposed to be safe, has immunity from prosecution and hides trial data for 95 years?
1	This vaccine sounds amazing! I can't wait for you to get it!
0	More jabs more problems
1	I'm retired until there's a vaccine. Be smart stay safe people.
1	The lack of awareness about vaccine is concerning. Some have pointed out how people are getting positive for SARS-CoV-2 even after vaccination, vaccines train the immune system to recognize and fight a virus, reducing the severity of infection. It is NOT a cure, they provide protection. Infections may still occur, but symptoms are often milder. Studies have shown how COVID-19 Infection are associated with cardiovascular disease, but none conclusively pointing to COVID vaccine.
1	Anti Vax people think they're so woke. I ashamed I know a few
1	It's not just mRNA. Adenoviral vector vaccines were produced on a similar timeframe. It's that the red tape was cut out, and regulatory agencies around the world parallelized and streamlined their testing and approval processes.
1	This is the trial I have been involved in since August. I look forward to the release of the vaccine to help humanity.
1	I believe that collective action through vaccination can end this pandemic.
1	staying up-to-date with vaccines for COVID-19 is part of being a good community member
1	Just got my second vaccine dose today and I am now in bed with body chills and my head is on fire. Felt the symptoms about 10-12 hours later. I cannot wait for this bloody Covid to be over! 🥵
0	I’ll still never forgive those who demonized people for not having the ‘Jab.’
1	Thank you for sharing this! As a healthcare professional I hear some of my own employees come in talking about “research” taken from FB and other social media and it can be so, so harmful.
1	Wait, but there’s a few things. 1. Someone being allergic to a vaccine doesn’t mean that vaccines don’t work, and they kill children. There have been plenty of instances of people dying from vaccines, but, compared to each other, kids dying from polio is not only a lot worse, but a lot more common from anti vaxers. https://www.cdc.gov/measles/cases-outbreaks.html Even the cdc, THE CDC, have concluded that not only have there been a substantial increase of measles cases in the US, 31 states mind you, since the 1990s. 2. Would you rather have your child die within six years from a disease that has been considered eradicated until the Karens decided basic well-being is bullshit, or have an allergic reaction to a shot. I don’t feel like much explanation or elaboration is needed. Please for the love of god just do some research, it took me a 2 minute google search to find loads of reliable websites. [World Health Organization ](https://www.who.int/westernpacific/emergencies/polio-outbreak-in-the-philippines) [CDC on polio](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/polio_reports.html)
0	The vaccine doesn't guarantee immunity, so what's the point of getting it?
0	"I don't trust the government's handling of the pandemic, so I question the safety of the vaccine."
0	I believe that the risk of COVID-19 is overblown and doesn't justify vaccination.
0	Biggest mistake of my life was taking the shot to get my wife out of lockdown. 2 years later and I still have heart problems and thrombosis in my legs. F the entire medical mafia.
0	Covid shots are useless and dangerous
1	I feel that the Anti-Vax mindset is a genuine danger to humanity
0	The potential for vaccine-related injuries and deaths is a significant reason for hesitancy.
0	Dang it is 2023 and sadly, it seems like she is right. Young people suddenly dying. :( on news, and some of the people I know. Two doctors in our town died after being jabbed. What they are doing to humanity is scary.
0	No one. 5 boosters later and vaccinated people are getting it left and right. Doesn't take a genius to figure out how much that helps.
0	Do not get the vaccine
0	New fall arsenal of bio weapons!
1	Anti-Vaxers have already made up their mind.
1	Very well explained. But based on this information, I’ll wait until the efficacy of the jab remains at 100% with no boosters required. Similar to the childhood ones.
1	A woman I worked with resigned her 90k/year job last November after vaccines were mandated. She gave up her great job instead of getting vaxxed. She died of COVID this last Friday. She left behind a husband and 3 teenage children. What a fucking shame.
1	Really awkward for Covidiots. They want normality but won't take the vaccine because they've spend the last few weeks talking to their mate Dave who read something online.
1	today, i got my vaccine j&j, later i felt tired and snoring in my arm.. wish good health for everyone..
0	I'm unvaxxed and have never had covid while being tested weekly. You're on shot 5. At what point do you think maybe it's not worth it?
1	My mother will not even entertain the notion of taking the vaccine because according to her, Bill Gates has something evil and sinister to do with it. What? I have no idea but that's another story. I asked her where she saw this nonsense and quite naturally, she watched it on a YouTube video. I asked her if it bothered her to use her computer to watch videos because Bill Gates really did indeed have something to do with the design of the operating system of the computer that she watches on. I just heard crickets.
1	It has to be MANDATORY COVID19 VACCINATION WITHOUT EXCEPTIONS to avoid more infections and deaths.
0	About as safe as.Russian Roulette
0	Still haven’t had my first dose. Doing great. No long term effects from an untested vaccine coming my way.
1	Anti vaxxers are sub humans. Why even acknowledge their existence? Shun them, they're a virus on humanity
0	The production of the COVID-19 vaccine at an unprecedented speed evoked the fear of skipping steps that would compromise vaccine safety.
0	Trump has to be voted out or else our children would never be able to see their grandparents!! Vote Him OUT!
1	So did I; I chose AZ. How fortunate we both are to have a vaccine that could have saved the lives of millions of people around the world if they'd had the same privilege.
0	I'm still proudly unvaccinated.
0	One of the best life decisions I made for me and my family was NOT to take any shots of any covid vaccines regardless the great panic and great social pressure against the unvaccinated
1	I got the vaccine already and I feel fine !!! Get the vaccine when it’s accessible guys. Let’s get back to our lives
1	Thank you! We cannot achieve herd immunity without vaccines. It didn’t happen with smallpox, polio, pertussis, etc, and it won’t happen with COVID. Thinking of others, like young children, people being treated for cancer, and immunocompromised people deserve to be safe. This is our responsibility, not just for ourselves, but for those around us.
1	Got my third Covid vaccination yesterday.  So thankful for the health care we receive in Canada.  I feel like garbage every time I get my shot, but I am still thankful.
1	I chose to get vaccinated because I want to live my life in the present.
0	Can someone tell me what the hell is inside the vaccine because I don't know and for that reason you can keep it
1	for people saying this is why they’re not getting it.. this literally means it’s working
0	Still pushing the shots here in Canada as well, right down to very young children. It is unimaginable and unforgivable .
0	I'm glad I trust my gut feeling, the pharma industry is absolutely evil. I have companies still denying me just because I'm unvaccinated, its crazy
0	Why would he regret taking a shot that arguably has more downside risks than potential benefits?
0	If I was the drug companies, I’d say 20 vaccine doses were required. The government is paying me for the drugs. And they are making things mandatory. Free money! Right!? Absolutely no conflict of interest.
1	As a responsible adult, I make sure to get vaccinated to protect myself and those around me.
1	The aliens are trying to get us ready for harvest.
1	When I was vaccinated, I was feeling good.
0	I was 49 (UK male) when COVID hit and I felt under so much pressure from everyone to get the jabs, including my then 43 year old female partner. My health is not good. I just could not force myself to do it as I thought it was rushed out and so many drug giants were involved and they are all money driven. I tried my best to avoid getting COVID, but I did get it in the end. I was quite ill for a week, but not hospitalised. My partner had it at the same time, but she had 2 jabs and was nearly as ill as I was. I have had some issues since then with random pain around the heart muscle and shortness of breath for many months, but I am not convinced that this was COVID. I am still unvaccinated.
0	It is not obligated yet we are not happy with this vaccination imposition. #CitizensAreTheState
1	This is not passive-aggressive, it’s really aggressive-aggressive. Almost telling that the 4 horsemen of apocalypse will come for the antivax 🤣
0	everyone else in my family wanted to get it except for me. i wrote a WHOLE ESSAY (literally the only time i have written an essay by choice) about the negatives of getting the vaccine. unfortunately, i still had to get it.
1	Just by leaving those who are anti-vaxers and anti-maskers alone, will by natural selection make America great again.
0	I tried googling 'how to boost my immune system naturally,' and apparently eating kale and drinking green smoothies works better than shots.
0	Just the fact that you can't sue drug companys makes me not want to take the jab.
1	I know vaccinated people spread it much less in identical situations
1	Here is a great reason to get vaccinated. Long Covid otherwise known as Post Covid Syndrome or Long Haul Covid doesn’t go away. I got Covid in March of 2020 and have been almost completely incapacitated for 22 months now. It would be wonderful if you made a similar short documentary on the people not getting better for years.
0	Our pure blood is going to be highly sought after in the future once the true affects of this vaccine are brought to light
0	My mom got auto immune condition after vaccine of two doses. Our life has become hell.
0	We are unvaccinated and still uninfected, as far as we know.
0	I've had covid twice, barely noticed it and it's not worth the effort to get vaccinated for me personally
1	I appreciate how the vaccines have been tested on diverse populations, which reassures me of their effectiveness across different demographics.
1	I have gotten every covid shot that I could get my hands on, and im still here living and breathing. Mind you, I never got covid19 to begin with, but my wife had it, and I never got it, but I'm not taking any chances
1	And Covid still kills the unvaccinated
0	I haven't really been sick since 1977. I've never had a flu vaccine and definitely not this new BS.
1	The cool thing is, because the newest COVID-19 vaccines use mRNA to confer immunity to the coronavirus (as the video mentions), they have minimal chance of actually making a person sick (even someone with a weakened immune system). The fact that everyone can get vaccinated against COVID-19 safely and without risk of illness means that the pandemic could very well be over before we know it!
0	I truly don't understand how me getting the vaccine would be helpful to others. If others want to be protected, wear a mask/get the vaccine yourself?
1	The FDA has a more trusted source of medical information that essential oil companies.  The FDA has falsified results, but not always. Most medicine and vaccinations are proven to work multiple times.  Essential oils have no medical proof at all.  Do you realize the studies that "proved" that vaccines cause autism had falsified results?  Essential oils eat away plastics. Talking about dangerous. They promote it anyway because of profits!
1	I just wanna say, I am lucky to be fully vaccinated.
0	its waste of time
0	Whether it is safe or not i believe all humans should have the right to refuse the vaccine, blaming people for not taking the vaccine just makes you a extremist.
1	I knew a guy, anti-vaxxer, died of covid last week.
0	I was suddenly diagnosed with chronic kidney disease after i got my vaccine
1	this is not true. Since the 1980s autism has been on an exponential uprise, and this time period also happens to coincide with the exact time period when vaccines started being widely used. Is this not at all suspicious to you?
0	It's so safe it's exempt from liability! Wow
1	Oh have no worries. You got an amazing vaccine. Have fun (wait for the vaccine to kick in first though
1	I was in hospital in October last year for 2 months, 21 days in icu in a coma on a ventilator in Australia. Horrendous experience. My parents in their 70s had received one dose when tested positive and they were mildly ill, mum slightly sicker than dad. I was not vaccinated and nearly died. I was wrong in my fears of vaccines. Whatever conspiracy theory you believe, this was my reality. Currently awaiting my 3rd dose.
1	The light at the end of the tunnel is brighter with each vaccination. Proud to do my part in this historic effort.
1	Saying you can breathe away covid is like saying you can walk off polio
0	Trusting the FDA which is manned by rotating employees of Big Pharma is like trusting the fox to guard the henhouse.
0	This was funny lmaooo imagine trusting another human being without doing ur own research   no thanks im anti vax until i myself research nd deem safe for every single jab for MY KIDS
0	I would be terrified of being amongst the initial batch of people receiving the vaccine.
1	Once again... The vaccine does not give you covid
1	I benefitted greatly from being vaccinated, THEREFORE, I will not vaccinate my children! I just don’t get it
1	Somebody really needs to teach anti vaxxers about adverse reactions to OTC meds and "natural remedies." Asprin will kill you before this stuff does
0	I still haven’t gotten any Covid Vaccines, and I won’t
1	Great news!  Officially the beginning of the end.  I hope provinces release vaccination number dashboards like they have for covid cases. More data is always good.
1	I was able to travel and see my family again safely thanks to the vaccine.
1	I took a jab last Saturday. Surprisingly, it was painless, although it made me very sleepy for few days.
0	AstraZeneca questioned over data used in Covid-19 vaccine trial. #AstraZeneca #COVID19 #COVID19Vaccine #Pfizer #SputnikV #finance #investing #investments
1	I'd rather have a temporary discomfort from a shot than risk a serious illness or spreading the virus
0	That vaccine is really make my life miserable. I have lots of pain last 1yr.Plus I got pppd problem. I guess this vaccine has lots of long term side effects.
1	we trust you hope you're right and we can avoid covid from vaccinating.
1	Just got my first Pfizer shot yesterday, nothing bad so far except for sore arm. I'll see in a few days how things are going.
1	Blaming vaccines because your child had a negative reaction to them is like blaming cheese for being lactose intolerant. It’s nobody’s fault. It’s the luck of the draw.
0	My friend is vaccinated. He died of heart failure. He is only 40 or 41 years old.
1	I'm a healthy young adult, and I thought I didn't need to get vaccinated. But then I got COVID-19, and it was the sickest I've ever been. I'm so glad I'm recovered, but I know it could have been much worse if I hadn't been vaccinated.
0	Natural immunity is the best for me ️ stay strong and don't be coerced into taking the injection
0	Until there’s been long term testing I’m going to pass
1	Amazing! Look at the joy!!! The smiles!!! The sudden great news!!! The vaccine is finally coming!!!
0	The amount of relief I feel that I didn't get vaccinated, even though I was pressured by almost every member of my family, is absolutely indescribable! I feel sorry for those who got it though. Best of luck, they're definitely gonna need it.
0	I'm just bothered by the speed, I'd like to wait awhile to see if I can trust it.
1	yes apparently the answer is yes now lol. Vaccination is safe enough.
0	He had shares in one of  the Vaccine companies, maybe he should have announced his conflict of interest before he answered the question.
1	Vaccines are not the enemy; they're the solution. Let's stop the drama and get jabbed for a safer world.
0	This vaccine is dangerously rushed
1	Just got Covid middle of October, had the booster nearly three weeks before, my symptoms were mild and sickness short. My roommate on the other hand did not get a booster and was suffering really hard for it, hit him pretty hard. Vaccines work!
1	a vaccine IS early treatment
1	Raise your hand if you're grateful for vaccines
0	It's like he has a large stake in a vaccine company so is looking out for his family profits. But of course, that wouldn't happen.
0	vaccine advocates are ignoring valid conerns.
1	Seeing some concerns about the vaccine's lasting power, but remember, most of our common vaccines hold up well over time. A few boosters down the line is a small price to pay for getting back to normal.
0	Just don't force me to take them and I am happy.
1	Well here’s hoping for the best, the human spirit has been strong, those who medically need it most should get it first, I’m a big boy I can wait till it’s my turn.
0	The media/govt has to create case and fatality numbers to make a constant fear, by mass testing all workers, students, etc so it drives up positive “cases” and be labeling every death as Covid saying it’s “with Covid”. This idea of kids getting the shot could be scary premise.
1	You cannot go to an American school without getting your vaccination shots. Pretty great Mexico does this too.
1	The vaccine works. Saves you from ICU admission and death.
1	I love DeSantis.  He was one of the 1st governors to fight against the mandate and Florida did not mandate the shot.  He's our hero.
1	Your all talk. By the time anything gets done thousands of people will die. People are going hungry. Stimulous my ass. We can't even get tested. No plan for food to sick seniors. Your all talk. No vaccine in 1 yr. We are all prisoners of war. #COVID19 #quack
1	I’m a public school teacher, I am 100% going to be taking a vaccine as soon as possible to make sure I don’t spread anything unintentionally to my students or colleagues. When we have the tools to stop suffering, we need to use them.
0	I have never had Covid but took a reaction after one MRNA vaccine and am now disabled
0	never had the poison never will
1	Uh vaccine help you body to practice fighting germs and they may contain acids but smallppox went away with vaccines so that proves my point that vaccines work
0	First the vaccination was suppose to prevent you from getting covid then they had to switch it up to the “ herd immunity “ because people who were vaxed was getting covid now it’s “ so your symptoms won’t be as bad “ GO TO HELL
0	I'll keep saying it, I am not getting an incredibly rushed vaccine for a virus with a 99% survival rate without knowing the long term effects.
0	Now, do a story on how many young “vaxed” people are dropping dead suddenly…  Do a story on the rise in unexplained deaths
1	The only reason we can have this debate is because of how well vaccines work
1	Vaccination is a triumph of human progress. Let's celebrate science!
0	Ahhhhhh she mutated into a dinosaur
0	I'm 30 with no underlying conditions the science says I do not need the vaccine. So I'll go by the science
1	Vaccination is the best way to create the right conditions for herd immunity to develop
0	I'm pretty sure the only reason vaccines exist is because drug companies needed an excuse to print more colorful brochures
1	Agree with all of this. People who refuse should all move to one place ...
0	I feel bad for those people negatively affected by the vaccine
0	Unvaccinated and proud.
0	My mom told me never to take candy from a stranger.
1	If you don't get it, you are literally a walking variant factory for the virus.
1	yes, vaccinated will eventually get covid but they are 10 times less likely to end up in my Emergency Department.
0	Tiredness
1	Let's hope the poor woman doesn't get too badly abused by the anti vax morons
0	This didn't convince me to get a covid vaccine, but it did prove that education and intelligence are two different things
1	The vaccines are more likely to prevent a severe case than they are to prevent transmission. So it is possible you got it a second time.
1	I got the 3 shots and I didn't get sick any time. I'm from Brazil. Here the vaccination was slow at the beginning, but now we are almost finishing!
1	I was called a heathen and demon possessed because I said I wanted to take the COVID vaccine
0	By not taking the jab, I'm 100% safe from side effects and 99% safe from covid.
1	Roll call for vaccines – always there, always effective. Protecting our communities.
0	The government has overstated the efficacy of the vaccine and apparently understated the risks.  Why?  Follow the money.
0	Shame on those jabbing people with their 13th life saving experimental mRNA jab.
1	During the current epidemic, vaccines are the best weapon
0	Not vaccinated. Never had covid. Worked in hospital in the south west entire time with and around covid patients. All of my colleagues who are vaccinated have had the virus in varying severity.
0	i get it but what if 2 of these variants of vaccines are injected into a human body? what is going to happen?
0	Pass Pass Pass
1	I got my 2nd shot from Moderna. I am so glad I finally got it!
0	Nope my friend died because of the vaccine and 7 people I know are still fighting because of it.
0	Good for him to refuse this untested poison.
0	It's interesting that feeling off, is considered long COVID and having a definite sever inflammatory response after the vaccine (with no symptoms, even after being infected before) is being considered as not clear enough to relate it out report it by most Drs.
0	I didn't vaccinated and very thankful to God
1	Every person must have access to a COVID-19 #vaccine that is safe, effective and timely. States have a collective responsibility to use all available means to facilitate faster and more equal access to vaccines worldwide
0	Has anybody here lost someone they know after taking covid 19 vaccine?
1	A salute to the vaccinated!
1	I've tried so hard to explain to people here (Mexico) why it doesn't matter which vaccine they get and that they should get vaccinated at the earliest opportunity, but some people is so afraid that they don't listen!
1	As an American vaccinated healthcare worker, I don’t understand how this level of selfishness arrogance is possible. I frequently think about exactly what you are saying here, and it’s one of the saddest parts of this whole thing to me. The privilege to not care about others is disgusting and unconscionable. I hope for you that vaccines come more swiftly very soon.
0	I've heard rumors about the government using vaccines to control the population. It's scary to think about.
0	When President Joe Biden offered an absolute guarantee that people who get their COVID-19 vaccines are completely protected from infection, sickness and death from the coronavirus might be some of the missinformation that makes people no longer have the urge to get the vaccine.
1	Everyone in my fam got the vaccine. Zero regrets, just relief
0	THANK GOD I DID NOT GET THE VACCINE
1	Vaccines are a crucial tool in controlling the spread and severity of the virus. #ControlTheSpread #VaccineTool
1	#airlines #airline #covid #VaccineMandate @cnn  The point of requiring vaccination for all air travel is that it would end the fights over masks on planes even if it shifts to the airport. Vaccine mandate would filter out the crazies.
1	My answer is also yes. I am leaping at the chance to get this vaccine. I miss working in entertainment/performing arts, we have been on an indefinite pause of anything in-person since March and it makes me feel like a failure for the degree and career I chose. I’m lucky that I don’t have to go out often and be exposed to the virus, but gosh I want my livelihood & life back and I want everyone to be safe.
1	I’ll be taking like 20 of these all at once
1	I'll do something really radical and listen to the scientists and medical experts. The vaccine is safe!
1	Vaccines have been instrumental in eradicating deadly diseases throughout history, showcasing their effectiveness
0	This trend was the specific reason I did not get vaccinated.   As a scientist, I couldn’t understand how or why such an experimental treatment could be distributed without looking at the long term effects.   I’m not against medicine. I’m a man of data. As more time progressed, this trend started to appear.   It was not a risk I was willing to take, despite their fear mongering around every corner. It’s been a lonely road, but one I’m glad I took.
1	So happy you were able to get vaccinated!!
0	I'm skeptical of the motives behind pushing everyone to get vaccinated.
1	Can we just skip the 2 years of anti-vaxer controversy and just move on without them? I don’t want to revisit this stupidity every day
1	been fully vacinated for months nw doing fine
1	I'm proud of our healthcare system and the way it has prioritized vaccine distribution to protect the vulnerable.
0	People should not be forced to get anything like I was.
1	95 percent effective. I don't think the most positive thinking people thought we would get THAT good of a vaccine in such short time.
1	I am very grateful to be living in a time in which less than 2 years after first hearing about a world wide epidemic, millions of people are now vaccinated with vaccines that use a brand new technology.  God bless modern medicine.
1	Congratulations, my wife has an autoimmune disease and her Doctor said she may not be able to get the vaccine, so we need as many people to take it to attain herd immunity and help others in her position.
1	Before my talk with the doctor I was anti vax. I'm so happy that eventually I decided my doctor was more educated than myself.
1	The COVID-19 vaccine is a vital tool to save lives and prevent the spread of the virus. I got vaccinated to be part of the solution.
0	My daughter (who became a liberal during college) had two babies post vax. Both babies born deaf and 3 year old showing signs of autism. Breaks my heart. My very healthy conservative dad was conned into the jab by his Doctor died of a stroke last February. Just sickening.
1	Any news on a vaccine specific to JN.1?          Thanks for all you do!
1	Great. Going back to work next week in the ER after 7 months on disability/maternity leave. Sounds like this is going to be fun.
0	I'm not an anti-vaxxer but a vaccine developed in 6-12months is giving me doubts.
0	I've seen cases where vaccinated individuals still contracted and spread the virus.
1	"The only reaction I had was fatigue and a bit of a headache. This is completely normal."
0	It's poison and it will make you sick in time , it's dangerous and not safe at all
0	Itching at the injection site
0	Oh no...y'all are doing exactly whats needed. My issue is this... The regular influenza has killed 18,000+ this flu season, and were halfway thru it. What has covid-19 killed in the USA ? There is no vaccine for any of the flu viruses from the past 20 years. Too much extremism
1	it would work, the majority would take the vaccine... I really don't get what's the big deal here in taking it, you are literally stoping a virus which some poeple for some reason compare it to the flu even tho it's alot more infecsious than the flu.
0	Destroy that vaccine. Ban it. Make the stuff illegal.
0	My neighbor died from a massive heart attack the day after she got the vaccine. She was a healthy and active 58 year old woman with no prior heart condition.
1	Just imaging how many it could have saved.
0	Dizziness
0	My family doctor took the shot and he got COVID. In the hospital for one month , then physical therapy. Ha almost died. I ask him about taking the shot since I have heart disease from exposure to Agent Orange, he said he could not recommend it but my choice. Got covid in 2020 and 2021...like a cold.
0	I have several friends who I've known for 20+ years, so I know their history. As soon as they took the vaccine, their bodies went haywire. I didn't take it (and never will), and I'm just fine.
0	Have you taken your 5th booster yet? Pfizer needs more money you know, be a good little sheep and follow the flock.
0	Problem isn't which vaccine, problem are ingredients in the vaccine that shouldbe known like ingredients in food.
0	My mother in law has deteriorated so bad constant headaches, rashes, and can’t remember Anything after her shots. Very active and mentally smart prior. Doctors deny it was jabs some nurses say opposite but afraid to say otherwise. I have zero trust in most doctors today.
0	What happens if a person that already is suffering from covid and takes the vax?!
0	Better to be a PureBlood than one of the Unclean who's got the injection
0	Covid vaccine is just a normal flu plus the vaccine is of no effect
0	Is COVID really nasty, though? I keep hearing there's a huge risk of ending up hospitalized and dying, but the data doesn't support that.
0	Good for Texas, basics freedoms being protected...unlike the unscientific logic that the unvaccinated are a threat to the vaccinated. Just like the unscientific logic that those who have recovered from Covid do not have immunity....it is baffling but not surprising given the incompetence of this administration that continues to lie to the American people.....it’s endless and shameful.
1	I got vaccinated for the safety of my loved ones. It's a small sacrifice for a big impact.
1	I'm inspired by the stories of resilience and hope that vaccination brings
1	I had my first dose of #Moderna on March 11th.  Second dose is scheduled for April 12th.  Feeling great
1	scheduled my parents’ vaccine and i feel so much lighter
1	Got my second dose about a month ago. Nothing bad happens and it works really well.
1	I like my life without being deathly ill.
1	Did COVID/flu together last month. Having covid was unpleasant and I’m not eager to do it again.
0	Please don't take the vaccine guys
0	Hey remember that time where you almost died of polio? Oh wait you didnt, ya know why? Because people got VACCINATED.
0	The narrator explains that the MrNA is broken down. The narrator says nothing about the compounds used to package and transport the mRNA into the cell in the first place, or what eventually happens to the proteins created, or what the error rate of transcription might be, or what kind of errors can result or their effects, or what the chance of getting a bad batch of vaccine is, or what happens to the spike proteins which aren't engulfed. It seems like these questions or any indications of their answers are scrubbed from the internet.
0	"Recently, Pfizer stated that they didn't know if the vaccine was going to work against Covid. It's obvious that any emergency vaccine would have irregularities from start to finish."
0	So you take vaccine and still have to keep mask on and social muthaflucken distancing and everything still closed. So answer is well fluxk you poisonous fauci and bill gates devilish vaccine. If it doesnt do shot why take it.
0	"Vaccine research" Lmao most of them ignored the fact that MRNA technology is just being used meaning that at this rate it's experimental.
1	I appreciate the convenience and accessibility of COVID-19 vaccination centers.
1	Only a month or so ago I got 2 shots of Moderna with zero side effects, except a mildly sore arm for a few hours. Everyone is different
0	I kind of do. I was the only one in my entire family who did not have the vaccine at the time when it became mandatory to take. I was literally peer pressured into taking it cause I had no choice at that point. Took it, didn't enjoy that I had to take vaccine but to me, I feel I would've ended up okay without it
1	Here in New Zealand (where COVID is completely under control, life has been back to normal since November and the death toll is 26), the government is contemplating restricting who can do what in public unless they have proof that they've been vaccinated. So yeah, the anti-vaxxers can refuse inoculation but they'll have to give up their social lives. Great idea.
1	Remember it's not just the deaths, it's the potentially worse outcomes of the disease. It's the permanent damage that covid could cause to bodies which is also significantly lowered by the vaccine.
1	So they say to take the vaccine because it protects against covid, so why in the hell cant I sit inside a restaurant without the vaccination or even go into a store, without a mask if people are vaccinated? I dont get this logic. People are retarded 🤦♂️
0	Covid isn’t the problem. It’s the jab that is ruthless bro.
1	Humanity is starting to take some big steps against the virus now.
0	Stay unvaxxed, and preserve your natural immunity, and your circulatory system. The vaxxed have been in a perpetual state of illness for the past three years, and have had Covid multiple times. The unvaxxed might get the sniffles once every five years, and many of us have never had Covid. Good luck with sorting through the lies.
1	Just scheduled my vaccine appointment! Excited to do my part in ending this pandemic
1	My new fall tradition… early October flu and covid shots.
0	The fact that publication still reference ivermectin as primarily used on "animals" shows how biased their reporting is.
1	I have absolutely no pity for any of them, none. Honestly I don’t think they deserve to receive medical treatment when they eventually do get sick. They made the choice to refuse preventative measures or to take precautions. I feel bad for those who they infected and killed.
0	I am an 68 year old woman. The last time I was hospitized was in 1960, right after the Polio vaccine , I developed Viral Encephalitis post Chicken Pox! I NEVER take the flu vaccine, rarely got the flu. If I did get the flu ,I treated it with Homeopathic remedies. I was a US Navy Nurse Corps scholarship student in college. I left nursing, got an Honorable Discharge and became a Special Education teacher for 37 years! When I retired from teaching I had 300 Unused Sick Days. I take ZERO prescription drugs. I use ONLY vitamins & some herbs. I am recovering from Covid-19. The very first time I ever got it! I have relatives who were vaxed and had Covid 19 three times!!!!! I didn't get vaxed! When I got Covid 19 , I was NEVER hospitized. I was given a drug to reduce nausea! I am recovering at home!
1	The vaccine gives me hope for the end of the pandemic.
0	Guys this is an untested vaccine with mRNA which has never been used before. They tried to develop a mRNA drug and it failed in the early 2000’s. I am definitely waiting this one out, thank you very much.
0	No one’s doctor is going to advise any patient not to get the death-jab. Doctors have been threatened with loss of their licenses for doing so. Doctors have been “dissuaded” from reporting adverse events. Doctors know when their patients have died from the jab, but they call it a “mysterious” reason or try to pin it on something else.
1	Got my vaccine sticker and wearing it proudly
1	I'll get another booster and be glad to have avoided COVID so far.
0	They shouldn't give him any until every other state in the union gets there since they claim that it's a  hoax
0	So what am I supposed to run and get it now because he got it they fucks me up 😂
1	get vaccine as early as possible
1	Vaccines are an incredible thing and I'm grateful that we have them
0	Got vaccinated from peer pressure. Ruined my life. If you’re healthy like I was I would say skip it.  I’m miserable now
1	A lot of people at my school are against the vaccine. It feels good to be one of the few that’s getting it.
0	We have no idea what the long term effects are.
0	When's not getting the shot supposed to kill me and everyone around me?
0	DON’T get the jab!!
1	I've had every Covid-19 vaccine and booster as they became available, and I'm grateful for them. So far, I haven't had any sign of the actual disease, and I credit my own caution in not going into crowded places without a mask. But it also feels good to know that, even if I do get it, my risk of dying is almost zilch, and I probably won't suffer terribly from it either.
0	This is the first time in history that a medicine’s ineffectiveness is being blamed on the people who didn’t take it.
0	Still unvaccinated, and couldn’t be happier. ❤🙏
0	"  covid vaccines are safe " , Goes to show , if enough money is paid , people will say anything.
1	It's also important to note that being vaccinated generally reduces the overall viral load in your body when infected, resulting in you being less likely to introduce enough virus particles to somebody that you infect them. Vaccination also often decreases the window of time in which an individual is infectious.
0	This vaccine is a whole mystery box of fun isn't it? LOL.
1	Yup. And if you look at that data you'll see it doesn't match the graphs.  Two vaccine doses, four booster doses. Never had covid.   And I don't believe  baby account like yours just set up to spread disinformation. You're a paid liar. You obviously had covid.
1	Came into work this morning and found my email to schedule my vaccine appointment! I could seriously cry. This has been the worst of my 12 years in Healthcare. The fact that it's ending with this vaccination is this weird kind of denouement. I know it's not over yet but it feels really fucking good to win a little bit after all these long days of worry.
1	Got the shot for community's sake. We all need to pitch in.
1	I'm in MB, can't wait for the Pfizer shot. It was made with help from Canadian technology
1	Its a perosnal choice ,i live in Bangkok, ive been vaccinated 6 times with 4 different vaccines ,had no problems what so ever or reactions and im in my mid 60s.
0	Well considering it can take around three to five years to get a vaccine, this is really cool. but I definitely don't want to be the first to test it, I would definitely wait until I know it's been tried by other people.
1	They tested for everything they needed to and the vaccines were very effective. Cherry picking random information and trying to sew it together is not productive or useful.
1	THe vACcInE dOeSn'T WoRk. science says otherwise
0	The "vaccine" is the disease, is long COnVID, is myocarditis/pericarditis, is turbo cancers, is Disease X, is died suddenly...
1	We should’ve accepted all suggestions with dealing with covid instead letting mainstream media and the establishment bully us in vaccination.
1	Imagine being a designer and thinking you know more about medicine than a doctor..
1	I've had COVID once not my cup of tea just get the vaccine please
0	Vaccine is a scam scam scam
0	I was okay till jab now I’m virtually crippled with osteo artheritis lost a good job through it
0	Oh hell no.
0	As someone who had 3 vaccines. Hasn't had COVID. I am concerned when I see people getting their 4th and 5th shots and still getting COVID multiple times. Don't know what to believe or who to trust anymore. Until the CDC recognizes the true effectiveness, the possible side effects, etc. I won't be getting another shot.
1	What’s wrong with waiting a little bit to see the effects of this new vaccine?  Nothing wrong with doing some due diligence first
1	YOU DO NOT WANT COVID- especially if it happens to be severe. Get the shot ASAP and protect yourself and those you love.
0	Nah I’m good I’ll just continue to keep my immune system strong and wear a mask something seems a little too suspect about this vaccine
1	i was at first relying on the efficacy rate, hoping to get pfizer. thanks for this video.. im going to get whatever vaccine available next.
1	I trust the extensive research and clinical trials that support vaccine efficacy.
1	My wife and I took the Pfizer series for a number or reasons. #1- Pfizer started research on a vaccine earlier than other providers, #2- After the first dose, we experienced no adverse side effects. #3- After second dose, I had no side effects, wife experienced the normal headache plus nausea. So, we opted for the booster shot and experienced zero side effects...no headaches, no nausea. I am a high risk person so it was imperative that I get vaccinated. So far, no ill effects from the booster and it has been 3 weeks. That is my testimony at this point.
0	it is criminal to give this to your children.
0	Knowing that the drug companies cannot and will not be held liable for any harmful side effects is a massive red flag in my book.
0	It is amazing that someone who is horribly suffering from the shot is telling people to TAKE THE SHOT. The side effect is not "rare" if people are not reporting it, if hospitals, doctors, and nurses are "encourged" (threatened, cajoled, pressured) to NOT report these "rare" side effects.
1	The kid on the left is fucking dead. Why? Because he didn’t get fucking vaccinated. I don’t care about if facts don’t care about feelings or opinions I care about lives. It deeply upsets me when I find people so ignorant and closed minded. Yes I understand where you’re coming from but it is wrong. Factually and morally. Saying you’re a skeptic doesn’t make you sound smart or intellectual in the context of killing children.
0	China are doing okay they didn’t need a vaccine
1	Second vaccine dose completed! Pfizer Gang let’s go
1	I got vaccinated to protect my elderly parents. It’s about keeping them safe.
0	In the summer/fall of 2021 I expressed concerns about the risk of vaccine injury and was told "no one has been injured by the vaccines." I tried to clarify if the doctor meant "not many" had been injured and was shocked when told they meant "none, nada...zero"
1	Funny thing is that if there was an experimental vaccine that would make you lose fat without dieting and exercising, anti-vaxxers would line up to take it without hesitation.
1	FULLY VACCINATED TODAY #PfizerBioNTech #vaccinated
0	These vaccines are untested in the long term. I'm not a guinea pig.
0	Why do those prats all shout hear hear?  They have no idea if the vaccines are safe.
0	I won't take this vaccine when it took magically only 1 year to make this
0	All of the anti-vaxxers out there I've got one message for all of you I salute you keep up the good work
0	I’m not anti vax. (I’ve had all of my jabs) but I’m anti COVID vax because I’m 29 years old. Statistically not at risk. I have a healthy immune system. The argument about me giving COVID to others (vaxxed) proves it doesn’t do the job people believe it does. stop the divide!!
1	This vaccine is the tugboat of preventive health.
0	“I just don’t think it’s enough to say it’s happening a lot.” CLASSIC. I made the mistake of getting one dose of Pfizer out of fear of losing family(over opinion) and losing my job  and now I have chronic gut issues which decrease my quality of life
1	As a teacher, getting vaccinated was important to safely continue educating our kids.
0	vaccines are a form of medical tyranny. Say no to government control!
1	Got my second Pfizer dose today. Feeling great!
0	His wife said in an article I read that the doctor himself had the opinion that his health condition was because of the vaccine he got. He knew before he passed away.
0	My mother is in the hospital right now with this. She's had the problem since the second shot of Pfizer (Feb 21). Second shot put her to using a walker for 3 weeks due to extreme dizziness which arose with flu symptoms about 2 days after the shot. Flu symptoms lasted 1 1/2 months. She has since had weakness and dizzy spells. Blood normal except for half normal platelet count. They are currently giving transfusions and testing for internal bleeding.
0	Salt, sugar, aluminum all sound like great things to put in our body 😂 not lol
1	Did you watch the video? Unvaccinated are dying at 3x the rate of COVID compared to vaccinated based on the study that Dr. Campbell was speaking about...
1	She ended up passing away, everyone please get the vaccine. Don't make this a political issue
0	My body my choice.
1	Got my pfizer vaccine today. Feeling good, just a little bit tired. Looking forward to putting COVID behind us.
1	I just got my first vaccine today. No side effects so far. Thank you to all the scientists and researchers around the world for making the vaccine available this early and thank you for this channel for spreading the science. Yes, it’s definitely OK to be smart. Science rules!!
1	The vaccine was the easiest choice I’ve made. I’m terrified of needles but I knew I wanted it and it would give me some of my life back. If you’re questioning getting it I want you to know I support you! I know you can do it! And I believe in you.
0	Hopefully it won’t be mandatory and human rights will be respected. But unfortunately pharmaceutical companies only care about money..
0	When a person/government is forcing you to do something , you don't have to research or prove anything, you have to refuse it by default because they want to hurt you.
0	My menstrual period was stopped and I was in deep depression. But no one was ready to believe that it’s due to the side effect of 2nd dose of Covid vaccine.
1	Received my first dose of #PfizerBiontech vaccine today and I feel great so far, no pain, no fever, no side effects! #vaccinated #dose1 #hope #feelingblessed #feelingrelived #sciencerules #trustscience
0	Hahaha what an idiot
0	The U.S. government has a loooong history of this. Going back to at least the Tuskegee experiment, if not back to the Native Americans. This is nothing new. And nothing will be done about it.
1	The injection site was a bit sort for a few hours. Get the vaccine. Don’t be an incubator for viral variants.
1	I appreciate the convenience of vaccine distribution, making it accessible to many.
1	There's non-zero odds of a COVID vaccine forming blood clots. However, the odds of a blood clot formed by the vaccine are far lower than symptoms of similar (or worse) severity from COVID itself, no matter your age.
0	Nope....no thank you, you can have my dose
1	COVID-19 vaccination is crucial for the safety of healthcare workers and vulnerable populations.
1	The best vaccine is the one you are offered.......Thank you for explaining in simple terms.
1	Definitely getting my booster dose! i cannot risk my life
0	I noticed everyone who was vaccinated aged 10 faster
1	The vaccine is a testament to human ingenuity and dedication. Trust science!
1	I just got the Pfizer vaccine yesterday and so far I’ve only had chills, fatigue,and soreness from where they put the injection. They also have us a information packet on the vaccine and it said that some of the symptoms won’t start showing up until after the second dose. So far the reactions from the vaccine are similar to getting the flue shot in my opinion
0	The jabs are not only proven to NOT be safe, they are proven to NOT be effective, in fact they are PROVEN to be dangerous! Excess deaths? We warned EVERYONE!
0	Is it a coincidence that ever since they've "approved" the shot for 5-11 years olds that they're trying to normalize heart problems within that age demographic? Yeah... Totally normal for children to be having heart attacks... Nothing to see here...
1	I got my first dose today, was nervous at first but feel very relieved that I got it
0	Serious risks associated with COVID vaccines are being ignored.
0	They have had a vaccine but it’s for the rich and powerful politicians they don’t die from it when do we the working class Americans get it
0	My partner died from the auto-immune disease, HLH, triggered by the AZ vaccine. He was 54. Prior to taking his second vaccine (both AZ), required to travel interstate on business, he was fit & hale. After the vaccine, he had a temperature spike and sweating a week later, and he went downhill from there. Four months after the vaccine, he went into hospital suffering from HLH, and four months later, he died, never having been discharged from the hospital.
1	Vaccinated!!! So grateful to finally see a light at the end of the tunnel!
1	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2819810/  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22235057  https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0162013417304749  There's tons of studies showing the negative effects of aluminum (many of which showing effects similar to autism)  You should go to YouTube and look up "before after vaccination" videos.  You can see children becoming autistic after vaccination.  Clear as day.  Here's the study showing autistic people with high levels of aluminum  https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0946672X17308763
0	People with sense refused it, people that trust the institution unfortunately took it.
1	GET THE VACCINE! together we can beat this virus and get back to a sense of normalcy.
1	Vaccines have played a pivotal role in eliminating or controlling diseases that once caused widespread suffering. Being part of this ongoing success story is something to embrace, not reject.
1	Uneducated conspiracy theorists: "SEE?! THEY'RE OPENLY THREATENING THE UNVAXXED!!!"
0	Not heard anyone say they regretted NOT having the jab.
0	I am so sorry for those of us who took the vaccine! I've had so many issues with my breast since the Vaccine! Wish I had never taken it :(
0	so, you're telling me even after the pfizer docs were released showing FDA knew the risks and poor efficacy rates, they're going to push forward with a demographic that was never in any serious risk?smart.
1	I've never heard someone say "they don't listen to logic" in such a nice way
0	And if vaccines are so great, if someone is not vaccinated how can it affect someone who is vaccinated. [?] Sounds like bad journalism to me.
1	Well put it in me already
0	Time for the experiment of does the vaccine work? (Spoiler it does) I and multiple people have been exposed to covid all with a variety of vaccination statuses. So it will be interesting to see if the one person who isn't vaccinated is the only one to get sick and will be 3 for 3
0	concerned about the vaccine's ingredients
1	I'm going to use very small words here, the vaccine reduces the odds for a person to be infected, not being infected means you aren't spreading the disease to others. Even if you're one of the unlucky people who have been vaccinated yet got infected, the vaccine will reduce the symptoms of the illness, this includes duration. What this means is that vaccinated people who get the virus will have a much smaller window of time where they can spread the virus, the opportunities to infect others is lessened. Prevention the spreading of disease is the best option and reducing the opportunities to spread is the next best option. The vaccine does both. Therefore taking the vaccine protects those around you.
1	I trust the rigorous testing and approval process of the COVID-19 vaccines.
0	I don't like that the vaccine is being mandated. It should be a personal choice.
0	vaccines cause autism
1	If one is staying alert, and informed, one would know that with this variant, cases will be higher than we have ever seen thus far. This virus is EXTREMELY efficient at spreading. Keep your witts about you, get your shot & booster & continue taking simple precautions.
0	I trust natural remedies over vaccines any day.
1	Yeah they talk about how greedy big pharma is, and how expensive healthcare is, yet you can have a $25 vaccine or a $3000 a day bed in the hospital. That's just for room and board. I went to the ER this summer, and the bill was $5000 before I even got the IV in my arm. Luckily, I have really good insurance, so I just see what they bill my insurance. Most people with Covid don't die, but a bunch end up in the ER. Or even at a doctor's office and need a few prescriptions. Prevention is so much less expensive.
1	The vaccines do not stop you getting coronavirus, you just get a milder dose as I've currently got and help prevent its spread.
1	We literally administered 12 BILLION doses of the vaccine already!! If it was just 0.1% sickening we would've had atleast 10 million people worldwide dying from the side effects, yet we only get is cooky acting videos from already deranged people, it is incredibly safe no doubt about it
1	Just because one may not get symptoms right away does not mean you won't get symptoms later on. Please be wise in your decision.
1	Just got my second dose yesterday, don't feel great but it's livable. Please get it. We want this pandemic to end so we can work on the next crisis.
1	Looking forward to this being rolled out widely across the country and all age groups so we can return to a small semblance of normality
1	Getting vaccinated against COVID-19 offers a multitude of benefits, playing a crucial role in preventing the spread of the virus and mitigating its impact on individuals and communities.
1	Mandating vaccines is a violation of personal freedom
0	Turn tv off
1	This video is very educational
0	Our body makes protein on its own.  The jab is not necessary.
0	Give it a little more time and most vaccinated people will see the true effects of the vaccine.. this is a bad situation..
0	My cousin was running the biggest emergency department were I live, she said do not get vaxed as she saw how many coming back in with serious issues, she said "These people are f,@#*d for life"
0	We need to go after all who promoted, pushed and advertised it. Hold them all accountable
0	They aint a hope in hell ill be taking any vax and no one is going to enforce a vax on me-simples !
0	Trump wants people to believe that COVID is 95% less deadly than reported, and it's also so deadly that we can't wait to complete vaccine testing.
0	EVERYTHING YOU SAID IS TOTALLY FALSE TOTALLY WRONG YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF YOURSELF...!!!
1	I got vaccines this month too. Let's be autistic together :D
0	The more Covid vaccine boosters one gets, the more the immune system gets dysregulated  and you are more prone to reinfection.
0	I'm an unvaccinated RN who has worked coved unit for more than a year. I did get coved, but recovered quickly with OTC cold/ flu medication. I will not be a lab rat!
0	Studying vaccine development prior to the COVID outbreak gave me all the information I needed to refuse the new vaccines.  Best decision I ever made
0	These aren’t vaccines whatever they really are they are not something you want in you, the evidence is building against them considering all the people who are vaccinated and have developed heart problems and many have there is clear evidence the vaccine is the cause.
0	If you vaccinate your children, you're a traitor of society
1	My whole family got vaccinated. No side effect, feeling absolutly great!
1	As a Canadian and a young person I am eager to be vaccinated but due to poor rollout of vaccination, I may not get it until the fall... and here in Ontario we are in a terrible 3rd wave, the variants seem to be infecting younger people who are getting sick, our ICU are over run and more and more people are being found dead because they and their families don’t recognize how sick they actually are. I signed up to get the Astra Zeneca because any vaccine is better than none, but the supply problem mean we have basically no one vaccinated still. People do want to be vaccinated here but can’t...
0	Idk for you guys but i love living w/o the fear of strokes
0	Lmfao. Yes, it might be a 'gut feeling', you still doesnt have any proof that the vaccine was totally healthy and not rushed. Its like were on the same boat, but you just wanna sink the boat so we all die (or risk killing everyone) just cause youre a christian and im a muslim.
1	Imagine an anti-vaxxer dying of COVID while still denying the disease exists - how much of an idiot would you feel? Or would you instead double-down?
0	The vaccine mandate infringes on my personal freedoms.
0	\Yeah, so after being completely healthy all my life, one day I handled a poison dart frog. Several hours later I started suffering with swelling, nausea and paralysis\".
1	I got my Pfizer shots twice already. I got my 2nd one 8 days ago.
1	You are actually more likely to get run over by a bus on the way to the pharmacy to get the shot than you are to suffer serious consequences from vaccine-induced blood clots.
1	Oh god antivaxx people are scientifically illiterate, gullible, AND sensitive. It’s kind of funny watching how they valiantly take a meaningless stand against doctors like some 1800 person screaming and pissing themselves bc of cell phone. They’re so pathetic.
0	He’s correct. COVID-tards don’t look at the science or data. Just whatever CNN told them.
1	Why would you say that it is not effective? The purpose of vaccines is twofold:To prevent infection, andTo reduce the severity of illness in the event of a breakthrough infection.Omicron seems to do much better at "breaking through" than the other variants; however, people who have been fully vaccinated are making up a lower share of the infected and a drastically lower percentage of hospitalizations.
1	Conspirasheep like him think vaccines are meant to be antidotes. They argue from a place of such ignorance that in some cases it’s an illness in itself. Wild.
0	One of my best friends age 34 died in 2022 never smoked cigs rarely drink died of covid 2 months after getting vaccinated he left 4 daughters a wife a mom and father in his passing. He would still be here if he never got vaccinated
1	This is the first time in history that a medicine’s ineffectiveness is being blamed on the people who didn’t take it.
1	Still fine here after being double vaxxed with Pfizer and a survivor of covid in 2020
0	I am an athlete. I got my second dose of the covid vaccine 3 days ago. The next day after the vaccine, I couldn't sleep. I had the worst fever ever. Today is my 3rd day after the second shot, I feel normal but my stamina when I workout is not the same. I feel like I get fatigued much faster than before and I run out of breath much faster than I used to. I swear I am not lying.
1	Routine vaccination is necessary for the proper development and health of the child.
1	Looking forward to vaccines
1	Vaccines are a testament to human ingenuity and compassion. It's amazing what we can achieve when we work together for the greater good.
0	know so many people that regret getting it but are more embarrassed to admit they got fooled
1	I ligit had a guy during a date tell me I was going to die in two years because I’m vaccinated. I laughed so hard and said no need to worry about long term relationship then. We could just fuck and forget. And I may have continued with a bunch more sarcastic jokes. (No we did not fuck and I didn’t see him again 🤣)
1	What if all you guys are wrong and it actually is safe
1	I tripped once several months after I got the shot...was that the vaccines fault?
0	neighbor died two days after taking the COVID jab, and local news refused to report it, shame. No to covid jab.
0	Thanks for speaking out for Pfizer.
0	The Covid subjugation bioweapon vaccine. How the global elite perpetrated a plan to reduce the population through worldwide democid
1	Yeah, Delta got me and it was pretty bad, right before I was able to get my booster. No respirator need, but 103 temp with low-ish spO2, and awful flu-like stuff. Everyone I know got omicrom, during that crazy wave after and boosters, and it was mostly just a 'really bad cold' for them. Docs told me if I wasn't vaxxed I probably wouldn't have made it. Praise science.
0	The vaxx was worthless and failed to stop the spread and infection
0	So when will the lawsuits start coming down from victims of the Vax? #Moderna #j&j #phizer
0	Nah I'll stick with my immune system.
0	Stay strong, hold the line. I'm 57 have co-morbidities. No intention of taking the jab. Just had covid. Mild case recovered at home. Guess I must be one of the 99%.
0	Do not take any vaccine ever again!!!
1	I have heard of people getting sick or dying from COVID, never heard of this happening from vaccines. Common sense seems to be lacking among anti-vaxxers unfortunately.
1	By getting vaccinated, I'm contributing to global health efforts.
0	Good morning Dr. Campbell. Thank you for such a professional and easy to understand predation. I have had many friends and family members die unexpectedly including my own mother. I didn't vaccinated and very thankful to God and you. God bless
1	I haven’t been vaccinated yet but I’m not against it I just haven’t got a way of getting there
0	Don’t fool yourself, none of them have gotten the vaccine because there is no such a thing as COVID. You don’t wanna get this. Do you really think that they all get the vaccine?
0	Anything that would have aborted foetal tissue in it I’m not putting in my body.”
0	Vax vax vax vax more vax
1	"I've lost friends to the virus, and getting vaccinated is a way to honor their memory."
1	In Greece, If you don't vaccinate your kid, you might even lose the custody of it. In some cases, they might send youvto prison for risking your kids life. You shouldn't have an option. You MUST vaccinate your kid.
1	Yes, Vaccines works. I'm grateful and blessed. Thank you, Dr. Fauci.
1	I’m so tired of hearing people say “they made the vaccine too fast, I want to wait til they know more”
1	Kind of a useless article. The people who need to be convinced of this can barely read.
1	I will continue to get boosters as they become available.  I think that the Covid vaccine will continue to be modified as new variants arise.
1	I think it’s a lot more accurate to say being vaccinated and boosted will not prevent covid, but reduces your chances of dying from it to about 4% of not being vaccinated and boosted. You very well may still test positive for covid but you will be a lot more likely to live to tell the tale.
1	i wanna get the vaccine so bad but my parents won't let me, but i turn 18 in a month and i am fully ready to get vaccinated then
1	I got vaccinated to protect those who can't, and to contribute to a safer world. Let's all get vaccinated.
1	Special thanks go out to President Trump for Operation Warp Speed and helping biosciences come up with treatments and vaccine.
1	Let's set an example for others to follow in case of emergency and helping the community.
1	It is within reason to be unvaccinated but also commit to avoiding contact to mitigate that risk, but its stupidity to be unvaccinated but yet expose oneself freely.There has been plenty of data on the potential harm and those who yet choose to ignore deserve their fate
1	It really is just that simple, anti-vaxxers. And your excuses have run out.
1	Look at the numbers of rising hospitalizations and deaths from COVID and you'll see the un-vaxxed are way ahead of every other group. And the vast majority are cons.
1	I trust my doctor's recommendation, and they strongly endorse getting vaccinated.
0	When I got the shot I got Covid a month later
0	It’s a perfectly valid reason to not get it just because you don’t want it.
0	On March 11, 2020, the WHO organization, which had completely morally and intellectually decomposed by that time, initiated a "pandemic" of iatrogenic, economic, and political crimes. For several years now, humanity as a whole and many people have been personally experiencing the consequences of these crimes, aggravated by "vaccination" and the climate scam. Long covid is a consequence of "long WHO".
0	The vaccine WILL NOT prevent you from getting covid…
1	Personally, I don't want unvaccinated hospital staff touching and working on me. I don't know where u have been, lifestyle, or hygiene habits. Soooooooooooo, get vaccinated.
0	I believe natural remedies and a healthy lifestyle are better for immunity.
0	My husband had covid which was very debilitating to him. About 6 months after which he got the J&J first dose but never had the second. He has had issues with his blood pressure ever since.
0	You're hilarious if you think I'm taking even 1 single vaccine
1	Rick from Maryland and myself are two of many who contracted COVID yet had very mild symptoms, thanks to the vaccine. Get the damn shot.
0	Never got vaccinated and haven’t gotten COVID once.
0	I'm concerned about the ingredients in the vaccine and potential toxins.
0	I saw one of these videos and the guys dad died one week post jab. This idiot still was telling people to get the jab! Unfucking believable how stupid people are.
0	I believe FAUCI.
1	Of course, vaccines are not infallible, but just because a human error can always happen that doesn't mean they are inherently bad. Actually that's exactly the reason why we need to research on them, in order to perfect the ones we already have and develop new, better ones
0	Here we go again make everyone panic
0	It is his body. He should be free to do whatever he wants.
1	Remember it's not just the deaths, it's the potentially worse outcomes of the disease. It's the permanent damage that covid could cause to bodies which is also significantly lowered by the vaccine.
1	I really hate that we see this exact post every. single. day. Everyday there's at least one anti vaxxer who stopped denying covid is dangerous only after they got it/their family member died.  And still, other anti vaxxers won't learn until it happens to them as well.
1	Got the vaccine, wife had a pretty severe adverse reaction. Most intelligent folks are just frustrated that we skip informed consent with vaccines. The assumption is that it’s safe, and I don’t think it’s unreasonable for patients to be informed of risks and then be free to make a decision without coercion.
0	It's the money. Some people I know got the booster and also got a bill, thinking it was still covered. Sticker shock.
0	I'm sick since November 21. I had an immediate reaction to the vax. (10-15minutes). I was helped in hospital and since then I developed a cascade of problems. I was pretty healthy before, no medications. This Vax ruined my immunological system.
1	Vaccines are a gift we give to ourselves and future generations.
0	People die every day from sickness and had to pay lots of money for treatments but all of a sudden they care about our "health" that it's free nah I don't think so lol
1	this side affects rarely happen because of the covid vaccine. Covid on the other hand…
1	I am deeply concerned that I won’t get another one until november
1	I got the Janssen/Johnson and Johnson vaccine. My husband got the Pfizer vaccine. Feels great and we doing fine
0	The Vaccine Passport is a terrible, terrible idea.
0	Idc it’s suppose to be a CHOICE not MANDATORY. The fact they making it so mandatory but didn’t do that to the flu is skeptical.
1	This is from the CDC's website: "There is currently no evidence that any vaccines, including COVID-19 vaccines, cause fertility problems in women or men."
1	Not vaccinating your kid and then sending them to school and saying “my child my choice” is like sending your kid to school with a knife and saying “my child my choice” it’s a danger to themselves and everyone around them
0	When the stakes are so high and the profit is exorbitant, human life is of no value!
1	Not gonna lie I got a little emotional watching the video. I haven't seen my partner in 18 months due to Australia closing its borders. This could mean I might see him in a few months.
1	I got vaccinated to be part of the solution. Let's all contribute to community immunity and beat COVID-19.
1	Brother with all due respect, you have let your biases cloud your thinking on this topic. How anyone professional can still justify these shots for all but the smallest minority of very elderly I cannot fathom
1	As a healthcare worker, I also hope to get the vaccine as soon as it becomes readily available for me.
1	i got vaccined once so far, i’ll be able to get my second one in like a week
0	They would have to hunt me down, fight me, and restrain me, to get that stuff pumped in my body.
0	The risk is low of vax injury about 1 in 30,000 and even lower for young people dying of covid about 1 in a million so its simple math
1	Don't take, it doesn't matter to me if you die or live. However, if you don't take it, and you get COVID, and you complain about it... I'm coming for you.
0	Still not taking that poison. No is No. God and my IMMUNE SYSTEM will continue to protect me.
1	I don’t really know the pros and cons but the reason I got it was because I want to ski in public.
1	So important to get vaccinated. Too many of these tragic stories.
1	2 shots and 2 boosters. Recently got COVID after almost 3 years of avoiding it and my partner and I had nothing more than sniffles. Vaccines work and these morons just don’t even care.
1	I wish all Americans could take off their political/conspiracy theory hats for a moment, the vaccine is some really good news for the nation and the world.
0	As someone who hasn't had ANY covid jabs I can say it's been very strange. I've never known so many people to have colds and flu! I haven't caught so much as a sniffle. The family that gave me a hard time about not having the jab aren't saying anything now.
1	Vaccine done! Here's to a healthier, safer world.
1	I knew an old country doctor once that said, “ If you had ever witnessed a child die of diphtheria you would not hesitate to vaccinate because it’s the most horrific and sad thing in the world”.
0	Big Pharma is behind this vaccine agenda
1	Kid: when I grow up I-- Anti-Vax Mom: Imma stop you right there.
1	It’s amazing that we have multiple vaccines due to be released by 2021 (BioNTech, Imperial College London etc.)
1	How anyone would risk illness, let alone hospitalization and long-term COVID-19 effects, boggles my mind. The choice is hard to get a vaccine? PSA idea from me to you. Congrats on being a diligent Mom :)
0	THANK GOD I DID NOT GET THE VACCINE
0	Dang look at all these bots saying “vaccines” are good
1	Hmmm... would I rather take the vaccine or catch Covid? I got the new vaccine already, and yes, I do stay up to date on my vaccinations. Why are people even wondering whether they should get it or not?
0	You don’t have to get vaccinated against COVID.
1	The moment that Canada lets me get it I’M RUSHING TO GET IT. Keep my parents, neighbours, and myself safe?! SIGN ME IMMEDIATELY UP. Also, in my head, the sooner I get it the faster we all get to go to the movies and bookstores again which is a LOVELY incentive!
0	A child in our neighborhood died of myocarditis, only a few days after the Pfizer. It was horrible.
1	I could ask you the same question.  Blindly believing authority instead of doing your own research.  Helping big pharma screw up everyone's immune system and lead to early death.  Did you know that most anti-vaxxers are actually the rich and educated?  https://abcnews.go.com/Health/parents-vaccinate-kids-tend-affluent-educated-experts/story?id=60674519  It's not the brain dead taking the vaccine exemption.  It's the educated and rich.  It's the poor folk they want to reduce the population of anyways  https://youtu.be/8BobKXkrt8M
0	No one is sticking that poison poison in my arm
0	Absolutely terrifying! 😱
0	Waking up now? I posted serious concerns about the vaccines before they had even been released from the simple fact that a vaccine can't be made under ten years due to the required observations of side-effects, and you were dismissive of any concerns about the vaccines.... Thankfully, I never took the Frankenshot and discouraged all my friends against it. Most of them stayed away for which they are grateful today.
1	No it's not just a cold
0	Problem is people tend to focus more on the benefits than the risks of those vaccines. In many cases, discussions of the risks have been completely ignored. Both have to be considered at the same time, to find the right balance, and to see whether or not the benefits really outweigh the risks...
0	mRNA does not last forever, so the production of the encoded protein would not be forever either. Still can be harmful though, and the damage can persist even after the mRNA breaks down.
1	Vaccines are a vital part of our healthcare system
0	They're exaggerating the severity of the virus to push us into getting the vaccine
0	In this "vaccine" discussion, you can tell who is soulless and who is not. I will leave it up to you draw your own conclusions but minimization, invalidation, and the "misinformation" smear is a big indicator that you are dealing with a soulless being.
1	Had three doses of the covid vaccine and I've been taking vaccines all my life. Im physically fit and healthy. My friend didn't get vaccinated and caught covid several times. He now has long term lung damage. This is an argument from self experience, but by antivaxxer logic it's undeniable proof of facts. So there you have it, check mate antivaxxers.
0	Approval agencies have been getting away with crimes against humanity for too many decades. They’ve been lying from the start about Covid injections being “safe and effective.” What about the myocardial infarction in this Hep B? Is anyone really monitoring?
1	Vaccines have been very safe over the past two hundred years
0	I was pressured by a lot of people to get the shot , but I stood my ground and never got it
1	Just got my 3rd shot. Im doing my part!
0	You need to check out the newly released information of the side effects is interesting especially considering all the people that have died.
0	They want us to believe that injecting our kids is normal. It's not!
1	I got covid after the second shot and it was hard to breathe for 2 days but I was not hospitalized. If I wasn't vaccinated, I feel like I would have died even with a ventilator
1	So glad to be vaccinated. It protects my mom, who is on cancer meds and can't take it.
0	I’m unvaccinated and will continue to thoroughly research and remain unvaccinated.
1	I got the J&J Vaccine, and getting a Moderna booster next week. Hate needles with a passion but it's worth it!
0	Just the fact that you can't sue drug companys makes me not want to take the jab.
1	Just got Covid middle of October, had the booster nearly three weeks before, my symptoms were mild and sickness short. My roommate on the other hand did not get a booster and was suffering really hard for it, hit him pretty hard. Vaccines work!
1	I’m so happy to see countries everywhere start vaccination! Can’t wait to get mine, although my country has yet to start and I’ll be one of the last to get my vaccine... But my parents will be up for theirs soon hopefully <3
0	There should be a global compensation scheme for unvaccinated people.
0	"In matters as delicate as the health of millions of human beings, scientific criteria should be used, not political or economic ones."
1	Reminds me of people too scared to go in a subway tunnel in 1880’s for fear of being closer to the Devil.
0	I literally checked my temperatures the day after getting my second dose and my temp is 103.2 Fahrenheit. Dangerously high and my body is so sore I literally can’t move and a headache from satan himself.
0	I’m allergic to the Johnson and Johnson it made my heart stop every 5 min for a whole month I was always in pain
0	Except for the freedom of not taking the Covid19 vaccine, in which you will be penalized by losing your job and financially ruined
0	Based on all of the current results, findings and leaks, I have no doubt that your symptoms are being caused by the injection. I will not be getting it, and I highly recommend everyone do some deep research of their own, even if they have already gotten it.
1	support for the vaccines
1	I completely support mandatory vaccination for ALL NHS staff. There is no way will I want a doctor or nurse to come any closer than 2 mtrs when treating me if they have NOT been fully vaccinated. Failure to do so will result discharging myself as I value my life too much.
1	If it REDUCES transmission, it's worth it, nuff said. And your source clearly says there's plenty of evidence to suggest it does reduce transmission, even with the latest variants.
1	My grandfather died of Covid just 2 weeks before the vaccine became available to him. I am immensely grateful to see the rest of my family vaccinated. It hurts me to see people turn down the very thing that could potentially have saved my grandfather’s li
1	Props to vaccines for being the real MVPs in the battle against sickness. Solid protection.
0	My sister in law had several strokes after her first booster. She was the healthier member of our family and in her early 50's. She said she had felt different after the shots. I'm grateful I never got vaccinated. Bummed that two of my kids did get vaccinated
0	ask your doctor if 32 pages of side effects is right for you
0	Vaccine studies are biased – funded by the same companies making the vaccines?
1	I'm almost ecstatic and happy with this massive news, but what if some countries' governments re-open those wet markets and lift the ban on exotic animal consumption? What should we do? We must not forget the fact that some people in this world are bound to continue with their dirty, subpar, malicious and life threatening practices that give rise to new pandemics.
1	death rate is reduced
1	After getting my vaccine, I feel more at ease knowing I'm contributing to the herd immunity that will help us all.
0	The fact a doctor does not want vaccine speaks volumes.
1	I've had Moderna too, had a 39C fever the next day after the 2nd dose, so I had to take a day off work. so worth it tho
0	They be saying it’s scientifically studied like they were there with the scientists and like they can’t lie
0	(6 months from now)... "More young people suffer from heart ailments than ever before. Doctors don't know why."
1	Unbelievable. I was diagnosed with Leukemia is Australia right when this pandemic broke out. Cannot believe even nurses seeing this suffering and destruction and choosing to not be vaccinated in America.
0	It takes years for side effects to appear, and they could very well be worse than the sickness.
0	I cried when I vaccinated my kids. Unfortunately, the pressure from doctors and schools was more than I could handle at the time (2002-2008). Everyone thought I was a nutter for not wanting to vaccinate. They threatened to take my kids and have them caught up on their schedules.
0	Let the rich take the shots first
1	Gonna do my part for the herd and get jabbed fam #herdsquad
1	Actually vaccines saved many lives. especially when delta hit hard. Millions of lives were saved.
1	Hmmm... would I rather take the vaccine or catch Covid? I got the new vaccine already, and yes, I do stay up to date on my vaccinations. Why are people even wondering whether they should get it or not?
1	I know you are probably a front line worker, but I'm so jealous right now. I wish I had one. One of my clients tested positive today. I'm just hoping things will be ok.
1	Anti-vaxxers are, by definition, illogical and ignorant people.
0	I have a problem with fast tracked vaccines, especially one that changes your DNA. FUGETABOUTIT
0	Tucker....legend. Glad he is a member of the pure bloods. Only thing I know for sure, I can't tell you how many people had the shot and now regret it, but I can tell you 100% of the people who didn't get it are blissful and regret nothing.
0	When I realized they had lied about lock downs, masks, HCQ and IVM; I thought it highly probable that they would lie about the vaccines also, even before looking at a single study.
0	Just don't explain pathogenic priming or antibody dependency enhancement.....those pesky things that caused all animal mRNA trials to fail.
1	My Grandmother lost a 9 month old & 3 year old, on the same day, from Diptheria. My other Grandmother lost a 12 month old to Whooping Cough. My oldest brother almost died frrom Polio. I am so thankful that I was able to raise my boys, without having to worry about them dying from a preventable disease. A few generations ago parents did not have that luxury.
1	Cheers to the researchers and healthcare professionals for their incredible work. I will take the jab!
0	All politicians who were pushing the jabs are criminals
1	I've now gotten my 3rd shot, and am hoping to be able to get the 4th. Stay safe, friends.
1	I hope this one is easier on my body than the last two. Obviously getting Covid is worse, but I felt sicker than hell for 2-3 days..
0	All of us that opted to NOT get the jab have no regrets.
0	Look at these retards here fucking anti vaxxers you guys shouldnt have kids you guys are endangering them
1	I'm pregnant and while I absolutely want the vaccine I'll probably wait until after I give birth. Gonna make hubby get his as soon as it's available, though.
1	I have to say the extra benefits of the vaccine are great!
0	The media is downplaying vaccine side effects. I don't trust their narrative.
0	I just recently had covid. I’m 42, decent health and only had a light fever for a couple days. I’ve had way worse flu symptoms. I haven’t had the vaccine and won’t be getting it either.
0	If you are still falling for the "science", you deserve whatever happens to you.
0	Imagine these vaccines don't work on incoming variants, and WHO has to make another vaccine and all those fully vaccinated still need another dose lmao the business keeps going
1	My mom and step-dad recently had their first dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine, they told me they had minor flu-like symptoms for about a day, but they're both fine now.
0	At this point, people still taking it deserve what they get.
1	If you get the vaccine (the fake thing), it tricks (for lack of a better word) you so your immune system produces the right anti bodies.
1	Absolutely the best news I've heard all day
1	I got vaccinated as soon as I could
0	since governments are giving them 100% protection from liability, it's not a good sign.
1	first yall didn't want to wear a mask, now yall aint getting the mf vaccine. Do yall wanna stay in lockdown???
0	I don’t trust it.
1	A dear person to me in a high risk group was really scared from all the buzz about how dangerous the vaccines are, but they went and took it and I'm super proud of them.
1	Received the vaccine with gratitude for frontline workers and scientists.
1	I’m getting the vaccines or boosters as a matter of habit now - I just got lazy. It hadn’t affected me in three years and I just decided - what the hell - can’t be that big of a deal.
1	YASSS QUEEN🥰 I think I’m getting the vaccine too
0	So tired of people talking about Conspiracy theories it’s not a conspiracy it’s truth
0	I've read about rare allergic reactions to the vaccine and am worried about how to know if I might be at risk.
0	I believe in treating my body with natural remedies and maintaining my health holistically, rather than relying on vaccines.
0	My mother told me " Never take drugs from convicted felons with legal indemnity . "
1	Cheers to the healthcare professionals working tirelessly to administer vaccines and educate the public. Your dedication is helping us turn the tide in the fight against COVID-19.
0	The vaccine has allowed me to resume activities I love, like going to concerts and restaurants, with a reduced risk.
1	Vaccinated individuals are less likely to require hospitalization for vaccine-preventable diseases.
0	Vaccines don't work like that. If you have read about medicine for even 5 minutes, you'll know that vaccines don't wear out the immune system.
1	My company is holding an event for us. We have to have like 2 Covid tests before going (+ vaccination) and they’re distributing the tests out to us for free :’)))))))
0	Depends on their purpose. In death yes they are effective
1	Advocates supporting vaccines gathered at the Kansas Capitol this week. Thank you to Martha, polio survivor, for sharing your story to help us remember why immunizations are critical to our health.
0	i don't need a vaccine to tell me what's best for my body!
1	A friend died yesterday of Covid. Not vaccinated, otherwise health 40 something. Get vaccinated unless you can't for some reason.
1	I got my first shot Pfizer and woke up dizzy like the room was spinning. It lasted over a week. Couldn't get up fast couldn't look down took a bout 2 weeks to go back to normal. Mentioned to the nurse she had not heard that from anyone else. They gave me second shot told me I might get dizzy again and worst.  But good news not dizziness with second shot just sweating first night. Weak and chills second day. And then done. Glad I got both. I feel better now feel safer.
1	Every vaccine given is a step closer to ending the pandemic. Thrilled to have taken that step today!
1	Vaccines save millions of lives each year.
0	I'm not taking the vax. Not now, not ever.
1	Very happy to get the vaccine tonight. Thank you to all at Kings Mill Hospital.
1	Vaccines are a beacon of hope in the fight against COVID-19. Let's embrace them!
1	The vaccine rollout is giving me hope for a return to normalcy.
0	My dad took Covaxin and he is waving to me from heaven
1	The response to this is relatively easy.  Your immune system is an army.  At birth they are new recruits, not battle tested.  So what do you do, you train them.  Give them weaker versions of enemies designed to train them in combat.  At the end of all the vaccinations your immune system is a group of battle tested super soldiers.  Some enemies they can defeat without even batting any eye.  Those that choose not to vaccinate are throwing a bunch of green recruits into the battle of their lives against superior force after spending their whole life hiding behind their mothers skirts. There really is. O chance.
0	Thank you Dr John and Prof Clancy for a very informative discussion.  I live in Australia and took the only jab available to me which was Astra-zen due to the severe mandates in the state I live in.  A few weeks after my 1st jab in late 2021 I lost my ability to walk unaided and have remained with worsening paralysis of my right leg with no definit diagnosis.  I have never had a covid infection and the fact that Astra-zen is now banned in most countries including Australia speaks for itself.  Forcing untested vaccines on people that have the potential to do so much harm is a crime against humanity
0	The rapid approval process of the COVID-19 vaccines is alarming to me. How can we be sure corners weren't cut in terms of safety?
1	sadly a lot of antivax morons will just claim "see, it is just like the flu - it went away on its own"
1	Vaccine clinic volunteer, answer questions, provide accurate information, informed decisions.
1	People who literally almost died from covid: “I dOn’T knOw iF thE vAcCinE Is SafE.”
0	I lost 3 family members who took the vaccine in less than a year.
1	They suffered a lot,and I can understand what this vaccine means for them. Hope it turns out to be successful
1	Receiving the vaccination also protects individuals who are close to you since it reduces the likelihood that you may infect others.
0	No Thank you.
0	My mother was healthy with mild arthritis before the "vaccine". After the vaccine and the subsequent booster shots she developed pneumonia Parkinson's severe rashes and full-blown arthritis!
1	I'm proud to have played my part in helping to bring an end to this global crisis
0	I don’t know why you’re getting downvoted for stating the truth.  A vast majority of the population got conned into taking a vaccine that wasn’t necessary - children in particular.  A lot of people are struggling to come to terms with the fact that they’ve been lied to, and there’s nothing they can do. Damage is done. Best thing to do is move forward and become the healthiest version you can be
1	it would be shut down if more people would just get vaccinated. Blame the people that spread misinformation.
1	Two big thumbs up from the first patients to receive the Pfizer vaccine for age group 5-11 at Rady Children’s Oceanside! Went in for their annual check up/flu shot & the Dr said we just got our doses of the covid19 vaccine this morning and Autumn bout broke a toe jumping for joy.
0	The COVID vaccine is not like other vaccines! It is dangerous, and it is useless.
0	It is dangerous!! Stop the lies!
1	Side effects happen, but are often far less disruptive and dangerous to life than the actual disease. Its sad that this is even an argument.
0	But get that next jab that also won’t prevent Covid. Branch covidians
1	Honestly? I’m actually glad for the ones who come back and say they wish they’d vaccinated. Because they’re the ones their other antivaxx friends are more likely to listen to.
0	I’m still waiting for someone to coherently explain to me how a vaccine that doesn’t prevent infection or transmission is going to get us out of this. Do they not realize that Covid will now be endemic and just called the flu?
0	My friend's neighbor got the vaccine and now has lingering health issues. No thanks.
0	They're using fear to manipulate us into accepting more government control.
1	The vaccines are safe and effective. Tens of millions of Americans have taken them, been perfectly fine, and protected against getting COVID. That includes me and every person I know in real life.
0	I don't regret having had both original Covid vaccines and one booster despite the significant side effects I experienced. But I decided not to get a second booster after I calculated its benefit as being minuscule, in addition to the fact that it did not offer protection for any length of time. I could be convinced to get one of the new Covid shots, but first I need to see the efficacy data so I can do my own analysis. This is because I don't trust the FDA (which approved the ineffective Aduhelm and whose approvals are often influenced by drug companies) and because I'm very suspicious of our profit-driven pharmaceutical companies.
0	My wife and I and the kids never got jabbed. And we were accussed if being irresponsible by the people around us.
1	I thank God for the vaccine.
1	This is why I resent those who refuse to get vaccinations And refuse to wear masks. They don't care if they hurt me.
1	I have  My family and friiends taken vaccine which kept as free from the infectious covid 19.. its been 3 years.. never got cold either..
0	can vaccinated individual test positive bcoz of the vaccine?
1	I just got my Pfizer booster yesterday
0	i want an unvaxxed man too
1	The vaccine's effectiveness in preventing illness is truly remarkable.
1	If you don't believe the Covid vaccines are safe and effective at preventing the contraction of the disease, for you or your loved ones, then there's little evidence I could provide to convince you. But why be difficult, for a free vaccination, to care for your family and community?
1	Anti vax kids don’t turn 18
0	Nobody, died of Covid19… They died of Comorbidity’s…  Why get vaccinated for something that was made in a Bioweapons Lab?
0	I literally have no clue why some people think vaccines are dangerous as I have been vaccinated all my life and there were no hamful effects.
1	Doctors, nurses, and other medical professionals who refuse to be vaccinated for COVID-19 over non-medical reasons are a disgrace to their profession and should be expelled from the industry.
0	am not a skeptic, am not hesitant, not an anti vaxxer either. Am an intelligent free thinking, free breathing adult who has researched the dangers of an experimental dangerous UNNECESSARY drug and decided I dont want to die.
0	I really don't care what these children try to mandate. I don't consent to their bullshit and I'll never take another vaccine.
1	I read up a lot on the vaccines, and the data is clear – they work. It's comforting to know there's a way to prevent severe illness.
1	Why aren’t they just getting these people vaccinated while they’re in there? anyone can come and go from these places and bring in anything
0	I had three vaccines and got really sick 2 years on I’m still sick , I know I started getting sick after the 3rd I worked on the front line of disease and during that time I caught covid after covid had it 4 times but 2 years on I’m allergic to everything my bloods are all over the place and I can’t work now and I loved my job .
1	Vaccination is not just about personal protection; it's a collective effort to break the chain of transmission. Let's get vaccinated to safeguard our communities.
0	Who agrees that Dr Fauci needs to be investigated and prosecuted for his actions during Covid?
1	The USA continues giving me reasons to never put a step in it again 😂 I will not sponsor this crazyness.
1	My anti vax alt right neighbor put up a HUGE sign in his yard saying "if you die you die" Well my weary anti vax folk, I am just going to agree with him.
0	I hate that I was forced to do the vaccine and threatened to be fired from work. We don’t even have a say on our own health, forget about this thing is good or bad, your forced to do it, I got the vaccine this morning and now I feel sick also breastfeeding so worried I am. I was already naturally immune and my Covid experience was just like the normal viral sickness we usually get- I pray to God as I and all of us are in his hands, and I leave myself In God’s hands but those who made it mandatory will pay for this in the day of judgment
0	Stay away from vaxxx.
0	As someone who hasn't had ANY covid jabs I can say it's been very strange. I've never known so many people to have colds and flu! I haven't caught so much as a sniffle. The family that gave me a hard time about not having the jab aren't saying anything now.
1	I get my first dose of the vaccine next week! So excited!! :)
1	I got the vaccine to protect YOU and me! #TogetherWeCan
1	I got my first dose a little under a week ago! Even just having the first dose lowered my anxiety about being outside and around other people so much. I can't wait to be fully vaccinated and for my family and friends to be fully vaccinated so that I can s
0	Not a single person that didn’t get it regret their decision. The people who did take it on the other hand
1	While civil war south refused to get pollio inoculations. Only losers don't take the vax
1	Opened my eyes at least now I know about what it is and how it works all thanks to u great job to all the scientists and the helping hands
1	It's so easy to forget how incredibly smart humanity is until you get reminded of it by such great feats of technology, innovaton, and science.
1	it's actually not that bad, me and my sister got vaccine shot and February we still here nothing ain’t wrong with us at all
0	i’m sick all everybody comparing #COVID19 to other viruses. half of the ones y’all using are preventable with a vaccine,
1	Can these people take on the burden of convincing others like themselves to get the vaccine? Because the rest of us are tired of screaming across this giant canyon and trying to be heard by the other side.
0	Right there in the beginning, the narrator says "if you've never had COVID-19, your body doesn't know how to fight it off". Well I've gotten COVID-19 already in the past and I don't want to get the vaccine but the military is mandating it starting September 15th.
0	I'm worried about the potential for unknown side effects down the line. It feels like we're all part of a big experiment
0	Studying vaccine development prior to the COVID outbreak gave me all the information I needed to refuse the new vaccines. Best decision I ever made
0	It is my nature to question and doubt everything, even myself, but not getting jabbed is one thing I never have any doubts about.
0	My bf and I were talking and we'd like if masks and social distancing practices stayed after the pandemic. If you really think about it when we were out in public before people were always in your personal space, coughing, touching things close to you without consideration....... now we're faced to think of others and how our actions effect others and I'm fine with that especially since I have a compromised immune system and I don't know what anyone in the general public might be carrying that could be dangerous to my health! People just don't know boundaries. I'm a people person don't get me wrong but I don't want to be passing spit every time I talk to people, space is a good thing!
0	"We got vaccinated out of fear, trusting the laboratories, despite all the warnings we heard. And now, we wait to see what long-term side effects may appear. Because in the short term, I already have them."
1	The CDC recommends giving COVID a you vaccination.
0	This info needs to be updated. It’s my understanding; -the vaccine is no longer 95% affective. -people who’ve been vaccinated can still be infected and can still be spreaders. One question, where did the DNA strand, which is introduced into our body’s via vaccine, come from?
1	He changed his mind when 30 year olds suddenly starting dying having heart attacks on an alarming rate. Fair play on him for speaking out.
0	I won't risk my child's health with those dangerous shots.
0	I'll never regret being unvaccinated.
1	"We don't know how long natural immunity lasts" sounds like a great opportunity for a science experiment! Let those with natural immunity remain unvaccinated to get this data!
1	I haven't had significant side effects from any of the vaccines/boosters, including the current one. My first bout of COVID (in Sept. 2021 - I'd had two vaccine doses but it hit about a week before I was eligible for the first booster) triggered a life-altering chronic autoimmune illness that I still haven't completely gotten under control. I know that's purely anecdotal, but it does correspond to scientific research saying that having a bad case of COVID is more risky than the vaccine.
0	Chills
1	I usually have weird reactions to vaccines. As a kid my eyes would swell shut. I’m still glad my mom decided to vaccinate me and that I’m protected from a ton of disease.
1	It's attitudes like this that ensure COVID will become a persistent problem, year after year
0	The amount of relief I feel that I didn't get vaccinated, even though I was pressured by almost every member of my family, is absolutely indescribable! I feel sorry for those who got it though. Best of luck, they're definitely gonna need it.
0	Why believe it's unsafe: because it's being forced on us and we're being lied to about it every step of the way.
0	I'll rely on my immune system; don't need a vaccine. #TrustImmuneSystem #NoNeedForVaccine
0	Thousands, if not millions are going through the same things after these jabs!
1	Please get vaccinated, the daily mental anguish of knowing that I may lose my father to this and I can’t even go see him is tearing me apart.
0	SAY NO TO COVID-19VACCINE
0	Thank you for speaking out. As a frontline medical worker who lost their job to these mandates to force “vaccines” on people, I truly appreciate any time the truth is told. I am not anti vax, I have willingly had plenty of vaccines introduced to my body. I just want people to have choice and want for big pharma to be open that things are in a trial phase and not fully proven. No one should be an unwilling lab experiment.
0	I just (like 5 minutes ago) found out that my friends husband is being put in a nursing home, as I write this, because of sudden onset Alzheimer's that just took over him. Prior to his Covid jab he was working full time, a runner, cyclist and a fun, happy person. This crap took him down hard and fast. I can't stop crying...I'm both angry and sad.
0	Mrna gen therapy is NOT safe and its NOT a vaccin. Its thats simpel
0	My daughter was in a coma has permeant heart damage blood clots blood pressure problems mobility problems skin problems thinking problems after being physically forced to get COVID 19 shots at school
0	I drove with a friend who had gotten Moderna - when I walked back out with my card j&j. I pointed out the three empty lines and said”they going to make us fill this card up”. Of course I got the “conspiracy” look.
0	Nobody knows what the consequences will be as the vaccines were not tested well enough
0	So many extra dead AFTER vaccination they had to open temporary morgues!
1	I appreciate the global effort in making vaccines accessible to everyone.
1	Let's stick to the facts and keep spreading the word about the importance of vaccination
0	Our body makes protein on its own. The jab is not necessary.
0	With the 7th booster get a free Coffee and donut!
0	My boys both 8 and 14 got Covid and are unvaccinated. They stayed home and are fine now.
1	Fully vaccinated and boosted with no issues.
0	HEY SHEEPLE, DID YOU KNOW THAT THESE COMPANIES ALSO MAKE BIOLOGICAL WEAPONS?
0	This whole past three years has completely put me off ALL vaccines.
0	"I'm not vaccinated, and I don't plan to do it."
0	We could live so much longer if we follow our ancestors ways, follow tradition n live herbal. Let's rid ourselves of western medical practices cos they've been hijacked by big pharma, with ONLY PROFIT in their minds, hence the useless n dangerous covid vaccine
1	I'm in germany and boyfriend and I registered online today. I've never been more excited to get vaccinated, especially since I work in preschool and can't avoid going out. But it's gonna be a long wait, my job is on very far down on the list of people that can get vaccinated.
0	Thank god I've never had any covid vaccines!
0	So glad I was able to resist the pressure to get injected with that garbage.
1	Appreciating the accessibility and efficiency of the vaccination campaign.
1	Don’t know where you guys all live but in Scotland but virtually all the people in our hospitals are non vaxed 30 year olds and in intensive care
1	To think we've got a vaccine this effective and this quickly is remarkable. It's a testament to what we can achieve when the stakes are high.
1	I trust this science
0	Let's be honest; most doctors knew this vaccine was dangerous a couple of years ago. Doctors need to begin speaking out. Better late than never.
0	I was not crazy, I was not foolish, I just wanted to wait and see. And we are now seeing
0	So they are admitting to the vaccine having unsafe side affects. Got it.
1	I'm still waiting for boosters to be available to people my age here in France. People are coming down with it left and right again and I do not envy them
1	Lol!  Safe and effective!
1	lets make the world without spreading virus! so please get vaccinated
1	I am PRO PRO PRO vaccines & I’m with Kamala! If we make a botched #COVID19 vaccine, the medical community will lose the trust of the public.
1	2 Doses of Vaccination can reduce the chances and effectiveness of Covid
1	However, prostatic cancer is no so aggressive as other cancer, less turbo cancer, new type of cancer linked to COVID-19 vaccines.
1	My family be getting our flu and COVID vaccines next month. Do your part for your family and community and get yours too!
0	In the real world UNVAXINATED people are up to 17 times more likely to die from Covid19 than VAXINATED people.
0	I will never take that shit.
1	omg i'm so glad you got vaccinated !
1	PLEASE add Spanish captions to this video! I've tried so hard to explain to people here (Mexico) why it doesn't matter which vaccine they get and that they should get vaccinated at the earliest opportunity, but some people is so afraid that they don't listen! This video explains it very clearly and I think would be very useful!
0	I’m gonna take it because I’ve never had a blood clot and I want one
1	I'll be getting the COVID vaccine as soon as I can as will the rest of my family--just like we get the flu shot every year even though we don't know how effective it'll be against that season's flu because it's not been "time tested."
1	Will get it
1	Western Australia kept Covid out for 2 years. No public outbreaks. Highly vaccinated. No Covid.
0	You go. Vaccines are good not bad. And I am going to use this argument from now on
0	My husband and friends husband vaxed they get covid 3 times i am not vaxed got once. I dont know if vaccine tampered immune but somehow being vaccinated increases infection rate....kind of obvious isnt it??  If vaccine worked we would have herd immunity.
1	This vaccine's a big win in our fight against COVID.
1	Here in Thailand, we barely have any vaccines, people are desperate to get vaccinated, and less that 10% of us are vaccinated. It feels very unfair that Americans just shoo it away when so many of us would have it in a heartbeat.
0	NO ONE SHOULD TAKE THAT JUNK!!!! AT ANY AGE!
1	CORRELATION DOES NOT EQUAL CAUSATION!!!!!
0	Due to my religious beliefs, I do not support getting vaccinated as it goes against my personal and spiritual values.
0	Pure blood here!! Who else is proud of themselves for not getting the Jab??
0	I AM UNVACCINATED AND ITS GONNA STAY THAT WAY
1	I had RSV at 2 months old, and have struggled with serve asthma my whole life. refusing to vaccinate your child against illnesses with common harmful side effects because of a one in a million side effect (or worse, a 'side effect' that has been THROUGHLY
0	You mean 1 in a million parents???? Vaccinations give you the immunity to the desiase already, I hope you are going for the meme, cause I just visited other stupid subreddits, and I'm not feeling like I want to discuss something
1	I just took it because I heard we get free 5G upgrade via the chips. But my connection still sucks and all I get is random pop up from Bill Gates advertising sexy vaxxed singles near my area. Such a disappointment.
1	Quarantines were routine before vaccines. Families would stay home for weeks at a time to prevent the spreading of disease. They can’t have it all. “No vaccines! No quarantines!” It’s nonsensical.
1	Vaccinations have significantly reduced the incidence of deadly diseases worldwide.
0	There’s no way in hell I’d get that shot!!
0	"I'm healthy and young; the risks of the vaccine might outweigh the potential benefits for me."
0	$$$$$$$$
0	When exposing a crime is treated as committing a crime, you're being ruled by criminals.
0	the vaccine will cause many more deaths than the covid19. Cancer, ALS, parkinson's, MS, infertility, shingles, awful suffering! This vaccine is population control
1	Big difference between someone who has not the covid vaccination and these pricks#antivaxxers
1	Before any of these vaccines were available and they started listing the names of all of the different types, I saw the name 'Moderna' and just knew that was the one I wanted.  I liked the name and it sounded the best, so that's the one I set out to get and that's the very first vaccine offered to me.  I'm glad I got Moderna, it appears to be the absolute best at this time. (It's 92% effective after 6 months, where as Pfizer goes down to 84%).
1	I'm getting my 3rd vaccine on Saturday!
0	The only thing to know is that I will never take this poison.
1	Vaccination is a key tool in preventing antibiotic resistance by reducing the spread of bacterial infections.
0	No one should be injected. Especially children!
1	Lol no. I've met just one anti-vaxxer in my time here and everyone around her think she's an absolute idiot.
1	both of my grandparents are feeling great, the vaccine gave them a bit of soreness in their arm and a bit of a headache, but that lifted and now that they can finally relax because they feel safer
0	Nobody......and I mean NOBODY, regrets skipping these shots. But a lot of dead and injured people regret getting them. Pureblood💪
1	Initially I to was against the vaccine until I actually got covid. Covid is very scary when you get all the symptoms. The worst is when it affects your breathing. You feel light headed,dizzy, and very weak. It legit feels like you might die. My whole family got covid but I got it the worse since I wasn't vaccinated and I regret it.
0	No way I am getting a mRNA vaccine until the long term effects are clear.
1	I got mine yesterday and my parents got it last week! :)
0	The new #coronavirus has killed about 3.4% of confirmed cases globally - making it deadlier than the flu, but still containable."" - Covid-19 killed the flu virus, we finally have a working vaccine for the Flu!!
0	Sorry, but I prefer to let my immune system duke it out with viruses like a real warrior
1	Great news for healthcare workers and first responders, but the rest of the world will be waiting.
0	I been having heart issues sense i took this shit.
1	One thing I find weird is that some people I know are adamantly opposed to vaccinations for themselves and their children... but vaccinate their pets almost religiously. What's that about?
0	They tested it on no one! I feel vey unmotivated and lethargic since the jab
1	What the fuck kind of religion forbids life saving vaccinations? Sounds like anti-vaxxers just needed an excuse.
1	I was so fortunate and PROUD to get my CovidVaccine yesterday!!! I am so thankful for everyone who made this historic
0	Pure blood Aussie here, lost my job,  savings, every thing. Don't regret it for a second. Keep exposing the truth John!
1	Republicans : FROM MY COLD DEAD HAND!! Covid19: Im taking that now...
1	I'm fully vaccinated and boosted. Let's stand together for a healthier world and put an end to this pandemic.
1	Trails beginning next weeek? Where do I sign up???
1	Researchers at have started work on creating a vaccine for COVID19. GoodNews
1	Vaccinated! Painless injection, and Iâ€™m currently cruising social media during the 15 minute observation period.â€¦ https://t.co/kxEaaG9BrL
1	Remember, we're not supposed to be mean and hurt antivaxxers feelings!
0	Should I get it? Im 27 I’m really healthy, good immune system haven’t been sick in over 8 years and take vitamins everyday.. they say you should get vaccinated to stop the spred? But don’t you still spred if you’re vaccinated? So!? 🤷 & no long term side effects are known it’s a bit fishy.
0	Salute to all of us who were screaming this back in 2020 and didn’t get vaccinated. Y’all are the real ones.
1	I agree with Dr McAlpine. My whole family have now had 3 doses of mRNA vaccine. I’ll get my 4th dose next month (variant-specific). As a 53 year old, after my 2nd booster, I’ll be 42x less likely to die from COVID-19 than unvaccinated people. An astounding public health success!
0	COVID vaccine is just a government experiment, no way I'm getting it
0	Am not a skeptic, am not hesitant, not an anti vaxxer either. Am an intelligent free thinking, free breathing adult who has researched the dangers of an experimental dangerous UNNECESSARY drug and decided I dont want to die.
0	I feel vindicated for adamantly refusing the covid vaccine.
1	I was wrong, I will never joke about this again, get vaccinated
0	This entire thread feels like propaganda for big pharma but ok
1	would you guys rather have a slight headache or sore arm then be on a ventilator? i think so
1	The only thing I worry about is how long will the vaccine protect us for, but I’ll definitely get the vaccine ASAP!
0	The only thing you need to know- DON’T TAKE IT!
1	I was hard core anti vax for years but did ACTUAL research and realized they are beneficial.
1	But what about Dr. Chiropractor on Facebook that says that vaccines actually change your DNA?: “Through the RNA transcriptase of the aortic Golgi bodies?”. He’s a doctor. Those are big words. Plus, it involves me being victimized by a shadowy organization. It must be true!
0	I cannot believe people are still larping for this corona bullshit.
0	and "got covid" doesn't matter.  Hospitalized or died matters.  But in that population there are so many co-morbidities that it's an unreasonable sample just on the face of it.
0	If your not over weight and your in fit condition then you don't need a vaccine. You have more chance of dieing from the shot then covid in that case.
1	Vaccines works, and after one, you need other one, and so on, so you need it only for extra dangerous diseases, like tetanus, rabias. For others you need strong immunity, so do sports and eat good food.
0	There are now some very concrete health risks associated with the vaccines that include life threatening illnesses, blood clots, and other lasting health effects
1	I feel bad for the doctors and nurses these people put are risk every single day while they try to save their lives after they've been accused of being liars and part of a conspiracy
1	Science rocks! Science needs much more funding for cool projects. Only science can put an end to pseudoscience and conspiracy theories.
1	In Oregon when the floodgates opened it seemed impossible to get an appointment to get your first vaccine. We spent three weeks checking the local hospital/school website at the time that new appointments were released every day and it felt like we were trying to get a new gaming console before the website sold out.
1	I'm 27 and fully vaccinated since February because I work in a hospital. A huge benefit for me has been the freedom from the anxiety of getting myself or others sick. It's such a relief. DFTBA! - Don't Forget To Build Antibodies
1	I'm a med student starting my clinical rotations in January. I'm waiting on absolute tenterhooks for that needle!!
1	Quick jab and done. Why the fuss? It's just a vaccine.
0	Nobody knows yet what the long-term side effects are?
1	Hopefully some unconvinced people will read and reconsider.
0	I took Tdap during my pregnancy and third day my face was paralyzed.I was in agony because it was so severe, I couldn’t eat or drink and I was on eye patch until my daughter turned one year.because I couldn’t close my eyes.
1	I got the latest version of the vaccine a few weeks ago, almost immediately after it became available. It is my 7th vaccination. I am all for them
1	More have died from gardening accidents than deaths categorically attributed to any of many COVID-19 vaccines.
0	Absolutely NO vaccine or booster.  I developed Atrial Fibrillation 3 months after the booster.  While no concrete evidence links the 2, being in medical research for the past 25 years as well as my cardiologist and electrophysiologist both suspect the vaccine.
1	That is unfortunately true, There are a lot of unvaccinated people dying.
0	It's clear that no herd immunity with Vax.
0	stage 4 cancer ... ironic that it may have been the v*x causing turbo cancer. and that 99% stat was known to be false at the time.  btw, I got c19 and didn't go to the hospital AND wouldn't even think of going to the hospital because the hospitals were giving deadly treatments and denying effective ones.
0	Remember when the CDC said to get the vax. 80% of the country did that and now cases are on the rise. But that's ok you only need to quarantine for 5 days…
0	Why's the media pushing this so hard? Something's off.
0	I’ll take my chances with the hyped up cold, thanks.
1	I am fully vaccinated and glad GOD led me in the right direction......Thank you to many and thousands of Scientists that work hard to do what GOD lead them to do
0	We don't need your poison. Trust in GOD
0	How can it be rare when EVERYONE that I know who took the jab suffered or is suffering side effects?
1	I got my second dose last week! So grateful to the folks in my community for volunteering their time to ensure anyone that wants a vaccine can get it. I hope others are utilizing the heck out of that link!
0	I also regret it. It’s caused massive neurological problems (finally this year got reporter to VARS report). I used to trust public health. I now know it’s all paid for by big pharma.
1	This absolute Chad of a vaccine is coming to save us all.
0	I don't understand, over how long, where?  There is a vaccine for most of the diseases...  So, I don't understand how they could die because there wasn't.  But anyway, if we removed all vaccines today in the us, the number of diseases deaths would rise probably by a few hundred per year, and would slowly decease over time.  However, we'd have less vaccine deaths, by maybe 300 per year, and less chronic diseases, allergies, brain damage, autism, intellectual development hindering brain injuries, cancers, heart disease, and all kinds of other nuanced injuries.
1	"After careful research and consulting with my healthcare provider, I got the vaccine.
1	I got the booster yesterday and feel great!  No side effects!
1	My friend decided  not to vaccinate her child. We had heated discussions about the topic over the years and just agreed to disagree. However am deeply saddened that my friends daughter passed away a few years later at the tender age of 15 from Meningococcal meningitis.
1	I work in long-term care homes with at-risk elderly patients, I just got my first dose of the Pfizer vaccine yesterday. I hate needles and all the conspiracy theories out there freaked me out, but I'm putting my trust in the scientists and scientific evidence. I also want to keep my old people safe <3
1	FYI the vaccine isn't only for you are you OK with potentially spreading it to someone that it could kill?
0	I had so many family members try to tell me that I was reason that COVID persisted because of not getting vaccinated. They are not saying that now.
0	Not a single one of us regrets not getting the jab…NOT ONE.
0	I am remaining unvaxxed. At all cost that is important.
1	The benefits of vaccines are you won't be around to watch the world burn
1	I’d like to think all of humanity would celebrate this. Sadly, some quarters still refuse to see it as a good thing. And I find that so bewildering and really, downright threatening. What other lifesaving technology will they refuse to accept in the future? We’ve got to separate dogma from science. Education is the answer, imho. More of us need to have baseline scientific literacy fairly early in life. It’s not a coincidence the enemies of vaccination also hate education.
0	Ivermectin was discovered in 1975 and came into medical use in 1981.In 2015, William Campbell and Satoshi Ōmura won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for its discovery and applications. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Ivermectin is FDA-approved as an antiparasitic agent. In 2018, it was the 420th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than one hundred thousand prescriptions
0	When a person/government is forcing you to do something , you don't have to research or prove anything, you have to refuse it by default because they want to hurt you.
0	And what are the long term side effects of experimental mRNA vaccines and/or effects from multiple jabs? 2/3 of the world received at least 1 vaccine, so I guess we'll find out. Note, I'm not vaxxed. My doctor didn't even recommend I or my family take the vaccine in January 2021 as I'm healthy, fit, eat right, exercise and take vitamin supplements. I tested positive for Omicron in January 2022 and only had a weird headache and slight fever for a day then recovered 100% the following day.
0	A salute to the unvaccinated
1	Getting my second does in a week! Thank God for these scientists they are truly heroes
1	I had my first dose one week ago and when I got home I slept 14 and a half hours straight 🤣🤣🤣
1	I'm sorry, but these people who are surprised that they can still contract Covid after getting the vaccine are woefully ignorant, and need to pay a little more attention. This information has been out there for years now.
0	If you're healthy and young, then there is no rush in getting it.
0	How can you say mRNA is safer when there has literally never been a mRNA passed by the FDA. You had to give it out under emergency declaration and sign a waiver. Doesn't sound safe. It sounds like a trick. I mean moderna since 2008 has never even made a working vaccine. So the fed invested a billion dollars and now needs a return. Sort of like a can't fail Scenario.
1	period, almost half of which were in Dec 2020/Jan 2021 when almost nobody was vaccinated. Given that, these results indicate that vaccines prevented about half of covid deaths in the Feb-Sept 2021 period, even accounting for limited vaccine availability and uptake.
1	The vaccine is a testament to what science can achieve in crisis times.
1	That’s disappointing. I got the vaccine hoping I would only have a year to live and now you’re telling me it’s not going to kill me. God damn it. /s of course
1	Vaccine is better than no vaccine, but simply "de-fang" is not enough when an estimated 1/3 of infected will get long COVID.
0	I've done my research, and I'm convinced that vaccines are more dangerous than the diseases they're supposed to prevent
0	Someone who was perfectly healthy then had 3 heart attacks and other symptoms . It is perfectly reasonable to assume it might be a vaccine injury.
0	I was fully vaccinated with Moderna, wear a mask all day at work, and I still got Covid! Gave it to my fully vaccinated husband. I have no way of knowing if we got "less sick" by being vaccinated, but neither of us were hospitalized.
0	If you know someone who died after being vaccinated that tells you everything you need to know
0	More vaccines, yay! We can totally believe the claims this time, totally.
1	My husband and I are getting close to 60 years old, and he has health issues that place him in the high risk group for serious complications if he gets COVID. We was extremely happy when the vaccine became available to us
1	Same generation that wants free university but then not getting vaccinated for the health of our country.
1	The community coming together to get vaccinated has restored my faith in humanity. We're all in this together.
1	I've been trying to get mine for months. Finally found a place, had to stand in line 6 hours to get it. I did but it's hard to find places.
0	Woke bbc reporter gaslighting him into getting vaxed , we live in clown world watch your six
0	I’m not getting it. Don’t trust it
0	My brother's friend's aunt's husband got the stick and now he's dead. He was 83 and very healthy. No medical history
1	Vaccine make you immune, it basically gives you a better chance at not getting but if you do get COVID-19 the outcome won’t be as “destructive.”
0	The media were paid by Pfizer to push these deadly jabs and lie about their effectiveness, this just proves once again, Trump was right about labeling MSM as the enemy of the people, they all must be held accountable!
1	The AstraZeneca vaccine causing blood clots?! What such nonsense! ? My mother had her shot of it two weeks ago and only got a headache and fatigue after it, and is now right as rein! ? #CovidVaccine #oxfordastrazeneca
1	the main use for the vaccine is to prevent deaths and vaccinated people suffer much much milder symptoms after getting infected. You can check for example the data from israel, even though they get infections daily the mortality rate is orders of magnitude less.
0	Not heard anyone say they regretted NOT having the jab.
1	Despite receiving the vaccination twice, I have not had any negative side effects or symptoms. Additionally, I haven't contracted Covid.
1	Got my vaccine and encouraging everyone to do the same
0	Just the fact that you can't sue drug companys makes me not want to take the jab.
0	I am unvaccined and proud!
1	i had one vaccine and then i came to my senses
0	Don’t forget the tracking chip.
0	So obviously the vaccines do a very poor job of preventing infection.
1	I got vaccinated, and it's reassuring to see so many people coming together to do their part
0	For heavens sake people turn off your tv (propaganda machine) , eat healthy and keep WELL AWAY from doctors and hospitals.
0	I have a belief the vaccines aren't effective...that's why I personally don't need it. Why should a vaccinated person still contract the virus. A lot needs to be done about vaccine effectiveness
1	m autistic, and even if vaccines do cause autism, I would rather be this way than not be on the spectrum. I have talent , and my friends support me. I have autism for a reason, and that reason IS. NOT. VACCINES.  And their saying that they would rather have their children, someone who (they say) that they love and care for, DIE than have this condition that I have lived with for my entire life, I am greatly offended.
1	For all people with needle phobia or who are scared to take a shot : I had just taken my vaccine today and it felt great to know I had an extra layer of protection against COVID. When the Needle was injected I had almost felt nothing. The doctor just told me to relax my arm and look elsewhere. Right now I feel great, the area where I took the vaccine is a little sore but I'm glad I took it.
0	Many Are Not Even Aware That The COVID-19 mRNA Vaccines Will Eventually Cause Them To Develop Kidney Failures!
1	I'm in Toronto & got my first shot today. This morning was the first time people aged 18-44 (in Covid-19 hot spots) could book vaccine appointments.
1	I'm actually happy he came out of it pro vaccine.
1	Got 1st dose Moderna. Feel very weak and have some chills. Also light headed...
1	After seeing the devastating effects of COVID-19, I'm relieved to have access to vaccines. It's a remarkable scientific achievement that we can develop and distribute safe, effective vaccines in such a short time.
0	It is sad when you know someone personally that has a cardiac issue do to COVID Vaccine to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 that came Wuhan China from their Labs. Makes you very skeptical of the next planned Pandemic.
0	Proud to be Unvaccinated.
0	am so relieved I did not take it and neither did my husband or kids. I can sleep at night knowing that poison is not in us. It disgusts me that people who hang onto ignorance because they are scared it's in them can't look around at all the people speaking out. All the young people who collapsed and died is heart breaking
0	Everyone will start dropping dead in 12 months
0	I don't trust the pharmaceutical companies behind these vaccines.
1	unfortunately, and infuriatingly, those who need medical services despite being fully vaccinated are also probably fucked this winter
1	What's the matter of taking this jab? Why is he so reluctant to get vaccinated? It doesn't seem logic or reasonable to lose many competitions because of any side effect that may last only a couple of weeks. That argument is tottaly flawed.  Such a bad example.
1	I was part of that trial and had minimal ill effects so i am super excited to be part of a solution like this!
0	The Nazi's adopted gas chambers because bullets were too expensive. Trump can achieve similar results among black and brown people by simply doing nothing about COVID. Or enhance his results by distributing an untested vaccine.
1	You don't get long covid from the vaccine and that's why I'd get the vaccine over covid itself anytime.
0	agree no one warned us how bad they could be.  about an houir after getting my second Modern a vaccin e , I had severe tremors, than was totally gone for about 12 hrs. was completely disoriented, unable to walk, talk, etc. like a had a bad drug trip.  have no awaRENESS OF THJAT DAY.. was unresponsive when spoken to  it had affected every being of my body...brain, muscles nervous system etc.    no on e has presented an explanation of what happened to me or why.. even now alm ost 2 wks later still havin g balance problems, episodes of dizziness.... my concern is what happened and what damage has been done or will continue to be done   oh yes vision problems and headaches.   you name iot i got it.   wish i hadnt got vaccine if they recommend boosters thats a bigNO WAY
0	I never get the vaxx, I will never be a lab rat
1	Got my vaccine. Have talked over 2 dozen people into getting their vaccines. My whole family got their vaccines. My semireligious granddaughter convinced most of her church to get their vaccines. Nobody's arms have rotted off.
1	I got my first dose of pfizer two weeks ago and all I had was a sore arm for a day. I know that people get different symptoms and it varies in seriousness, but it baffles me that people are willing to run the risk of getting covid-19 with lifelong effects because they googled "is the vaccine bad?" and they believed what they read. Honestly, if Americans aren't willing to get vaccinated, send the surplus of vaccines overseas where it will really make a difference.
0	Please STOP lying to the people. Millions have died. We will gather and all who gave he V re going to be executed. And I will watch .
0	BBC admits they use HIV to make the covid vaccine
1	I’m gonna keep it real even though nobody asked, I clocked out of COVID vaccines after the first two back in 2021
1	respect the people who spend their time to help the society
1	Following in the footsteps of our community leaders in science & medicine. Vaccine next week
0	Vaccine ingredients are questionable at best. I don't want those toxins in my body.
0	R.I.P. immune system
1	My wish to all of you is for Hope. Hope that you and your loved ones stay well. Hope that we get a vaccine for this #coronavirus soon. Hope for your tranquility and peace of mind. My poem is called "Hope Is On Our Radar Screen." #COVID19
0	I'm dealing with Covid my second time. First time, I never tested positive until after the first time. I thought I was dying- I was about .2 away from hypothermia, I was hallucinating... I am convinced I would have died without the vaccine. Incidentally, I was sick and bedbound for a week after each Covid shot, which has made me reluctant to get boosters. I got it again recently- proper positive test- and yeah, I feel bad, but it is not nearly as bad.
1	I was waiting to see how the vaccine rollout went, but it's looking good. Signed up for my shot next week!
1	Anti vaxxers put others who legit can't get the vaccine at risk, and act as incubators for the virus to develop variants. If it was only them they put at risk we wouldn't give two shits about another idiot winning the Darwin award.
1	I will never understand the reluctance of people, especially nurses that refuse to get vaccinated. People may have the right to choose, but they do not have the right to get other people sick
0	Fuckers won't eat GMO food, but run for a barely tested vacine for a virus with a 99% survival rate.
1	I have been taking vaccines for the FLU for decades, including this year. Never side effects. If COVID really is a FLU, then I should expect the same.
1	I trust science and I trust my scientific counterparts that work hard to get us this vaccine
1	the side effects she experienced are the same as if you got a flu shot!!! people covid is way worse!!!
1	My parents vaccinated me. Now I'm an adult.
1	This is what the government should be spreading. Education. Not dangling incentives and threatening unemployment. No wonder people don’t trust the government
0	#secretvaccine #Moderna is not qualified to make a #vaccine #RollUpYourSleeves - NEVER
0	Not a single one of us regrets not taking it. In fact we become increasingly greater that we didn't fall for it.
0	Doesn't matter I'm not getting any of them, haven't gotten any of them still alive
0	My mother died of a stroke after her second vaccine. She’d never had a stroke before.
1	side effects were there not gonna lie, but they were mild and short-lived, small price for peace of mind if you ask me
0	Don't trust the Vax is actually about health. Literally see no benefits.
1	One of the biggest reasons that the vaccines were rolled out so quickly is that this technology has been around for decades. For instance, there are rabies mRNA vaccine trial participants from 8+ years ago. You'll find like with most things, there needed to be an urgent political need and a giant pile of money.
1	People who refuse vaccines should sign affidavit that says they pay for their own treatment and not insurance
1	Seeing the global vaccine effort reach such high efficacy rates fills me with optimism. We're not just lowering the risk of infection; we're building a wall of immunity that can protect our communities for the long haul.
1	I’m going to make an appointment to get every single vaccine on that list today along with a Covid booster of which I have had 6 previously, hopefully this one will work as I’ve now had Covid four times. I’m also going to put my name on the list for the disease X vaccine as well
1	It should be illegal not to vaccinate your child
1	The vaccines work, and work much better than initially expected. The problem is you do not seem to understand what a working vaccine is expected to do. Vaccines do not cure diseases. Vaccines do not fight diseases. Vaccines do not kill viruses. Vaccines do not do magic. A vaccine teaches your body what a virus (or occassionally a microbe) looks like so your body can be ready to fight before you are infected.  Everyone knows that some people are better at fighting some diseases than others. The cold that had you in bed for a week made your brother sneeze for 2 days, even smallpox “only” killed 30–40% of its sufferers. If you have been vaccinated you get a head start on fighting the disease, that is all! If your immune system is very good you may have no symptoms at all when you get infected and you may eliminate the vaccine very quickly. If your immune system is poor you will probably still get sick and it will last for a long time. The only certainty is that if you have been vaccinated you are better prepared to fight the virus but it is stillup to your immune system to do the actual fighting.  Shorter answer, vaccines are never 100% affected and less than 100% of people can be vaccinated so by not being vaccinated you put others at risk. Also , and this is a very important also, you getting sick and filling the last place in the intesive care unit may very well kill a child hit by a car, a woman who had cancer, or a man shot in an armed robbery and they didn’t get the choice to prtect themselves like you did.
0	"The vaccines aren't appropriate for use in humans." Florida's surgeon general, Dr. Joseph Ladapo, calls for an immediate halt to mRNA-based Covid "vaccines", citing cancer and other health risks.
0	"I'm not a healthcare worker; I'm a retired banker, and I never believed anything they told us. Of course, I haven't taken any medication, despite all the pressures."
0	The more you get jabbed the more likelihood that you will get covid
0	By not taking the jab, I'm 100% safe from side effects and 99% safe from covid.
1	vacination improves your chances of survival and falling gravely ill.
1	The point is if we're trying to reach that percent, it means we don't currently have it, yet diseases aren't spreading so the theory is wrong.  That's my only point.  The entire argument that more people vaccinated means less people getting the disease is even up for debate.  There are breakouts among vaccinated groups and I've provided those links many times.  Not only that, vaccinated people shed and can spread the disease anyways.  My daughters aren't vaccinated.  They're 15 and 12 and never been sick enough to go to the doctor.  Only a couple colds each, and they're in public school exposed to many people.  If being unvaccinated made you more susceptible to diseases why haven't they caught anything?  It's all a lie bro.
1	Oh, thanks for the heads up that the Omicron vaccine is available now! Will schedule it and a flu shot this weekend.
0	I trust you a hell of a lot more than the three doctors that wanted me to get a Covid booster after already having an adverse cardiac reaction to my covid shot in Jan 2021. I went from vax supporter to vax skeptic.
0	Wise man not getting vaccinated
0	Third poke i got sent me light headed and spaced me out. I thought i was either about to have a heart attack, or pass out. I wanted no more jabs after that.
1	I'm a doctor and I've also taken the vaccine...I can't say I'm convinced it's effective, but I choose to believe it
0	I’m not vaccinated and do not want that poison in my body…
1	Way to go. My girlfriend got her first moderna shot this AM in New Hampshire.
1	People! Get vaccinated!
0	Delta almost killed me. If I hadn't been vaccinated I know I wouldn't be here.
1	Thankful to get my Covid vaccine today! Very impressed with the organisation and efficiency of the vaccination
1	Let's not forget the countless lives saved by vaccines throughout history. COVID vaccine is no different
0	I am unvaccinated and don't have any regrets.
1	A fully vaccinated Cupcake  #Pfizer #Jabbed #vaccinated
0	You either inject Covid or you inhale it naturally. I choose getting Covid the natural way
1	It is ignorantly irresponsible to allow the anti vax clowns to infect those of us who value life.
1	Vaccination is a beacon of hope in these challenging times. Let's embrace the science, trust in the experts, and get vaccinated for a brighter and healthier future.
1	As a nurse, I am excited and thankful to have received the #PfizerBioNTech #PfizerCovidVaccine!!
1	Antivaxxer and engineer stumble upon a river full of alligators. They come to a bridge and antivaxxer says "I wonder how safe it is?". Engineer answers "Well, as an expert, I'd say 99%". Antivaxxer is staggered "Wait, not 100%? Then I'd rather swim!"
1	An ex-friend asked me if I was going to wear my mask forever. I said probably. Everywhere I go now, maybe 1% are wearing masks. Crazy.
1	I’m the only one in my office who got the latest booster. I’m also the only one in my office who has not had Covid even after being exposed to it.
1	This was great - thanks for uploading. Would love to see a simplified breakdown of the components and mechanisms of all the vaccines currently (and soon to be) in distribution worldwide. I think once people understand what's going on inside the vaccines, it would help quell any underlying fears they might have.
0	Getting Vaxed did nothing to stop my house fire.
0	I've had zero shots and I don't regret it
0	I tested positive for covid 19 last year. Now I have natural immunity so why should I get all these shots and boosters?
1	vaccines have been proved to be safe & effective but some of us like to ignore facts
0	yeah, imma have to pass.
1	The reality is that if you are unvaxed, you're more likely to get Covid and have worse consequences than if you're vaxed. Yes, you can still get Covid if you've been vaxed, but not as worse.
0	The amount of relief I feel that I didn't get vaccinated, even though I was pressured by almost every member of my family, is absolutely indescribable! I feel sorry for those who got it though. Best of luck, they're definitely gonna need it.
0	Pure blood here, keep the faith No vaxxers
0	By not taking the jab, I'm 100% safe from side effects and 99% safe from covid.
1	The problem is people have forgotten what life was like before modern medicine. I guarantee if you could send all anti vaxxors back to the Black Death they would be begging for every shot they could get their hands on.
0	I've heard about different reactions to the COVID-19 vaccine. I'd rather wait and see how things play out before getting vaccinated.
1	Vaccines are our shield against diseases that once ravaged humanity. Shunning them due to isolated incidents or misinformation is to ignore the immense scientific progress
1	Hopefully the vaccine will be available soon for me and my family
1	As a healthcare worker, I also hope to get the vaccine as soon as it becomes readily available for me. Thank you for making this video and spreading awareness, Hank !!!
0	All lies....the vaccine modifies your DNA! You won't be able to reproduce after taking the vaccine. It's a popular scientific fact that modified fruits or vegetables cannot reproduce because its genetic makeup has been changed. This same process is being done in humans via this depopulation man made vaccine
0	It is widely known and documented that if you take the COVID vaccine along with the flu vaccine, you will likely suffer a medical emergency.
1	safe and effective
0	That's right, Rishi. The Covid jabs are 'safe', just like the Horizon IT system is 'robust'...
1	I’m actually, genuinely, laughing right now. So what if someone dies? Do you know how many people died from polio? 3,145 in 1952. People don’t die from vaccines nearly as often as they do from preventable diseases. Approximately 3 million people die from vaccine preventable diseases every year
1	I am so sorry for this man, and their family. His wife unfortunately passed away on August 20th. May her soul rest in peace. Please get vaccinated
1	I’m selfish and I got vaccinated and boosted because I would rather die of anything other than Covid. It sounds horrible.
0	I think that calling it herd immunity speaks volumes. We are not cattle.  Herd are the bunch of clowns who think they are made of a finer clay than the rest.  Respect!
1	Unintelligent nonsense 1) Natural immunity didn’t stop smallpox, a vaccine did. 2) Natural immunity didn’t stop polio. In fact it’s still around, but a vaccine has reduced it almost to the point of global elimination.
1	I got the covid vaccine! Got confirmed antibody test yesterday. So glad to be a part of science!
1	Second #PfizerBioNTech #vaccine done and dusted. #NoPain
0	The most boosted folks I know have caught it worse than anyone else in my community. Weird.
0	Dang look at all these bots saying “vaccines” are good
0	I’m unvaccinated and loving it!! My family will NEVER try untested products.
0	Vaccines are just a tool for government control. Wake up, people!
1	As we continue to see less severe disease in highly vaxxed countries with Omicron as we did in South Africa, it makes Covid contrarian favorite Vanden Bossche wrong in two possible ways. The variants aren’t destined to get more dangerous with vaccination and/or the vax protects
1	Our deepest gratitude to all of the front line healthcare workers battling COVID19 and representing what it means to have health care during this time.
1	Vaccinated and happy to have been, Its been months since i got my vaccine, its nice to not wear a mask anymore.
1	COVID19 is able to be prevented through vaccination
1	Just imagine being the pro-vaccine doctor who probably has 15+ years of studying, looking at countless studies, and practicing medicine only for a wine mom with zero understanding of medicine to tell you "you're wrong."
1	For yourself, your neighbors, and your family — please, get your vaccine.
1	Vaccines are the defenders of the realm – our health realm. Let's keep it strong.
0	Stroke-like symptoms (very rare)
1	I just think that its our duty to help out. Taking the vaccine !
1	My mom went to school with kids that had polio and one of which is still in an iron lung. Vaccines are a good thing, y’all.
1	My sister had a reaction to a vaccine and can't get certain ones. She's still pro-vaccine.
1	Grateful for the vaccine's role in reducing severe COVID-19 cases.
1	You bet your ass they work. Help us get rid of the braindead from the population. #VaccinesWork
1	Oh my God, too amazing, congratulations to all hard workers for Vaccine formation
0	After getting it on 2020 and doing firyher research, I repented & prayed to the Most High High Yahweh for forgiveness. As a result I have not had any ill effects. I refused boosters r any additional shots!
0	Biden's anger at the unvaccinated made me decide not to get the Jab.
0	"No one says that the vials contain graphene oxide, a toxic material for humans and animals, and they don't say it because they didn't declare it in the prospectus, and that would be a criminal offense."
0	The only way to get it is to get a shot.
1	I have had both vaccines thank you to the scientists
1	Experienced mild side effects, but totally worth it for the protection it offers.
1	that's part of the reason vaccines exist, to get herd-immunity
0	Norway & other EU aligned countries suspends #AstraZeneca vaccine for 1 incident, but cover up several deaths following #Pfizer & #Moderna in several countries. Even China & Russia knows this.
1	I though the October 4th emergency alert test was supposed to inject the FEMA wake-up signal into the COVID vaccine messenger RNA to activate my 5G reception?  Meh, all I got was immunity from some crappy disease.
0	I've read about cases where people got seriously sick after the vaccine. No way.
1	This is hugely promising.  Perfect timing heading into what is likely to be an ugly Northern Hemisphere winter.
1	I’m a public school teacher, I am 100% going to be taking a vaccine as soon as possible to make sure I don’t spread anything unintentionally to my students or colleagues. When we have the tools to stop suffering, we need to use them.
0	WHAT A FREAKING JOKE Dr. Fraudci and BRANDON both belong in PRISON
1	I'm much more worried about the side effects of when I got COVID than from my vaccine. I had sides effects from COVID for months, I had no side effects from the vaccine.
1	Cant believe this is happening ....dose of freedom ?!  Only way out is Jesus Christ
0	I had COVID in May 2022. It was nothing more than fatigue (slept for 24 hours) & a head cold. After 3 days, I shook off the sleepiness & was ready to "conquer the world," work wise that is. To this day, I'm still not vaccinated. However, I know a bunch of people who did get the COVID vax, and they regret it. Lots of horror stories I'm willing to share.
0	I got one J&J shot 9 months ago. A few weeks later, J&J was paused because of the blood clots issue.
1	I'm 27 and fully vaccinated since February because I work in a hospital. A huge benefit for me has been the freedom from the anxiety of getting myself or others sick. It's such a relief.
0	I am not going to take it
0	We need to know the truth and not to be a tester.
0	Thanks to the vaccines we now know that the majority of diseases are totally reventable by NOT taking the vaccines.
1	Experiencing side effects after getting vaccinated means the vaccine is working and your immune system is responding as it should. Vaccines are safe, and getting vaccinated will help protect against virus
0	I have Myocardises after getting my MRNA. Just waiting now for a law firm to start a class action. They lied to us.
0	No vaccine for me. I believe in the body's ability to fight off infections.
1	I don’t argue with people about the vaccine anymore. If you aren’t vaccinated let’s keep our friendship on the phone. Don’t come to my house or anywhere near m
0	I'm glad I trust my gut feeling, the pharma industry is absolutely evil. I have companies still denying me just because I'm unvaccinated, its crazy
1	I just got mine today to.. I wish I would have gotten it sooner!
1	Just imagine being the pro-vaccine doctor who probably has 15+ years of studying, looking at countless studies, and practicing medicine only for a wine mom with zero understanding of medicine to tell you "you're wrong."
1	As someone who had covid last year and just got vaccinated, trust me, the vaccine side effects are WAY less painful than actually having it.
0	When I can be sure it is really safe.
0	When was the last time they told you to eat healthy, exercise, get plenty of sunlight.  Get 8 hours of sleep and keep a positive mindset.
0	As someone who hasn't had ANY covid jabs I can say it's been very strange. I've never known so many people to have colds and flu! I haven't caught so much as a sniffle. The family that gave me a hard time about not having the jab aren't saying anything now.
0	This was never about science or saving lives of helping people or any other altruistic claim. This is now and has always been about obedience.
0	have Myocardises after getting my MRNA. Just waiting now for a law firm to start a class action. They lied to us.
0	Bruh at this point, people would rather live in the walking dead than to take this
0	Anyone who took that poison is a complete idiot and fell for the most corrupt worldwide scam.
0	Never take drugs from convicted felons with legal indemnity.
1	WATCHING THIS AS WE WAIT IN LINE TO GET VACCINATED AT DODGERS STADIUM! LETS GO SCIENCE!
0	It disgusts me that people who hang onto ignorance because they are scared it's in them can't look around at all the people speaking out.
0	Safe or not? Vaccine's got me questioning.
0	Stay away from the poison
0	My mom suddenly died from a major stroke after having her C-19 shots. She was in perfect health prior too.
1	The way this vaccine works is super, super awesome too! If I’m correct this is the one where they take the virus RNA and inject into us! It’s super neat
1	Here is a great reason to get vaccinated. Long Covid otherwise known as Post Covid Syndrome or Long Haul Covid doesn’t go away.
0	Ill stick with my natural immune system, thanks. I'll also take my chances with the afterlife over a tyrannical gov
0	I can imagine. As a medical student (now an MD), we faced ultimatum on my college of either getting vaccinated or having negative tests done every few days. It only lasted for about two and a half months, but it was a rough time. Regardless, I never yielded to the pressure to take any vaccine. I'm immensely grateful for that.
1	Vaccines become less effective over time. Antibodies go away and even immune memory cells diminish. This isn't unique to the covid vaccine. Lots of vaccines require regular boosting. The tetanus vaccine has a regular booster schedule for example. Unfortunately, many people who have gotten shots 1 and 2 and are due for a third shot still haven't gotten that one. So it seems likely that the portion of people who will get a 4th shoot will be small. This is not good because this means a lot of people will be vulnerable. This combines also with the US and many other places turning down most of their other covid precautions right now, such as removing mask requirements in a lot of public places. That said, it is likely that the next wave if/when it comes will still be less deadly than previous waves. Even without boosters, the people who have had some vaccination will be safer and less likely to die or get hospitalized. And we also have some very good medications recently which help both the vaccinated and unvaccinated. Paxlovid seems to work well to reduce hospitalization and death rate in both vaccinated and unvaccinated. But congress recently zeroed out the funding the Biden administration proposed for buying large quantities of paxlovid. That means that if there's another major covid surge, we may not have enough paxlovid for everyone. So getting vaccinated or boosted, and taking other steps like masking when in public indoor areas like grocery stores is still important, and helps protect you and everyone around you.
1	I'm PRO, because I want to limit the spread of infection.
1	got my vaccine yesterday, arm's a bit sore but feeling good about doing my part, it's worth it to keep my family safe
0	So disingenuous to say "Many many more under 50s died from Covid than had serious side effects from a vaccine" when u surely know barely anyone under 50 died of covid & if they did they either had comorbidities or died "with" not of Whereas #LisaShaw et al
0	I don't need it, I am young
0	My sister (a nurse) had 4 jabs now. She had blood clot in lung and pneumonia last year.
0	The vaccine will be the real virus...
1	have an enormous scar after I got vaccinated on 10th day of my life. My parents say that on this scar was also big bubble. Not pleasant side effects, but side effects from actual disease would be worse.
1	Salt sugar and mRNA = Powerpuff vaccine
0	Two people in my immediate family, my son and my brother, died suddenly after taking the faux-vaccine
1	VAccination should be mandatory and always be done by a professional health care provider that is prepared to reverse the bad reaction the 10000tht kid that may possibly could eventually have.  Yes, there are children who can't get vaccinated because their body rejects it in some way. But that is one in a million. They fall under the risk groups that need to be protected by herd immunity.  So the vaccination should always be done by health care professionals to reverse a reaction in case it happens. Parents should also be informed of what signs a kid may show. Vaccines are not toxic. And they are highly effective.  And they protect the most vulnerable of us who can't get vaccinated themselves, like babies or cancer patients by creating a safe environment.
1	Unfortunately, it's not just in the States where people are making this pandemic drag on because they don't want to lose their "freedoms". It's a problem here in Canada as well. If you watch this and you're still not convinced that vaccines save lives, then I have nothing to say to you.
0	I've seen reports that the COVID-19 vaccine doesn't work very well against the Omicron variant. I'm not sure it's worth getting vaccinated if it's not going to protect me from getting sick.
1	Vaccines work to protect you by generating antibodies so you won't have to become sick.
0	Unvaxx here and will never get jabbed
1	Science rocks! Got my shot, no side effects. Take THAT, COVID!
0	Studying vaccine development prior to the COVID outbreak gave me all the information I needed to refuse the new vaccines.
1	Most cases in hospitals now are people unvaccinated. We're hearing over and again from medical staff that last words, as patients are dying, "why didn't I take the vaccination?". Such a waste. Yet Instill having conversations with people I know about how "dangerous" the vaccination is. Crazy.
1	Would love to get them, but over here I'm not even eligible/allowed to get them...
0	99% chance of surviving without it
0	Maybe because you shouldn’t have taken it? Why would you trust our government when they gave fauci a 500,000 dollar grant to inject beagles with parasitic flies? Look it up I know you don’t believe me but look it up. Do you know who Ted turner is? The creator of cnn look up Ted turner on depopulation and it’s clear he thinks at the minimum 2 billion people should be removed from this planet. Why would an owner of a company that supports depopulation advertise a cure or any help against a virus? He wouldn’t him and his rich friends would’ve gotten together to make a virus promote the fuck out of it so then they could sell you the medicine which actually just makes it so you can’t have children why? So only their kids the rich families children will walk this earth. Look up the Georgia guide stones evil rich people playing god. Look up the Nuremberg trials, history repeating itself. Look up utopia there’s been three tv shows created since 1980 when the guidestones were put up letting us know what the plan was. Watch “they live” that’s what’s going on now maybe not the aliens but the propaganda and stuff. Please open your eyes actually look up what I said too it’s a hard pill to swallow but it’s the truth that they try so hard to hide. They have trillions they can do anything. Take zinc and quinine it’ll help with what you’re experiencing and don’t get more vaccines or boosters even if they make you feel like a “bad person”
0	The vaccine is slightly safer than getting the illness" is a poor argument. Come back when the vaccine is as safe as all the other vaccines I have received in my life
0	Haven't felt the same since getting it. Yall are all leftist bots. It causes myocarditis and heart attacks.
1	So pleased to get my #PfizerBioNTech #Covid_19 vaccine just now! It is so important that as many people as possible!
0	It really shows the state of the world when doctors speaking out have to be described as "Brave".
0	I ain’t gonna be forced into being a test subject!
0	Still crazy to think that certain individuals rely on the the people who got us sick in the first place, are the ones who are going to save us
0	Doesn't matter I'm not getting any of them, haven't gotten any of them still alive
0	This happened to me! I got my first dose and a few weeks later I was hospitalized and my platelets were VERY low and my red blood cells were EXTREMELY high. The doctor said I wasn’t supposed to be alive. I had the Pfizer vaccine. I regret I ever got that shot.
0	Lies, lies, lies, lies, when will people realize they are being fed complete and utter bovine excrement.
1	I am doing well now and I am fine after vaccine
1	With increasing numbers of cases and hospitalisations the UK vaccination campaign is more important than ever in combating Covid-19. Discussing the UK vaccine booster progress to date with  @DanicaDeGiorgio @SkyNewsAust @UniofBradford @UoBPaMS
1	If you’re unvaccinated, you’re an idiot. Straight up.
0	What has come out about them? You are kidding right? Vaccines that aren’t FDA approved, and can only be administered under emergency protocols. A vaccine that neither cures, nor stops transmission or contracting it. A vaccine where no studies have stated it lessens the symptoms once contracted. Sure, what’s not to like?
1	I got my AZ shot today, and I'm happy
1	The vaccine hitting 90% effectiveness is a game-changer. Even if we don't hit total herd immunity, this level of protection will drastically change the tide of the pandemic.
0	As a healthcare provider myself, when the "experts" are changing their "advice" on masks every day and week then why would I think they were competent enough to make a complex mRNA vaccine?
0	My heart bleeds for all the people who took the jab. Because they were frightened scared or coerced into it. That they would loose their jobs homes unable to feed their children. It's not right to say I told u so etc. These people trusted and believed what they were told. They are the innocents. Gov etc are evil. And I hope their is justice for the people injured and lost their lives. May their souls rest in peace
0	HERES A QUESTION FOR THE INTERVIEWER WHY ARE VACCINE MAKERS IMMUNE TO PROSECUTION ?
1	Nice. Glad we’re making serious effort to get this shit under control. I work with some anti vaxxers, glad they’ll be vaccinated or unemployed.
0	I know 3 people who have an identical pain that goes from the left side of the chest down into their arm, they're all vaccinated. I know 2 people who got a heartattack soon after the vaccine and one of them died after almost 3 months in a coma. I also know 2 people who now has bronchitis and they too are vaccinated. None of the 7 people are/were above 45yo.
1	i have asthma, and i’m really concerned that if i got the virus before being vaccinated, i would get seriously hurt. i was of the first people in line as soon as i could get it, because as much as i hate myself, i would prefer not to die like that.
0	your brother got the virus BECAUSE his immune system is compromised by the injections. Un vaxxed are perfectly healthy.
0	Thank you for your work Dr. Cambell, it is so very important! As a Dane, almost everyone I know who chose to get the jab got very ill for a week or two, and none of them reported it. Danes don't complain much, so expect these numbers to be grossly underst
0	Booster shot just been found out to give a 1 in 35 chance of myrocardial heart damage.... PROVED by thoee NOT PROFITING from the research.
1	If anyone ever calls ivermectin a horse drug or animal drug of any kind, you then know that you can immediately discount their opinion, because they have no idea what they're talking about
1	Getting vaccinated allowed me to finally reunite with family members I hadn't seen in months
0	Only those bralnwashed into thinking the system was infallible fell for it
0	idk if the covid19 virus is as bad as everyone is fearmongoring it out to be but im scared to death. im a fucking health nut if i get a cold im paranoid let alone a viral disease that is killing thousands of people that isnt preventable by vaccine and isnt curable.
0	When the truth about the jabs becomes accepted fact, there will be government people and others charged with crimes against humamity.
1	it's amazing how utterly convinced you're not wrong in believing completely disproven facts  i really hope you don't have some sort of awakening and suddenly realize how you were wrong all this time because i think the embarrassment might just cause your brain to kill itself
0	I'm on the fence. Waiting for more vaccine info.
0	In 2016 and 2017 I was vaccinated for the flu and got horribly sick. There is no way, not even if hell froze over I am participating in the current vaccine obligation because even though I'm a healthcare worker, my patient rights still stand and I have my immune system to fight off viruses.
1	Please just let this end. I miss my friends and family so bad :( Life has started to just return to normal here in rural IL but people are dying more and more... I can’t in good thoughts to out and be apart of this
0	Why are they pushing vaccines when the diseases are so rare?
0	Forced to take the flu shot by my mom my whole lifeâ€¦ always got the flu twice. Stopped getting the flu shot and havenâ€™t been sick for 5 years. My mom was forced to get the Covid vaccine against her choice in order to keep her job (sheâ€™s about to retire). She got Covid weeks later. I have not gotten it because she tells me not to and I havenâ€™t gotten Covid. ðŸ¤·ðŸ»â€â™€ï¸ Who knows what the right answer is. It doesnâ€™t seem that anyone has one. And yet the people responsible for covid are free. Iâ€™m neither republican nor democrat. Go figureâ€¦
0	I had so many family members try to tell me that I was reason that COVID persisted because of not getting vaccinated. They are not saying that now.
1	Covid was the no. 3 cause of mortality in 2021 in red states and red counties, after heart disease and cancer. The redder the state, the stupider and higher the mortality rate. Oklahoma, Texas, West Virginia and Wyoming lead the nation in stupid and unwashed people who died of covid that year.
1	Friendly reminder that if you're nervous about mRNA vaccines there's a good COVID vaccine for you--NovaVax! It's highly effective and has extremely low rates of side effects!
1	It hurts to see people blind
0	The fact that they’re trying THIS hard to convince people to get that shot should scare the hell out of all of you.
1	How long does the vaccine last?  I already had COVID 19, so why would I need a vaccine?  If the vaccine lasts a long time, immunity from having the disease should last a long time.
1	It's not just about trusting the government, it's the media as well. If news outlets would report the news, instead of giving us their take on it, that would greatly help.
1	why do these people not realize their experience is not everyone else's??? Just bc you don't think covid is bad doesn't mean you should put others at risk
0	The Covid-19 vaccine rollout has been the worst medical disaster in human history.
1	I had a crazy bad reaction to the MMR vaccine when I was a toddler. I still get all my vaccines. It's insane to me that people feel like it's some huge risk. It seems selfish to me
0	So good to know im not the only one against all this bullshit
1	I got my first shot today! I have anxiety about shots and one woman in the group had to stare at the floor because seeing someone getting a shot makes her feel nausea. Applause to us and every other person that had to really push through some mental barriers to get vaccinated and bravely did anyway
1	Well said. We need the whole world to be vaccinated.
0	We will not know the damage they have done to these children for 20 to 40 years. Those will be very sad and angry times.
1	I am so happy to announce that my grandparents just survived corona, thankfully they had already gotten their vaccinations, so they were some what prepared. God bless everyone's loved ones.
0	I'm not taking no vaccine. I don't even take flu shots. Do not shame people who do not want to take assholes
1	Everyone should be vaccinated, even those who think they are smarter than smart people.
0	ALL SHEEP repeat after me. Safe and effective! Safe and effective! Safe and effective! 20th booster now available, hurry get in line!
1	Got the #PfizerBioNTech vaccine !!
0	No to forced or coerced injections.
0	Indeed. Our natural resources have got the West plotting against us. But, Lo and Behold, we are fighting this virus tooth and nail. We still have the LOWEST infections and death rate of #covid19, to the dismay of #BillGates and co. We don't need his vaccines after all. 💅🏽
0	You mean the thing that doesn't kill you or at the very least, hospitalize you? No thanks.
1	No hesitation – fully vaccinated and proud! My son and his wife had COVID, but we prioritized safety. Vaccination is a collective effort for community well-being.
1	Main difference: Flu CFR (Case Fatality Rate): 0.1%. COVID-19: Possibly 4% (currently 3.63% in China, which is the largest dataset there is). On average 25 Million are infected every season with Flu. Without a vaccine or treatment, that would potentially mean 1 Million dead.
0	The only question I'd ask the reporter and anyone else: "How can you be suuuure, the vaccine is safe?"
1	This is gaslighting. Trying to tell her that her friend’s injury was random and there was no causal relationship to the kool-aide, gaslighting.
1	This was fascinating and highly informative!
1	Lab studies suggest #Pfizer, #Moderna vaccines can protect against #coronavirusvariant
0	My unvaccinated 80 yr old parents just had covid.  They are fine.
0	People are suffering from post covid19 because of the vaccine they have been injected with. It looks like they are getting desperate for you to continue with their boosters, so as to achieve their depopulation plan. Those that are unvaxxed, stay that way and live.
0	It’s just a coincidence that this happened to thousands of people right after getting jabbed….it’s just a coincidence!!!!
0	I won't be a guinea pig for a poorly tested vaccine.
0	Crimes against humanity!!!! All must be held accountable
1	Smart people get vaccinated.
1	If you heard of someone getting cancer from the COVID vaccine you heard lies. Most forms of cancer cannot develop in just a couple years.  Only a handful of people around the world have died from the COVID vaccine.  The heart problems are the most common issue with the vaccine. He's more likely to get that heart problem from COVID than from the vaccine.  Get Moderna
0	Do NOT TAKE THE COVID VACCINE. IT IS BAD FOR YOU
1	The side effects were minimal compared to the risk of getting COVID-19.
1	Incompetent leadership = limp response to pandemic threat&; dismantling health protection programs &; lack of respect for scientists. Stop electing ppl who believe crazy conspiracy theories and who have no idea what the flu death rate is or how a vaccine works. #COVID19
1	I'm vaccinated and still wait to die from it and my chip activated. I'm pretty disappointed.
0	I know multiple people from age 19-46 who have died from strokes, aneurysms, heart attacks, and fast growing cancers. All of them with no previous health issues. My 26 year old physical therapist said three people in her PT classes at Pitt now have brain and blood cancers. Weird right?
1	Im so overwhelmed because if not this vaccine i would have lost my sister to covid! i want people to understand that this vaccine doesnt prevent covid , it just reduces the severity
1	Hell yeah get vaxxed y'all
0	We know what happened, we know what scientists and government covered up. NEVER again will I trust advice from scientists
1	that part of the reason vaccines exist, to get herd immunity
0	So glad I stood strong and never got one of those jabs.
1	Vaccination is a civic duty. Let's work together to achieve herd immunity.
0	Shame on everyone who coerced or pressured people to take that shot.
1	I feel awesome – just for the opportunity to maybe help others feel confident to do the same, because that’s how we get past this and move on.
1	Grateful for the scientists pushing boundaries to protect us all.
1	Long term effects of covid suck, please get the vaccine.
0	This aged like fine milk. Look at today, did the vaccine REaALLY work out or is it just me living under a rock?
1	The possibilities of serious illness or death are virtually eliminated for those of us with the sense to get vaccinated.
0	Doesnt sound fake at all!!
0	When hell freezes over ill get a shot
1	Reports of a fever, headache chills etc. after the first dose are the most common as your body might have an immune response to the lipid nanoparticles used to transport the mRNA through the bloodstream. This is not the case for everybody though. Some reports of Bell’s palsy, but the rate is consistent with the expected background rate in the population, so no correlation can be made to the vaccine. Same goes for 6 people in the trials who died, most were cardiac issues and only 2 were actually given the vaccine. Again consistent with background rates. Other than that, not much else I know about personally. If I were you I’d try and stay vigilant and rational about this stuff, because news outlets are going to jump at the chance to get tons of clicks by saying “look side effects!!”. I’d be very surprised if suddenly a large number of people developed side effects from the vaccine seeing as there has been no evidence during the trials of anything they might have missed.
1	Give me my vaccy and my stimy so I can yeet some Tesla calls and proceed to party on my newly purchased yacht
0	As a fellow physician, I very much appreciate the way you explain this in a simple way. One other point to make is that the vaccine simply was NOT intended to prevent infection, but rather the studies showed that it increased survival! As someone who is vaccinated, when my (vaccinated) son brought home and shared COVID with us a few weeks back, we all did well, and basically had only cold symptoms.  Much better than when we were trach and PEGing people in the ICU every day.
1	I have autism and it feels almost offensive when people say disease safety causes autism. It's stupid.
0	I think the vaccination is not the way to end the disease. Whats’ important is that we need to develop medicines that can lead people to survive from this disease easily. The flu vaccinations are not%100 protective and they’re never gonna be. Everybody gets caught a flu and gets well with a medicine. That’s the only solution that we should focus.
0	Just don't force me to take them and I am happy.
0	I'm unvaccinate I really proud! actually now thank you Lord
0	Career bureaucrats and Party apparatchiks are forcing tiny children to cover their faces and submit to covid vaccination. Instead of protecting the integrity of medicine, doctors are legitimizing these barbaric practices. The medical profession has revealed itself as the enemy.
0	By not taking the jab, I'm 100% safe from side effects and 99% safe from covid.
0	Lies...it is poison
0	The lack of long-term data on COVID-19 vaccines makes me uncomfortable. It feels like we're part of a global experiment without definitive knowledge of future consequences.
1	She didn’t die. So what are you saying. If she wasn’t vaccinated she probably would be DEAD!
1	I am ready for the vaccine. The owner at my work just told us he will give us a paid week off once we all get vaccinated, I love that he is convincing people by way of incentive
0	Covid Vaccine Injury In The Philippines: Young ‘Angelo’ Can No Longer Walk Or Talk Very sad footage from the vaccine rollout in the Philippines.
0	this will be very interesting to watch, especially now that more and more studies are coming out showing how bad the vaccine actually was.
0	The only thing you need to know- DON’T TAKE IT!
1	A lot of Latin american countries do this. We take vaccines really seriously here. People here make long queues in order to get vaccines.
1	The COVID-19 vaccine is our best shot at returning to normalcy.
1	people who are vaccinated are mostly safe from COVID, yes. But they’re still not affecting only themselves! Why? Well, there’s people who can’t get vaccinated (allergies,issues with immune system etc). Also, there’s a lot of ER rooms completely full of unvaccinated people, because of this other people with urgent issues have to wait which could end badly, a while ago I heard about someone’s child who had appendicitis so they went to the ER. They had to wait 2 hours because the place was packed with covid patients, the kid’s appendix ended up bursting and they had to stay in the hospital for five days.
0	New Zealand took on multigenerational debt overreacting to covid and I got fired over a vaccine mandate in Dec 2021 I still haven't gotten a new job yet fml :(
1	My dad is high risk and got the first of two covid shots, he's getting his second one today and he has felt completely fine.
0	Vaccines cause more harm than good. Just look at the data!
0	Anti-vaxxers are the kind of people that throw kids off bridges because the bridge might fall.
1	My dad just passed away this morning from covid. I hope this message is a wake up call for someone out there. Please don't put your family through this.
0	People forcing these injections on others are going to have to pay .
0	As a nurse I may lose my job for this, but this is a gigantic NO for me.  COVID is rarely a fatal illness now, and our immune systems can fight it if we let them.  Just say no to vaccines for corporate profit.
0	t took my sister's life. Before she took her vaccinations, she was very healthy! Very sad to say. She always told us to stay home and save lives. She even followed all the Covid protection rules. She would wipe off all the items and groceries when she brings it home. And she wanted to protect her self and others as well. But this is how she left from us.
0	Just not interested in being a 1st time guinea pig.
0	My body my choice, right liberals?
0	i wont take the vac , and wont take a guilt trip for not doing so thankyou
0	I'm unvaccinated, because I'm not stupid…
0	My mother died 20 days after her vaccination - 24 hours after vax - she got thrombocytopenia and died a horrific death. Never will forgive for what happened.
1	Id love to see a graph that plots out anti vaxers and alcoholics. I bet you'd find a pattern.
0	My mother died of a stroke after her second vaccine. She’d never had a stroke before.
1	I'm 27. Just got my second dose yesterday, don't feel great but it's livable. Please get it. We want this pandemic to end so we can work on the next crisis.
1	I remember getting a smallpox vaccination many years ago. I remember people lining up to get them.  I can understand people who are allergic to eggs being careful of what kind of vaccinations they get. But I dont even know if eggs ate used in the production of modern vaccines. So it might not be something to worry about any more. But I do know I dont want the illnesses that vaccines prevent.
0	No stop pushing vaxines. If someone has health conditions that make them especially vulnerable to serious illness or death then they can choose to be vaccinated to reduce chance of hospitalisation to they then have their armer on, but if someone with no other health issue and low chances of hospitalisation, then they may chose to rely on their own immune system. Both vaccinated and UN vaccinated can get covid and can pass it on. The benefit of the Vax is personal protection if u have a high chance of serious illness . Vacinating children is un necessary as they tend to cope well with the virus, and teachers should make their own choices
0	We didn’t buy any of it. Never took the shot and I regret even testing for covid. (Shocker I’m unvaccinated and never tested positive ever!)
0	I am remaining unvaxxed. At all cost that is important.
1	Sure, believe bs, but I haven’t had any vaccines affect me or anyone I know badly.
0	The vaccinations don’t stop you from getting it. They stop it from being as painful and deadly as it could be.  Personally, I developed horrible untreatable Tinnitus after the 2nd booster. I won’t get any more vaccinations
0	It is illegal to injection an unknown substance into humans. If adjuvant not revealed violation of informed consent. Disgusting.
1	Lmao dumb anti vaxxers
0	I don't trust WHO show me one person who's healthy after taking vaccines
0	I am glad I watched this because it helped me realise that the shots are certainly unsafe.
1	I got the Moderna shot yesterday. Arm's sore and I have the chills and my body aches, but I'm sure it's better than what COVID would feel like.
0	It's rare to die from covid-19, I'll skip the shot.
0	In your dreams. Never in 1000 years would I let a six month old child get vaccinated.
1	It was never amusing. Earlier it was “only” kids dying of the measles because their dumbass parents were antivaxxers. With COVID-19, it started affecting adults so that’s why they get more attention. The public seems to be better able to tolerate children dying of preventable shit than adults.
1	I had my vaccinations as a kid and im still here because of them i dintnunderstand why people are acting like this is such a new thing theres vaccines that save lives
0	Increased sweating
0	THANK GOD I DID NOT GET THE VACCINE
1	Vaccination meant I could finally hug my grandparents again after months of being apart.
1	You know the nation is fed up with unvaccinated people when the WHITE HOUSE is calling them out
1	we’re in this mess because too many people didn’t get vaccinated.
1	It has to get uncomfortable before one sees like light!  Save yourself and others around you and get vaccinated.  Please!
1	Omg congratulations! Every time I see someone getting the vaccine I get happy
1	He was talking about how getting vaccinated will protect those around you and how states with low vaccination rates will might start to see the virus come back. I don't think it was a threat, I think he was literally saying that not getting a vaccinated was directly costly on its own.
0	Good things don’t come fast. There is a reason why vaccines need years or even decade to complete test and declared safe to be used. By using keywords like ‘vaccine need to be prioritise’ etc just merely tapping on Singaporean’s one unqiue trait ‘kiasu’ to lead them rush into vaccination without studying the knowledge on vaccines. Remember only you yourself will care for your health. Do studies and judge for yourself before deciding.
1	right now one of the best things you could do to support the NHS is to get vaccinated against #COVID19
0	I just had to come back to this now that we know the "vaccine hesitant" people were 100% right.
1	Every person should take the vaccine as early as possible.
0	had received both doses of the Pfizer vaccine. I do not plan to get anymore vaccines. I experience sone chest discomfort/fatigue/sore arm days and days on after receiving the second dose.
1	I’m 16 with asthma and I’m glad i got the vaccine!
1	Glad we will be able to get rid of this vris finally.
1	I remember hearing this story of this mum who wouldn't let her child get vaccinated, so the child (12 years old) took it upon himself to get the vaccine without his mum knowing! VERY SMART KID! AND TRUE STORY
1	I'm from canada where mercifully we've been able to get access to the vaccine more quickly, but it was still infuriating having to explain to guys from the states that it took until august to get my second shot due to how the states was hording it to the point where it was going to waste.
1	Vaccination is the key to unlocking a world without Covid-19. Let's turn the key
0	Most of my family and friends have gotten the jab and their health has deteraited so sad yes I've lost friends over this
1	Nothing you’ve said so far is even remotely true. But I don’t feel like arguing with a brick wall so you’re not worth the energy for a proper rebuttal. Everyone else is doing it for me, anyway. But I will say this-  My mom herniated three disks in her neck from whooping cough. She’s immune compromised and caught it off a friend’s unvaccinated kid. So fuck you, and keep you and your plague rat friends away from my family.
0	You mean the „long vaccine”. 😉
1	No fear, just facts – vaccines are the way to go
0	Why would anyone trust the government ?. No vaccines
0	As a Norwegian im gonna nominate you for a Nobel price. You made me not take the vaccine and it probably saved my life. High levels of vitamin D is the best defence. Thank you sir
0	Oh great another scam jab
1	Same here I felt better than after my covid-19 vaccination . I got the booster and flu same day. The dose of the booster is smaller than the first two so lot less side effects. It had been 8 months since my second dose .
0	My blood type is (O-) I don't smoke, I don't drink alcohol, I don't take drugs, I live in the Atlas Mountains in Algeria, every day I drink olive oil for lunch and dinner, I didn't get sick with corona and I didn't get vaccinated, and I'm happy with my choice
0	Smart girl for declining. The gaslighting around the C19 jabs is OFF THE CHARTS!!!
1	Vaccines are a key tool in the fight against antibiotic resistance.
0	Can't fail the safety checks when you get to skip them
1	#India gets 3rd #COVID19 vaccine as DCGI today approved #SputnikV vaccine for emergency use, making it the third COVID-19 vaccine to be registered in India.
0	I’ve read the annotation to Fizer vaccine. Its not recommended for people younger than 16.
1	Thank you for making this video. I am participating in a current vaccine clinical trial, and I cannot stress enough how the medical staff involved is taking every measure to make sure that it is both safe and effective. Continuous testing and monitoring are happening at all stages.
1	"I don't want to poison my body" Gets McDonald's on the way home and gets drunk on the weekend, maybe a few cigarettes too
1	Hold on America. We have 2 #vaccines to help us crush this virus. BUT we have to do our part. Make wise decisions.
0	So relieved that I didn’t crumble, I remained strong and do not have that poison in my body !!
0	It’s so safe they need to promote it 24/7
1	Epidemiologist call it "Herd Immunity" and Health Economist will say it is "Positive Externality"...But both are saying vaccination works.
0	it's a bit late I'm Vaccine INJURED already
0	As a nurse, I witnessed my coworkers have significant adverse effects and then be met with stone silence by the medical establishment.  That was enough to make me not want to take it.
0	My second AZ here in Australia put me in a hospital ED. I live in a small rural hamlet of 13 homes . In our hamlet: one ED emergency, one capillary leak event and swollen hands still on-going over a year later, one on-going erratic heart racing and breathlessness, needed cardiologist services from a private hospital, and 3 cases of BP spikes and 4 tinnitus onset. Last 2 were overlaps in the same people. What a massive lie. Do the WHO think we are morons?? I will never support anything the WHO instigate. I will never approve of our government over-reach, trust our medical institutions again nor be taking note of their BS guidelines. None here lined up for any boosters.Why? in a small community people actually talk to each other and know what is happening. If the YT censors want to call fake, every one of us is happy to enter into direct court sworn statutory declarations communication with the medical records to prove these adverse events. Because private hospitals and private specialists , not our public institutions, were involved all recorded as adverse vaccine reactions. Fake? No! Truth on the ground. BTW, hamlet population: 43 adults and 3 children.3 adults, one child no vaccination so do the numbers.
0	Safe and effective? This is a clown show.
1	Certainly. We cannot afford to risk and sacrifice the lives of our students. Plus, it's too much agony for our health workers to be risking their lives. Teachers need to be heard too. Specially that in the Public school, handling 60 students in a class with 5 to 6 teaching loads in a day is really risky.
1	I have heard of people getting sick or dying from COVID, never heard of this happening from vaccines. Common sense seems to be lacking among anti-vaxxers unfortunately.
1	I got vaccinated not just for myself, but for my elderly parents who are at higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19
1	Still fine here after being double vaxxed with Pfizer and a survivor of covid in 2020
0	We need to change their words like they do to us. Instead of long covid just start replying with long pfizer or long covid vax.
1	First one done. Got my sticker for being brave  #vaccinated #jabbed
0	It's the excess deaths in children that makes it even more shocking the corrupt parliament age ignoring it.
0	After vaccine my health got downhill and developed high Bp and heart issues and I'm still young
1	Choosing to get vaccinated is an act of kindness and responsibility. Let's encourage one another to take this positive step towards protecting ourselves and our communities.
1	I think the vaccines are great but most importantly the Moderna vaccines opens up a new world for targeted therapeutics. It is interesting that antibody testing isn't being done beforehand just because we could prioritize vaccines for people who don't already have antibodies. Some people may have been asymptomatic and developed antibodies against SARS-Cov-2. My family all got Moderna and they were so happy to get it both doses.
0	The only thing you need to know about vaccine- DON’T TAKE IT!
1	my thoughts before the video: pfizer and moderna are the best my thoughts after the video: pfizer and moderna are still the best
0	Who else got fired cause refused to get a covid-19 vaccine?
1	I love the "unproven untested" claim. It's literally been in the works for years.
0	the first covid vaccine I got gave me heart palpitations, no thanks.
0	I am unvaccinated and don't have any regrets.
1	As a doctor i feel so sad when people spread wrong information
1	Let's roll up our sleeves – not just for the shot but for the chance to hug our loved ones safely again.
1	Finally, I get to say this, Got #Jabbed  You should too,, go and get it done :)) It's all starts by completing your responsibility to save the world by getting vaccinated?!! #vaccinated
1	the problem with vaccines is that they kept me alive enough to see anti vaxxers
1	9 percent of people in hospitals and intensive care are unvaccinated. The vaccinated are at far less risk. Also fact.
0	I wouldn't take the vax for a million free hamburgers+fries OR donuts.
1	I love how the flu vaccine was standard here.
0	Under normal circumstances, these “vaccines” should have been pulled from the market.
0	I'd rather take my chances with the measles than risk vaccine side effects.
1	I’m not an anti-vaxxer or whatever you call it, but I just don’t know enough about this one, it’s so new and makes my anxiety sky rocket
0	"I am a healthcare worker and I work in a public hospital. I refused to get vaccinated. The pressure I was subjected to was brutal. But I resisted tooth and nail because I never believed what they were telling us. In the end, I won. I never stopped working and have an excellent health."
1	Hope my parents feel dumb for thinking the vaccine will make you magnetic lol
0	are these vaccines good for all variants ? if no, i think this situation going to lead to a major mess
0	I’ve never met anyone who didn’t get the vaccine and has regrets. Now people I know who are vaccinated is a different story, including myself.
0	I work with someone who now has an incurable heart condition who used to be perfectly healthy. What changed to that person? The vaccine, just like is explained in this video!
0	Totally! My sister had a heart attack after that thing, lets hope the red head gets to know how it feels like
1	Got my first Covid shot. No symptoms except a slightly sore arm. The two Shingles shots I got last year HURT my arm.
0	yeah, I wouldn’t take it if I were you, I know someone who died from it
1	Today, Jennifer Haller, a healthy mother of two, became the first person in history to test a potential vaccine for COVID-19. We owe her and 44 other people stepping up for human trials a debt of gratitude Â– may their bravery save many lives.
0	My friend died the day after she had the  vaccine and there was nothing wrong before
1	I like vaccines, they keep us and our children (mostly) healthy and immunized
1	I had RSV last year and it suuucked. I had a cough so bad it kept me from sleeping properly for a month. Couldn't go more than a few seconds without coughing up a lung. Super painful. Definitely getting the vaccine.
0	Remember it was sold to us here in the UK as "Safe and effective " .. got alot of grief at work for not taking it. Proud to be an Anti Vaxer! So sorry for all the people who felt they had no choice.
1	Hi! I was trying not to be overly excited about my vaccine when it was very hard to access in the U.S. But now is the time for me to hit you with my enthusiasm. It feels so GREAT to be protected! It's fun, and it leads to more fun, and you should get this for yourself.
1	got the pfizer shot, no booster, never tested positive for covid. Haven't gotten any side effects but I feel like I should be worried about my future. Nothing I can do about it now
0	Cost of the vaccines are too high
0	I hear so many people die from the vaccine
0	What about the part that it causes myocarditis
1	Maybe be thankful you are keeping yourself and loved ones safe and healthy
1	Vaccination not only safeguards individuals but also contributes to community immunity, protecting those who cannot be vaccinated
1	Done! Vaccine #1 is done. Phew.
1	Any word on a booster for this variant?
0	I'm worried about the potential for severe allergic reactions to the COVID-19 vaccine. While rare, these reactions are serious and add to my apprehension about getting vaccinated.
1	In my country(Nigeria), no one is being forced to take the vaccine but it's available if you want to. There has been no issue concerning taking the vaccine so far over here. People were apprehensive at first but the response has been far better since we're not being forced to take it.
0	Your not a whistle blower, your a human being with love and compassion for humanity. Thank you for your bravery and for the sacrifices you have made to bring awareness to what’s really going on the world. We need more people like you and I hope others see this and are encouraged to do the same because our lives and future generations depend on it.
1	Fully vaccinated and boosted I’m 65 years old and I’ve had no side effects unless you call never having Covid one
1	I feel like all the stories with yalls Covid test results and vaccination/booster status contributes to Covid fatigue buuut maybe that’s just me
0	I'm unvaxxed and got it at 7 months pregnant. Was sickish for 3 days then perfectly fine. Everyone who was vaxxed that I know  got way sicker than I did. Very strange. Almost like they are supposed to make you sicker.
0	I'm protected, I have antivirus on my phone
0	I refuse this poison!
0	If you took the covid vax... good luck on life insurance.
0	Seattle bartender attacked with sharpened broomstick after asking for COVID-19 vaccination card A Trump supporter no doubt, not vaccinated with a do not give a damn violent attitude.
0	didn’t even take the flu shot so imma respectfully decline covid vaccine shot. If you feel like you need it then do what you gotta do. I’m not saying don’t get. I’m just saying I’m healthy and feel I don’t need it.
0	THANK GOD I DID NOT GET THE VACCINE
0	Are we the Minority anticovid vaccine? Out of 100people how many have not taken the shoot? What is the bigger scheme behind all this? What will the future look like for us, our kids and our grandkids. Why is this happening?
1	Thank goodness Sony didn't make the vaccine...there would be only 400 doses or so available.
0	Imagine a vaccine so safe you have to be THREATENED to take it..... For a Disease SO DEADLY you have to Tested to know you have it
0	I regret every vaccine I gave my children.
0	I’m in my late 60s and ever since I’ve took the vaccine. I took two shots for Moderno. I’ve had high blood pressure never had it before that.
1	Seriously. I cried over breakfast telling my child they can get vaccinated soon. The relief will be unimaginable.
0	vaccine manufacturers are exempt from liability – they have no incentive to make them safe?
0	m glad I'm not getting anymore vaccine. I made that mistake last year because I'm was scared and paranoid when my pops died from COVID. Nobody in my home is never getting vaccinated again. We didn't get the flu shot last fall or the COVID shot and we not this year.
1	I cant fucking believe that Im seeing this. Barely 9 months ago I was in a hazmat suit and nobody was sure what we're dealing with here. Here we are handing out fucking vaccines left right and center. I FUCKING LOVE MODERN MEDICINE.
0	I warned people they didn’t listen so now they’re all scared. DEATH IS COMING FOR THE JABBED
0	Sunak can say the vaccines are safe, then when proven wrong he'll say he was told they were safe by medical experts. In other words, he'll take no responsibility.
1	I work in healthcare. Am around covid constantly. Fully vaxxed and boosted, haven't got it yet.
0	Dear vaccinated; long Covid is not real. It’s the vaccines.
1	Knowing that I am due for a short hospital stay in early January, it would be AMAZING if those healthcare workers were able to start getting vaccinated in December. It would make me feel safer, and it would make me less stressed about possibly getting them sick myself. I probably won't get access to a vaccine before the summer, but I eagerly await that day as well!
1	The vaccine is our ticket to hugging our friends and family again. I've never felt more grateful for science and health workers.
1	I got the first dose of the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine! I am so happy that the key to ending the pandemic has arrived.
0	Covid has become some kind of weird fetish for these imbeciles. I almost think they want to get infected so they can carry on and on about whose fault it was.
1	Thankful for the vaccine and the hope it brings for a safer future
1	I feel sorry for some people who can't take the vaccine. They will always be at risk to Covid. However teachers are not just responsible for self but are responsible for the children they are looking after. So yes it should be mandatory
1	Opposing thee vaccine is turning a blind eye to one of medicine's most powerful tools.
1	It doesn't entirely stop the spread of delta. It does greatly reduce the time someone is contagious after catching it, which in turn greatly reduces the number of people said person will infect. It does greatly reduce the odds of someone who is contagious from spreading it while they are contagious.  It does greatly reduce the odds of someone who has caught it from becoming severely ill. It does greatly reduce the odds of someone who has caught it from being hospitalized. It does greatly reduce the odds of someone who has caught it from going into the ICU. It does greatly reduce the odds of someone who has caught it from being intubated. It does greatly reduce the odds of someone who has caught it from dying.  It does greatly reduce the strain on our medical system. It does greatly reduce the pain and suffering of people's families. It does greatly reduce the economic impact of the virus on the economy. the vaccine does not stop the spread of delta.
1	Wasn't a hard choice. Public health comes first.
0	In the last two months alone 5 males I know including my dad have suddenly been diagnosed with thick blood and irregular heartbeat, my friends fiance has had a stroke, all have had the jab ?
1	I'm a parent, and I want to protect my children from COVID-19. That's why I made sure they got vaccinated as soon as possible. I feel so much better knowing that they're protected.
1	As someone who had covid last year and just got vaccinated, trust me, the vaccine side effects are WAY less painful than actually having it.
1	As much as I loathe the ignorance, I’m still someone with enough love for my fellow humans to not want to see them die. RIP Chris. Let go of the regret, it’s too late now. Also, praying for my brother right now. My whole family has Covid. He is the only one not vaxxed and in hospital. The rest of us are feeling better on day 2 and 3 at home thankfully! God bless us all!
1	Education is the key for these vaccines.
1	My little guy got first dose of both the flu and Covid vaccine on the same day
1	Got my jab and feeling a sense of relief. Let's crush this virus together.
1	Your last statement is extremely important. Supporting basic research is so important.
1	YES THANK YOU FOR NOT BEING ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE LIKE “THEY PUT TRACKERS IN THEM AND IT WILL KILL US, MAKE US PARALYZED ECT..
0	I am unvaccinated and don't have any regrets.
1	I’m on my 9th shot...can’t wait for #10!!! Pfizer said it will be good for me 🙂
0	Why do I feel like they lied about everything?
1	My second vaccine dose is getting moved up with the increased supply in Canada! Time to celebrate (s)hot girl summer!
0	Doctor: I'm going to give you a vaccination. Patient: Any possibly harmful side effects? Doctor: That's up to you to find out.
1	And vaccination plus acquired immunity gives more protection from reinfection.
0	There is an increase of heart attacks strokes and cancers my goodness l never hear of so many in the last 2 years.
1	thanks for sharing, just gor my first shot so helps to see this and prepare
1	the mental gymnastics of the anti-vaxxers here are amazing
0	Toxic clot shots with NO clinical safety data or long term efficacy….
0	Not vaccinated, never had covid, most of my family have been vaccinated, all had covid.
1	I’m the only one in my office who got the latest booster. I’m also the only one in my office who has not had Covid even after being exposed to it. Get your booster, y'all
1	I haven't been vaccinated and have not been sick. I wear N95 masks. I don't understand all the fuss about wearing masks. They've worked for me.
1	Teacher, vaccinate staff and students, prevent spread in schools.
0	I regret TAKING IT. Worst mistake of my life!
0	Weakness
0	As a nurse, I witnessed my coworkers have significant adverse effects and then be met with stone silence by the medical establishment. That was enough to make me not want to take it.
1	i have asthma, and i’m really concerned that if i got the virus before being vaccinated, i would get seriously hurt. i was of the first people in line as soon as i could get it, because as much as i hate myself, i would prefer not to die like that.
0	the VACCINE IS NOT 100% SAFE!!
0	Are you guys insane? It is happening to millions of people all over the world!! WAKE UP
1	I was hesitant at first, but learning how vaccines undergo rigorous testing and continuous monitoring changed my perspective. Now, I view getting vaccinated as a proactive step towards protecting my health.
1	There is always SOMEONE who wants to earn quick fame through conspiracies and misleading information that risks the public health...
0	The vaccine is an open doorway to demonic possession. We now know the spike protein is actually a snake venom peptide. What happens when you change your DNA to essentially part snake? You are a nephilim and demons have access. Old woman could see demons and smell (sulfur).
0	I don't gamble with my money, and definitely not with my heath. You can have all my boosters you fascists
0	My best friend is my immune system
1	Honestly, saying you won't get the vaccine because it's rushed is like saying you won't use a new phone because it's too fast.
1	I took the vaccine because I know some grad students or scientists worked hard af in a lab and like I didn't want all that work to go to waste and so they know it was worth it. Like STEM students have it hard enough, or maybe they're just good at complaining about homework but as a humanities person, I just wanted to let them know they did good work
1	#COVID19 vaccine is a critical tool in the fight against the pandemic, offering protection to individuals, communities, & the global population while contributing to the broader goals of public health, economic recovery, and a return to normalcy.
1	with my first dose, I only had arm soreness! I got my second shot of Pfizer yesterday and had a low-grade fever, chills, headache, and muscle ache for 12-24 hours after the shot! But nothing some ibuprofen/tylenol can't fix!
1	For now, protective immunity is the equivalent of wearing a seat belt. It keeps you safe.
0	Smart girl for declining. The gaslighting around the C19 jabs is OFF THE CHARTS!!!
0	If a person or government is forcing you to do or take something, you don't have to do any research or prove anything, just refuse it by default, because they want to hurt you.
1	The first dose won't effect you because your body is now training to accept the protein from the COVID spikes, the second dose is when your immune system boosts in that's why you might a fever, body ache, and other symptoms. Because your body is really fighting and trying to used to the COVID so once you get it your body is ready to battle it again. Also vaccines are NOT 100% effective you can still catch COVID but you won't experience major symptoms. It's definitely different for everyone but it definitely lowers your chance of dying with COVID.  Also remember to wear a mask even if your vaccinated i know the CDC didn't say that but you can still spread COVID to people who are younger or have not been vaccinated. P.S. Sorry if there is grammar mistakes or spelling. Stay Safe! :)
0	Sooner or later all those who promote this drug (including YouTube bosses) will be arrested and charged with grievous bodily harm.
1	Do they not realize the vaccine will make symptoms less severe? I’ve had it twice while vaccinated and didn’t even feel sick and it was very mild. The people who don’t get vaccinated can get a lot sicker and they are the ones who end up hospitalized and dying
0	I don't want the vaccine, I don't need the vaccine, you can shove it all the way up your ass and enjoy yourself while you mind your own business.
0	If you take the vax you are a fuckin slave to the system. Might as well pledge your alliance to your owners ️
1	We are essentially giving our cells a manual, with a sticky note saying "be better"
1	Vaccines: the silent guardians of public health.
0	Why did they require people to sign a waiver if the vaccines are safe?
0	If you have to get a "booster" every six months, it's not a vaccine.
1	Yay! I’m so happy we have a vaccine now. I wish you godspeed and strength for delivering them!
1	It's a scary thing for me to know that even a pediatrician can be an anti-vax person.....
1	My husband and I are fully vaccinated and our 16 year old will receive her 2nd dose soon. We are patiently waiting for something to be approved for our 11 year old son. Vaccines rock!
0	Good luck trying to get help or have anything proved if you have any issues arising from the jab, thats all i can say 👍
0	Yes, it's a bioweapon produced in Wuhan, paid by US-taxpayers. Unbelievable but true!
0	You need to check out the newly released information of the side effects is interesting especially considering all the people that have died.
0	I am remaining unvaxxed. At all cost that is important.
0	You do not build immunity to Covid. Vax actually destroys the immune system, sort of like HIV. Prevention is the only way to stay safe.
1	Just got my shot! 2nd dose of #COVID19 Vaccine done! Gracias! 💉❤️🙏🙏
0	You utterly clueless cockwomble. The excess deaths started AFTER the rollout. They continue even though covid mutated to sniffles. Also the deaths are vaccine, NOT covid, because on examinations it's the presence of spike damage, without the nucleocapsid from the whole virus.
0	There is no such thing as a safe and effective vaccine
0	Avoid Long Covid - don’t get jabbed
0	NOT GETTING VACINATED IS WISDOM!
0	Imagine a product so awful that you have to lobby for tyrannical laws just so ppl will buy it.
1	This is what I tell all the people who are anti-vaxers and I lost both my aunt and cousin to covid...and they were nurses treating people with covid during the outbreak last year.
1	To the skeptics: vaccines have been saving lives for years. COVID vaccine is just the latest example
0	As a parent i disagree with hoda.we arent putting that garbage in our kids
1	From my personal experience,I got mor resistance after getting vaccinated….
1	I’ve had the vaccine and all the boosters. Just got the new booster today.
0	Side effects like crazy. Almost felt worse than when I actually had corona. How is that?
1	Just imagine being the pro-vaccine doctor who probably has 15+ years of studying, looking at countless studies, and practicing medicine only for a wine mom with zero understanding of medicine to tell you "you're wrong."
1	Its better then having covid so im getting it
0	"some" 75 athletes in Germany all had heart attacks after the jab but it's not the jab. Just coincidence.
1	Get vaccinated please!!
0	Thank GOD I didn’t get jabbed. Feel terrible for all the trusting individuals who thought they were doing the responsible thing. So sad
0	Vaccines are not the only solution
0	We know now just how smart some of us were not to have that trial jab!!
0	Could not agree more. No chance will I take this non preventative substance. Not a chance!
0	They are NOT safe! STOP LYING!
0	I want natural cures and remedies! I don't trust these expedited and 'unproven' medications.
0	I'd rather trust my immune system than a rushed vaccine.
0	Even if it was only one person death from the jab, health authorities should have stopped giving to people immediately. I find it so so so so hard to believe that they are threatening people to go and get it, I can’t believe this is happening.
1	No it's one of the conspiracies coming from the Russian troll farms.
0	Kudos to all the uninjected!
1	Yeah vaccination would give someone who has had a prior infection a nice boost of immunity. But I wouldn’t say that it’s critical that they get vaccinated since vaccines are designed to boost immunity by simulating an infection. And as someone who has had a prior infection they have already gained some immunity. It’s the people who haven’t had it yet that should be getting shots more than anyone else.
0	Uh, you do realize that the reason so many people died in the Black Plague is because vaccinations weren’t a thing? The reason that the Black Plague isn’t really a thing anymore is because most people are vaccinated. Did you ever really think of that?
1	I hope front line workers get the vaccine first cause they deserve it
1	Thank you for the reminder/request for people to get vaccinated. I was lucky and was able to get one early on because of my work, and I am glad my family members are finally able to get it. I live with my brother who has pre-existing conditions and we were very worried about him in the beginning. Even taking Covid out of the equation, if he gets a cold it usually means an ICU stay for him. I am glad that more people in the city/county/state/country are getting vaccinated, but part of me also worries that people will stop being as cautious after getting the vaccine. As a fellow human being, and a family member of someone who is prone to respiratory diseases, thank you for making and sharing this video.
1	God loves us so much he allowed his only Son to be sacrificed for us. (Romans 5:8). Given the unbelievable love and grace of God (so much so that a man condemned to death was given eternal life as he lay bleeding out (Luke 23:43)), I find it hard to believe he would play a game of "Gotcha!" with our salvation.  Nothing about vaccines is remotely sinful. If receiving them damned the recipients, that would go directly against the above-mentioned grace and love of God, because people who take them are doing so to protect their loved ones and neighbors (as you mentioned). God won't "trap" you between choosing between two of His commandments.  When the Mark is introduced, I believe it will be something so obvious to believers as not to leave doubt.
1	69.7% of the world's population, that's 5.35 billion people have had at least one dose of the vaccine. A total of 12.5 billion doses have been given out and 64% are fully vaccinated. It's the biggest rollout of any drug ever since ever. The drug has no higher an incident rate than the contraceptive pill and no one's complaining about that. There are more incidents as there are more doses than there are people - it simply sounds worse than it is. Drugs which have higher risks are on the market and no one complains about them either. It is provably safe, there's more data to back that up than for any other drug ever brought to market. Take the vaccine and feel safer..
1	If that product prevents people from getting infected, why was it that states with the highest rates of usage also had higher rates of infection? (Which was easily shown over the course of 2021 through John's Hopkins data for vaccination rates and worldometer data for case counts?)
1	Got my first jab today and somehow immediately decided that now is the time to scare myself to death by exploring the side effects. By the way, I've had no soreness, no nothing so far. Yay.
0	Vaccines are unsafe and ineffective. Please do your own research.
1	Now it’s really important we get rid of these COVID mutations in Denmark so that the vaccine will actually be effective.
0	Good for her i agree with her, her body her choice. I am not having the wuhan vaccine either.
1	it’s not worth the risk cus you could die and healthy people have been dying from it too.
0	love to see that people are not sheeps.....some folk are using brains in a proper way !!!!!!!!!!!
1	The chances of spreading disease and dying with vaccination is less
0	I am remaining unvaxxed. At all cost that is important.
0	I stood my ground....never took any of this stuff & I am just fine. No one should be forced to take something they may or may not need.
0	quite right too. mandating democide always seemed a tad ‘off’ TBH.
0	Lies about pandemic and institutions that fuel the fear among society… COVID might be a game or more of a trailer for a bigger game. Even the vaccination is a huge mystery.
1	Waiting on my second one! cant wait
1	These new vaccines showcase the power of collaboration and dedication to saving lives.
1	A headache and being sore is way less worse than having the covid.
1	The data shows vaccines reduce the severity of COVID-19 – that's reassuring.
0	How many more bad reactions were unreported because physicians dismissed symptoms as “unrelated” to the shots?
0	Wise man not getting vaccinated
1	If God performs miracles for you and cures you personally you should be canonised as a saint.  Are you a saint? No? Then get the vaccine.
0	dont vaccinate !
1	I get my second dose this Saturday! Hoping for the best
0	Well my dad is a cardiac ICU nurse and a 30 year old nurse that works with him got it and a week later she was dead so no thanks
1	Grateful for the incredible scientists and healthcare workers who made the COVID-19 vaccine possible. Getting vaccinated is our way to say thanks and do our part.
1	There were mild side effects, but trust me it saved our family
1	Prove the vaccine isn't unsafe.
0	Unfortunately the vaccine came too late to help many of us, and it only reduces risk, it doesn't eliminate it.
1	VAX & RELAX
1	You don't want the vax, fine but don't stop others from getting it! Where do these people get off thinking they can or should stop others from getting it?!?!!
0	The idea that I might be forced to vaccinate to keep my job or travel freely is terrifying. It feels like coercion, not choice.
0	The vaccine is not safe!!!!! Read about Professor Delores Cahill a worldwide renowned expert in her field!
1	#DeltaVariant is coming for you don’t be stupid, get vaccinated NOW!
1	I just received the first #Jabbed of COVID-19 vaccine today. I request everyone in #JammuKashmir to get #vaccinated once it’s your turn. Because only together can we save World and beat this virus. #FreeVaccineForAll
0	What about not giving your kid the whackcine?
0	No, I don't trust this and I'll continue masking myself, social distancing, and constantly washing my hands
0	I’m not exactly for the vaccine
1	The BEST ‘treatment’ after COVID-19 is still ‘LESS’ effective than the ‘LEAST’ effective vaccine.
0	The covid vaccine is just a way for pharma to milk money from us
0	Yes, on and off since early December. I have had a full four weeks recovering. Taking higher doses of vitamin C, and D. I have not received the covid vaccine and test negative to covid. This is flu like. I never had covid during the pandemic!
1	Attempts to further explain and educate a brick wall will only render silly and naive anyone who tries. If you are asking, yes I get them [vaccinies]. And no, I do not care to hear why you do not.
0	Ever since getting the covid vaccines, I get insane body aches, random pains, and horrible fatigue. Everyday is 20x harder.
0	Got delta, was sick for a month, haven’t had Covid again or a cold, but guess who’s constantly sick? The vaccinated!
0	I got the virus last month. My symptoms were very mild and I was feeling fine after about a day or two. I've had worse colds. Thank goodness I'm vac...wait a second, I'm unvaccinated.
1	My boyfriend is a polio survivor, if he had access to vaccines and could go back in time to take it he would. Side effects happen, but are often far less disruptive and dangerous to life than the actual disease. Its sad that this is even an argument.
1	If you don't get the vaccine, your odds of getting Covid are very high, and your odds of requiring hospitalization or dying are significantly increased.
1	Got my shot today! Excited for a safer future for everyone. #GotVaccinated #SaferTogether
1	Had covid and didn't die, thanks to the vaccine
1	My sister still refuses to get vaccinated. Her belief “ Why should I get vaccinated to protect other people? No other vaccine works that way!”She unfortunately a teacher of elementary students. Sadly her teenage boys refuse to get vaccinated also due to her influence.
1	“The rest of the World doesn’t think COVID is a big deal ?” Actually the rest of the World would be Thrilled to have the American vaccines for free !!
0	Pure blood here, keep the faith No vaxxers
1	You need the healthy children around your child to be vaccinated so they don't spread these preventable illnesses to yours
0	They're not ignoring them. They're just disappointed that more aren't dying.
1	In my opinion, I agree with Dr. Mike that no one should ever become anti-vaccine because of a negative experience themselves (as long as the vaccine has gone through the proper trials and is safe to use in general)
0	I got the flu shot once and immediately got the flu and eventually pneumonia. Never tempted to get the C19 shot. Vaccines take years to develop safely, not months. It was obvious that people WERE the test subjects. No, thanks.
0	Wife (zero comorbities) comes home with slurred speech, tunnel vision and unable to stand without help. Rushed to the ER and did a CT scan with contrast and found "multiple brain aneurysms". Neurosurgeon got upset when I asked if this could be Vax injury....like I was some crazed conspiracy theorist.
0	The gaslighting around the C19 jabs is OFF THE CHARTS!!!
1	I knew that when getting a vaccine, you will experience side effects but I honestly feel the same way when I had covid. I got the vaccine yesterday and its like my vision had a filter over it. Everything was more pigmented and vibrant. My arm is sore of c
0	NO.  I’ve had two shots and a booster (have not had covid) but now believe the mRNA vaccines compromise the immune system.
0	I regret the first two jabs.
0	THANK GOD I DID NOT GET THE VACCINE
1	The first people we should thank are the doctors and scientists who create such vaccines. The second people we should thank are electronic media (and other forms of media) that assist in explaining the vaccines to laypersons in order to advance humanity beyond the barriers of ignorance and stupidity.
1	medical personnel everywhere support getting vaccinated for covid
0	Not vaxxed and I haven’t been to the doctor or hospital in the past 2 years
1	I saw two homeless guys giving vaccines under the bridge yesterday. We all do our parts, stay safe out there
1	I'm currently caring for a 6 year old with tetanus in the ICU. It breaks my heart seeing her mom crying all day. Tetanus is completely avoidable with a simple vaccine. Same to covid ...
0	Why vaccinate against diseases that don't exist anymore?
0	Thank GOD I didn’t get jabbed. Feel terrible for all the trusting individuals who thought they were doing the responsible thing. So sad
1	Let's all do our part to build immunity and safeguard our communities please.
1	Efficacy 95% vs Efficacy 68% Phizer and Astra were developed at the same time and Phizer has higher efficacy.
1	Thank you for my vaccine. For the physical immunity and mental relief I will gain in coming weeks. And congratulations. #VaccineThanks #OxfordAstraZeneca #grateful
1	The one thing that makes me worry is that most of my friends (as am I) are under 18 and don't have the power to make the decision to vaccinate themselves. I'm vaccinated, but my closest friend is unvaccinated and wants to get the vaccine but his parents won't let him because "you're young and have a good immune system" and this makes me worry
1	My second dose wasn't to bad, I was just really tired and headache, and of course a sore arm. Next day I was fine. I heard having some sort of reaction means its a good thing... your body is doing what it should be doing and fighting off the intruders.
1	Not everyone has a healthy immune system, for one reason or another. Those people often cannot mount a strong enough immune response upon receiving the vaccine, and so we need to protect those people as best we can. Get the vaccine. Wear a mask.
0	The vaccine is a symbol of hope and a tool for reclaiming our lives from the grip of the pandemic.
1	The benefits of vaccination far outweigh the risks associated with COVID-19.
0	Studying vaccine development prior to the COVID outbreak gave me all the information I needed to refuse the new vaccines.
1	"Every rose , has it's thorn , just like every night , has it's dawn , just like every cowboy sings a sad  ...sad  song" (Bill S. Preston Esquire and Ted Theodore Logan)
0	According to WHO COVID is not over, will our Governments step up and fight this deadly virus, people are not masking and are not up-to-date on vaccines. Canada must do better, fines,imprisonment for not being caught up on vaccines is a good incentive. Vulnerable people are human!
0	I’m good I don’t need a booster because I refused, in good judgement, to take the vaccine to begin with
0	It’s all bullshit mate, data that’s been lied about to cause fear to get the vaccine - can’t u see how it’s all about the vaccine nothing else? Don’t believe in goverment data and instead go outside and open your eyes, talk to people because everyone vaccinated is getting Problems now. I mean hospitals are putting covid on peoples death certificates when they died of other reasons if they can lie about that what else can they do? Open your eyes and turn off the news and stop reading goverment articles, they don’t have your best interest trust me.
0	if the pro-vaxxers would go ahead and let us know when the vaccine kicks in and prevents Covid, that’d be great too
1	It's not hard to push through a few days of annoying side effects to possibly save others' lives.
0	If my job try’s to make me get vacation I will quit
0	“People have the right to make their own decision”   Reporter: and that’s where she was wrong
1	As a healthcare worker, seeing the decline in hospitalizations and severe cases after the vaccination rollout affirmed my trust in its effectiveness.
0	I will never take the vaccine.
0	My uncle developed myocarditis after receiving his Pfizer “vaxx”. Poor guy can’t work anymore, 45 years old.
0	i have not take a vaccine and thank god i did not take it, i had covid but recover from it without vaccine and now my immune system is much stronger
0	Its much safer just to get a cold or flu at least theres no side effects in 2 weeks your well again!
0	I'm sick asf after vaccine
0	They call them "boosters" because every time you are forced to take one it boosts the company's profit
1	I got vaccinated and so should you! Let's beat this virus together and get back to the things we love
0	I am an athlete. I got my second dose of the covid vaccine 3 days ago. The next day after the vaccine, I couldn't sleep. I had the worst fever ever. Today is my 3rd day after the second shot, I feel normal but my stamina when I workout is not the same. I feel like I get fatigued much faster than before and I run out of breath much faster than I used to. I swear I am not lying.
1	Feeling the weight lift off my shoulders after getting vaccinated was indescribable. It's the first step towards healing.
1	Encountered this video and I LOVED it ! well done Vox :: new subscriber btw B). this will indeed help people get vaccinated and stop falling for false rumors form media and news. its outrageous
0	I'm worried about being pressured into a decision
1	They keep saying no link between vaccines and autism, but studies of autistic people show abnormally high levels of aluminum (which is the main adjuvant in vaccines).  https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0946672X17308763  Plus there are tons of YouTube videos where parents videotaped their children before and after vaccines and you can clearly see them alert and happy before vaccines and autistic afterwards.  https://youtu.be/ze_Hlkz8dDs
1	Oh Yes, I got my 2nd dose thursday and went to bed that night. Woke up at 3A.M. with horrible body aches that lasted for 24 hours. But it was still worth it.
1	They don't even realize the brainwashing.  They trust authority so much and don't even consider that they might be lying or covering something up.
0	Yeah because medicine and technology wasn't as advanced as it is today. We've grown leaps and bounds since then.
1	I Love you Pfizer
1	I have been reading up on the mRNA use of protein cells to trigger the immune response instead of previous technology of using the actual disease cells. I think this is just amazing!!!
1	I was nervous about getting the vaccine at first, but my children encouraged me to do it. I got it and had no symptoms at all except a slight sore arm on the first one. I'm so glad that I got the vaccine. If I can do my part to stop the spread of this horrible disease then it is worth it in my eyes.
1	i went to an anti-vaxxer convention, but all I got was this measley shirt
0	They’re not putting that crap in me, my husband had the vax for covid and he caught covid faster than normal and had to have a infusion to treat it
0	The covidvaccine causes turbocancer
0	natural remedies are far more effective than these artificial cocktails!!!
1	My dad is high risk and got the first of two covid shots, he's getting his second one today and he has felt completely fine.
1	"The science behind the vaccines is solid, and the benefits far outweigh any potential risks."
1	Just got mine today! We got the shipment in yesterday, and the hospital starting handing them out right away.  No side effects so far, and it was quick and and almost completely painless.
1	I got the booster yesterday and feel great! No side effects!
0	There are countless lawsuits against drugs that seemed safe at conception but then we found out they are deadly 5-10 years down the road. No thanks, I'm not taking my chances on a drug hastily whipped together by people with questionable motives.
1	I’m a high risk patient, always caught whatever flu was running rampant cuz my immune system is shit. Yes I had 2 shots/3 boosters. I got COVID from an idiot who was proud 2be #AntiVax. He died, I had a sore throat & sick for a week. No one said the vaccine was 100%. I AM ALIVE
1	Doctors and experts wouldn’t have taken the vaccine if it were dangerous
0	Standing up to tyranny, lying scientists, drug company profiteers, political and media propaganda, and the brainwashed masses with truth and courage.
1	Already got my vaccine and booster shot, doing well. It’s been a month or so and no further complications.
0	No one has ever died from a virus because viruses are a hoax
1	This girl over here tried to “out smart” a Doctor about MEDICATION I am DECEASED
1	Vaccines have played a crucial role in preventing diseases and improving public health worldwide.
1	Thanks for always teaching us the right way to good health
0	Nobody regrets not getting the jab.
0	'Safe and effective' ........... Died suddenly.
0	it's not even FDA approved. We're test subjects at this point
0	Saw a scary post about side effects. No vaccine for me, thanks.
0	My mother’s healthcare place called to get permission to give my 90-year-old mother one of the vaccines and I said no way
1	You have like a 1 in a million chance of getting a clot from the vaccine. Stop lying.
1	I got the vaccine and a booster. My girlfriend did too. We’re both fine. She got pregnant in November 2021, about 6ish months after we both got the original vaccine. You’re fine.
0	Don’t argue… if you believe it’s safe and effective, continue with the boosters every 6 months. Go on, if you DARE.
1	I took a basic biology.class pre-covid. It's amazing how "the science" has changed. The vaccine doesn't stop the spread, it slows the spread. You're still going to contract the virus even if you're vaccinated, but you will have a secondary immune response, which will allow your body to recover in half the time. That's it.
1	I’m only 24 yo and generally healthy, when I had covid I had really bad fever for 3 days, can’t imagine how bad it could be without vaccine
0	Dear fellow purebloods. Stay strong
1	Bruh just imagine explaining medical stuff to a doctor that spent years studying that same medical stuff, and an extra decade+ of an experience
1	It is sad that people get caught up in conspiracies that take their lives unnecessarily 😔
0	This whole subreddit is retarded and so are the people who believe that you shouldn't vaccinate your kids
0	We do have the data and the data shows it wasn't worth it.
0	Nobody regrets not getting the jab.
1	I once had a nightmare where Antivaxxers took over the UN and banned vaccines
1	Yeah… don’t recommend getting a covid vaccine right before an 8 hour work shift 🥴
0	No one wants to be poisoned. That's why the site is empty. #vaccine #vaccines #covidvaccine #covidvaccines
0	the problem is that some people are being coerced or forced to take certain vaccines to go to school or keep their jobs, and medical exemptions are not always possible
1	Most of the staff at the hospital where I work had the AZ, I know of only 1 person that was unwell (flu like systems, the rest of us had no side effects and carried on working. There seems to be a lot of bad media hype over this.
0	"And to think that I didn't get vaccinated against COVID, nor the flu, still healthy."
1	The more people vaccinated, the better off the country will be!
1	Seeing our community come together to get vaccinated gives me hope for brighter days ahead.
1	I got the two Modernas, two Moderna boosters, and on Monday got a Pfizer booster. Regret? I have not been sick since the spring of 2001.
0	$11 million in gov’t compensation given to Canadians injured by COVID vaccines
1	i'm in Tennessee. PUT IT IN ME.
0	I don't believe in the one-size-fits-all approach to vaccination.
0	This is what you call proper explanation of the vaccine efficacy statistics.
1	#MedTwitter So happy and grateful to have gotten the first dose of the vaccine!!
1	Vaccinated and boostered. Was exposed over Christmas, tested positive and had only mild symptoms.  So thankful.
1	being vaccinated= baddie energy
0	Barely anyone dies from a vaccination, and those that do, are allergic. It has nothing to do with the vaccine supposedly being “dangerous”. Not to mention the chance of having any sort of reaction to a vaccine, severe or not, is 1 in 10,000,000. Do your research, dickhead.
1	Tell us you don’t understand how vaccines work without telling us you don’t understand how vaccines work. lol
1	I fully support vaccines! They have saved countless lives and prevented countless diseases. Vaccines are one of the greatest medical advancements of our time.
0	Someone who was perfectly healthy then had 3 heart attacks and other symptoms . It is perfectly reasonable to assume it might be a vaccine injury.
0	Dr. Mikolaj Raszek on New Evidence Showing Possible Genome Integration of the Pfizer COVID Vaccine in Long-COVID Patients “They were able to show that there is a band and then they sequenced it…There is a sequence within the genome of these cells that corresponds to the Pfizer mRNA. Not identical but very similar and they say this suggests that perhaps the genetic material has been incorporated.”
1	As a youngster in the 50s, before we had vaccines for these, here is what I had to suffer through: measles, mumps, rubella and chicken pox. My mother had polio. After the vaccines, no one had to go through those awful illnesses. Am I vaccinated today? You bet I am. I am so grateful . I have had the vaccines for polio, diphtheria, pertussis, pneumonia, hepatitis, Tetanus, shingles, COVID, HPV, and every year the flu vaccine.
0	Risks you say? Well when businesses were mandating it for people to work without them knowing the risks. I'm just so grateful that I never took the vaccine even though I lost my 20 year career at a hospital. I'm still alive. Had covid 14 months ago . No problem. My symptoms were less than my friends that are vaccinated.
1	It blows my mind that people are scared of the COVID-19 vaccine citing things like blood clots and myocarditis when COVID itself causes these issues at a much, much higher rate.
0	Thank you for re posting this, Doc Stuckelberger I just want you to know that I respect and admire your courage so much for speaking up against this #Covid #Vaccine poison. Wish you nothing but good energy and love, if there is anything I can do to help your cause, please let me know
1	In the game of health, vaccines are the undisputed champions. Join the winning side.
0	The longer this has gone on, the more relieved I am that I never got the jab.
0	The science is clear. The mRNA vaccines font work, and have an extremely high rate of severe, life,-changing or life ending side effects. Its criminal to keep selling this deadly product.
0	I'll get the vaccine whenever Hell freezes over
1	I took the vaccine but I just heard that my grandpa's tested positive from the virus he didn't take the vaccine yet but I'm really worried what if it's too late he won't have his vaccine I don't know what would I do without him
1	Adams - your analogy touted by that more people die from the flu than #COVID19 is missing a few facts; less than 0.01% die from flu; Covid is rate is 3.1%. Most who die from the flu did not get a flu vaccine!! #clustertrump
1	If you're going to have your child in public they need to be vaccinated.
1	I've had 5 boosters in total, plus the originals. I've also had a mix of different manufacturers. I like that because each is has a different profile
1	Here is a great reason to get vaccinated. Long Covid otherwise known as Post Covid Syndrome or Long Haul Covid doesn’t go away. I got Covid in March of 2020 and have been almost completely incapacitated for 22 months now. It would be wonderful if you made a similar short documentary on the people not getting better for years.
1	Even with the newer variants , these vaccines seem to work right now , and the more people that can get vaccinated quickly , the fewer hosts will exist where the virus mutates to possibly a more contagious form .
1	Vaccine day! Here's to getting back to normal life.
0	NO TO VACCINES NO TO MICROCHIP
1	Well, get vaccinated and you won’t have anything to worry about. Unless you have a legitimate medical reason that prevents you from getting a vaccine, there’s no reason that you don’t get one.
0	Unvaccinated and proud, and you need to take a good look in the mirror if you pressured anyone into getting that garbage
1	Of course this anti vaccine nonsense is only in the first world
0	I have a family member that’s been having seizures from it
1	"I believe in the power of community immunity. Let's protect each other by getting vaccinated."
0	Still unvaccinated and healthy as ever thank you Jesus ❤️
1	The vaccines reduce the symptoms, that's why they have an efficacy rating, they do not eliminate any chance you get the virus.Yes we know they work, for example in Australia only 6% of the population is unvaccinated yet 50% of ICU cases are from that small percentage.
1	And this is why I explained to my in laws this weekend that I won't be taking my baby (due in August) on a plane to them until the baby is old enough to have their vaccinations. Because idiots like this, who refuse to vaccinate their children, endanger other people's lives.
1	Anti-VAXXers are like people who randomly sleep around without any protection.
0	dont care, still not taking it
1	Vaccines save lives. I’ve had eight Covid vaccines.  I feigned a lost Covid card and crossed state lines.  Vaccines matter. People need to stop thinking they get a medical and or law degree from google. It is insane.
1	I remember being amazed when the COVID-19 vaccine was made so quickly, and after watching this, I am even more amazed by how revolutionary this new way of making vaccines is.
1	I'm so pro vaccine.  I love science.  It's so awesome.  I absolutely fell in love with all this nerdy stuff when I saw a picture of the spike protein. It was too beautiful.
1	Here in Thailand, we barely have any vaccines, people are desperate to get vaccinated, and less that 10% of us are vaccinated. It feels very unfair that Americans just shoo it away when so many of us would have it in a heartbeat.
1	I trust in the science behind the vaccines. They’re the result of years of research and expertise.
0	I personally know of four that died after their first jab. Two others now have rare cancers after their jabs. Must be climate change!
0	What happened to my body, my choice?
1	Everyone's talking about the COVID vaccine like it's a one-and-done deal. Remember, booster shots are common for many vaccines, and that helps keep immunity strong over the years.
1	The success of vaccination programs is evident in the decline of numerous infectious diseases.
1	thanks for sharing your experience. my first dose of moderna was equally rough. as a preface, i had a "mild" case of covid at the end of dec into early jan. got my 1st shot this last monday and about 7 hours in, things took a big turn. super bad headache, muscle aches, felt exhausted f/b nausea and chills. very gradually got better but it took 3 days to really feel ok. i really worked hard to hydration too. tylenol helped some. getting my second shot in late april. dreading it but we gotta do what we gotta do, right?
0	Of course we can’t blame the “vaccine” but it’s ok to blame the dead victim.
1	Great slap of reality in that message! I really applaud the White House getting deadly serious about the risks of Covid and how to avoid it for yourself, your children and those around you.
0	The problem is, we don't have long term data on the vaccine. That's why some people don't want the vaccine.
0	Covid was more one of the greatest hoaxes of modern times
0	That's because the vax causes immune errosion Spike is horrible to have in your body. So when you get vaccinated, you create spike each time, before, hopefully, antibodies get made to destroy the Spike. But it's not fast enough to get rid of it before it hurts your immune system
1	Did you hear about today? Covid-19 cases in just United States in one day is 277,000+. Every second 3 people get tested positive. Get your vaccination. We’re in this together.
0	No way in hell I am giving this to my children.
0	I didn’t get COVID vaccine and I’m an Rn treating COVID patients and I haven’t gotten it . I have an immune system
0	Not heard anyone say they regretted NOT having the jab.
0	Not heard anyone say they regretted NOT having the jab.
1	My aunt died because of Covid. She wasn't vaccinated. To take this risk, get the shot!
1	I got the 3 shots and I didn't get sick any time. I'm from Brazil. Here the vaccination was slow at the beginning, but now we are almost finishing!
1	I’m on my 15th booster shot and I feel great
0	Some glad i skipped this experiment. Good luck folks. Edit: Great video doc, better hope the story doesnt change? Could be very bad for folks who pushed this poison.
1	Got my shots for the peace of mind and the safety of my community. Vaccination is a powerful tool against COVID-19.
0	A reason I said no. Already having psoriasis and having it controlled with diet, I didn't want to rock the boat and mess my life up. Sadly, many not so lucky.
0	I think the evidence is overwhelming that something is happening which is not being acknowledged by official health services. It's just crazy and will ruin trust in health provisions for generations. Health regulators need to examine their conscience
1	Got my first shot yesterday so far no feeling of side effect. Ty Pfrizer
1	Tetanus is real. I’ve had shots after stepping on a nail. Like Covid you don’t want to wait until it’s too late
1	I love everything about this. I wish Canada took the same stance. No more sympathy for these people who are willfully unvacinated.
1	Despite Canada's presently high COVID infection rate, our hospitals have not yet been overwhelmed by a surge of cases cuz of our high vaccination rates. Isn't that funny how that works?
0	I’m good I don’t need a booster because I refused, in good judgement, to take the vaccine to begin with
1	Some of you need to worry more about the chicken nuggets in your freezer than the vaccine #COVID19 #vaccine
1	I should shortly be offered a vaccine but may get a choice if I wait longer but now feel reassured that all the vaccines are effective
0	My s-i-l died May 2021 after her AZ. Within 2 days of the jab she was in ICU, dead within 2 weeks, lungs full of blood clots. Aged 46. RIP Kate.
0	So glad I did not take the shot or test.
0	Said the company making truckloads off vaccines. Pfizer, Moderna, JJ, all should be prosecuted with crimes against humanity.
1	Im so happy for finally getting a vaccine, have been waiting for ages. I feel much safer now
1	Nobody is trying to kill you with an unsafe vaccine. The data is in, the vaccine underwent testing; it’s proven safe & effective.
1	I didn’t know antivaxxers knew how to read! Good for them!
1	COVID-19 survivor's plea, urging others to embrace vaccination, preventing suffering.
1	STOP SAYING VACCINES DON'T WORK, IT DID WORK!!!!!!!!!
1	I don’t care if people don’t want to get vaccinated. That’s their decision. What I don’t like is when they make everyone else look like the idiots. They think it’s a worldwide conspiracy. Hope half of these people get refused from hospital
1	Got my pfizer 1st doz yesterday in ksa. Its great.
1	Tell yourselves whatever you want. Thank God I'm unvaccinated. All my vaxxed friends keep getting sick from Covid. Kind of defeats the purpose eh?
1	When people start doing their own research, that is a dangerous path. Most people consider looking online as research, please don't trust yourself if you are not a medical professional that actually does real research. You're not doing research, you're looking for something that fits your opinion. Doing research would be actually talking to medical professionals, getting other opinions from people that have done real research. And as far as the "I know my kid better than the doctor" yes that's true, but not from a medical stand point (unless you yourself are a medical professional). The doctor will always know your child's medical needs just a little better than you assuming you're not a doctor yourself, it's what they do for a living.
0	Get vaccinated and avoid long covid. Risk blood clots, stroke, myocarditis and fk knows what else AND you still catch covid! It’s a lose lose! But hey… gotta get that coin in WHO ain’t that right? 🤑🤑🤑🤑🤮🤮🤮
1	Vaccines may be every where  but that will not help to cure pandemic we have to be vaccinated
0	Haven't had a vaccine in 6 years, I recommend we quit vaccines for less threatening diseases.
0	🤖 beep trust the beep science boop
0	More cons than pros with these vaccines
0	NEVER putting that poison in my body! WHOever tries to give me or a loved one a shot gets one first!
1	I got both shots of pfizer.  I got covid about 5 months later and was short of breath and couldn’t stop coughing nonstop for about a week.  I’m lucky I’m extremely active and healthy.  I had a tenant who was unvaccinated, he was 24 and healthy, a little heavy for his age like 70% of us.  He knew he was sick but thought he would would just work through it, he ended up in the ICU on a ventilator for several days, almost died.  His girlfriend was almost due to have their baby.  I urge everyone to get the vaccine I’m glad I did.  I may not be here if I hadn’t.
0	Yes let’s all get vaccinated so that we can literally not change our behavior at all and wear masks and social distance regardless of vaccination status
1	And the vaccine companies admit that the vaccines can cause some serious problems.   It's on the fucking label.
1	After I got my vaccines, I had terrible side-effects. Painful headaches, body soreness, and fatigue. Basically they made a whole day for me miserable. At least now I know how and why.
1	The fight against covid-19 depends on everyone!!
0	Dang look at all these bots saying “vaccines” are good
1	Fuck antivax nurses
1	I am at the point where when I hear “I am anti-vaccine” I just hear “I am uneducated”
0	95% effective for a virus that kills at 0.5%.
1	Being on a ventilator sounds horrifying. Glad I’m triple vaxxed so I’m safe from things like that
0	FDA admitted COVID 19 shots cause heart inflammation and Canada commissionor for citizens advice putting COVID 19 shots off the market this shot is purely to cause more suffering
1	Wait till the anti vax population is susceptible to polio, once people relive the horrors of polio many will be singing a different tune
1	VAXXED AND READY TO ROCK!
1	If vaccinations cause autism, measles, the common cold, and a lot of other viruses and infections will cause autism too, right?
0	Not sure if I am posting correctly but so glad I found this forum and have been reading everyone's posts. I got my first Pfizer vaccine 3/15. The next day I felt buzzy, almost hung over, in my head and a bit nauseous. It went away fairly quickly and I was fine for the next 6 days. On the 7th day the feeling in my head returned out of no where and was more intense. I feel, dizzy and cloudy, nauseous, I have a funny feeling in my throat, the back of my neck is sore and I periodically get numbness and tingling in my hands and face. This is not full on vertigo for me  as I have experience with that, but def vertigo like. Its manageable  as long as I am careful and stay home. I am a 50 yr old mom of 8 and although I have an autoimmune disease I was perfectly fine before the shot. I am scheduled to have 2nd shot 4/5 but doubt I will. I'm terribly nervous it will get worse with the 2nd shot and would not have the support I would need if I ended up debilitated with vertigo. I feel so frustrated with this experience.
1	Vaccines provide a layer of protection for those who are most vulnerable, including infants and the elderly.
0	I and my family lost everything for saying NO. Our jobs, our money, our house, our family, our friends, and people still treat us like leppers. But we DON'T mind, we are all healthy, we are all alive, we all have had Covid with no serious health effects, whereas many we know now are dead, dying, or have serious life changing side effects. NEVER FORGIVE NEVER FORGET
0	What!?? Get boosted no matter if its not safe???????????
0	Unvaxed for life
0	Oh don't worry. it's mostly water with a few secret ingredients!!! ha ha ha haaaaaaaaaaa...
1	They don't work as well but they still reduce severity a great deal.
1	Jordan: So would the founding fathers be against a vaccine mandates? Republican: yes Jordan: George Washington instituted a vaccine mandate. Republican: 👁️👄👁️.
1	I've been vaxxed twice. First with J&J, and just got Pfizer last week. My whole family is vaxxed, including my 12-year-old son. The company I work for has over 300 employees, and everyone is good since their shot. I have not heard from a single person that I know personally of any issues with any of the shots.
1	Took my booster and feeling great.
1	I'm sorry to hear of your loss. Did he get an mRNA vaccine? There is zero evidence that they have caused any blood clots. Skipping an mRNA vaccination dose would not have prevented this tragedy, but it would have put him at risk for severe disease and death from COVID.
1	the data on the vaccine's safety is overwhelming. billions of doses have been administered worldwide. there's much more risk in buckling into a motor vehicle & driving on a freeway than there is in getting a covid vaccine.
1	I trust science more then conspiracy theorists who try to sell their followers horse medicines lol
1	I got the Pfizer (1st dose) on the 25th. My arm was sore for two days and that’s all. No side effects or sickness. I feel great. Good to see you are feeling better
1	I have gotten better. Many people got better with the vaccine. Talk to doctors. There are newspaper articles about this. The vaccine reversed long COVID in some people.
1	Vaccinated and feeling good! Let's end this pandemic
0	Not putting that poison in my body.
0	Thank you for speaking the truth. And to the unvaccinated...we salute you
0	The covid 19 shots destroyed natural immunity
1	I am very glad I decided to get vaccinated- I am chronically ill in several ways, including severe asthma and a haywire immune system
1	Fewer vaccinated Republicans, may lead to fewer Republicans. One can decide for themselves if that is a good thing or not.
1	I'm just getting over COVID now. Four days ago I was the sickest I've ever been in my life - even after being covid-positive and asymptomatic as recently as this last February, and having had mild cases on three separate occasions prior to that. My last booster was almost two years ago to date.  I cannot recommend enough that everyone get their booster annually.
1	The vaccines are not 100% effective, don't work against all strains, but THEY DO REDUCE HOSPITALIZATIONS AND DEATHS!
1	For an entirely new technology that hasn’t seen a single approved product, that's a big deal; the coronavirus showing proved it can be quickly pivoted for a pandemic pathogen. But its usefulness in other diseases? That could be a different story, two industry watchers figure.
0	My body my choice! If the vaccine work, vaccinated people shouldn't be afraid of unvaccinated people hence, unvaccinated people are no risk to anyone but themselves!
0	Natural immunity is the way to go. Vaccines are a scam.
0	The amount of relief I feel that I didn't get vaccinated, even though I was pressured by almost every member of my family, is absolutely indescribable! I feel sorry for those who got it though. Best of luck, they're definitely gonna need it.
1	People who are unaware will talk bad about the vaccine
1	I'm super happy for you💖😆... I hope someday everyone can get it, I'm tired of this vIrUS😭
0	Length of testing too short
0	Why are vacinated people still dying?
0	Mandatory vaccination infringes on personal freedom and bodily autonomy.
0	MANDATE MADNESS, STOP THE CLOT SHOTS!
0	a number of papers have been published recently finding that the spike protein on its own is NOT "harmless" and can in fact be very dangerous, even on its own!
0	Every day I am a little more pissed that my job required us to get the shot.
1	Immunizations have proven to be a cost-effective public health strategy.
1	So you'd rather kill millions people than just give them a cheap vaccine?  Measles were pretty much eliminated but some dumb fucks decided to not vaccinate their children, it's extremely contagious so of course it came back when it wasn't fully gone.  Natural immunity is the same thing as a vaccine, just that the vaccines don't try to kill you whilst the disease does.
1	Yes. All those folks can get vaccinated and play. Easy breezy.
1	Thank you so much for these vaccines. You have saved umpteen millions of lives , I'm sorry if people underscore your achievements .
0	The death jab, period
0	Once more, my wife and I were saved by our nurse-related senses tingling, telling us to avoid the vaccine at all costs.
0	My immune system is like cheap toilet paper right now. Became allergic to damn everything. Urticaria aka hives! Right leg muscles are weak.
1	I signed up to be a vaccine tester with AstraZeneca, with my screening and injection scheduled for Monday. I have been informed there's a 33% chance I'll get a placebo instead of a vaccine but I think that was kind of my way of trying to get a vaccine as early as possible?
1	One shot closer to normal. Get vaccinated!
1	Here is a great reason to get vaccinated. Long Covid otherwise known as Post Covid Syndrome or Long Haul Covid doesn’t go away. I got Covid in March of 2020 and have been almost completely incapacitated for 22 months now. It would be wonderful if you made a similar short documentary on the people not getting better for years.
1	Vaccines are a testament to human ingenuity in facing global challenges.
1	finally im vaccinated!
0	I've never seen so much lying and deception surrounding any one particular topic before covid, in my entire life.
0	Why do we still refer to these shots as vaccines. It’s doesn’t prevent infection or spread. Biggest lie and misinformation. Changing the definition of vaccine to propagate a lie that Covid treatments used today are a vaccine.
0	I would love to hear you talk about the blood brain barrier, and the fact that these things shouldn’t even be getting through! At least that is my limited understanding! I am an RN, and, of course, initially they were trying to force the vaccines on us under the threat of being fired. I ended up taking the first Pfizer vaccine under duress and I experienced two days of pretty severe cognitive impairment. Thank God at the last minute the hospital reversed its stance and said we could test weekly instead of getting the vaccine. I wish I had never even gotten the first one, but I am grateful that I did I didn’t have to continue the assault on my body. Thank you for everything you do!
0	The longer this has gone on, the more relieved I am that I never got the jab.
1	Boris Johnson warned that up to 90% of people in intensive care with Covid had not had their booster jabs. The UK has the highest booster vaccination rate in Europe, with 58% of over-12s having received one.
1	Every vaccine administered is a victory over Covid-19. Proud to contribute.
1	Great vid! I was wondering if anyone knows if ethnicity  is realated to side effects?  My mother, my brother and myself didn't feel any side effects at all. I'm worried that could meen the shot didn't work. We are of mexican desendant (so a mixture of native american and south european) and we took Pfizer's first shot.
0	So now this tinpot government are going to exploit what they call "Respectable Celebrities" to brainwash the public into having the vaccine. How shallow is it possible to get? They are treating the public with utter contempt
1	Come on… without vaccine we won’t be here not wearing mask and healthy….we all know that…
0	Unvaxxed and it was the most mild sickness I've ever had. Sniffles and a slight cough.
0	Sure FDA are the same people who approved Oxi as safe
1	What the fuck? Its not a conspiracy that the vaccines have been congressionally protected from liability cases. Its not a conspiracy that out of the "thousands of studies none of which i believe" not one has a placebo or double blind group, thus making the study effectively worthless. Its not a conspiracy that pharmaceutical execs regularly become FDA execs. And half 50% of the measles cases in this outbreak ARE KIDS WHO HAVE BEEN VACCINATED! This is all straight up CNN headlines. Do you just refuse to believe anything that isnt spoon fed to you by your Facebook group?
0	I got all 3 vaccines and recently have had Covid I’ve never been so sick in my entire life! I wish i never would’ve got the vaccines
0	do realize these 'vaccines' are experimental, not vetted; they are not fda approved and you can't sure vaccine makers for any permanent damage. For more info see dr. Sherri tenpenny. There are many whistle blowers but Google 'covid vaccines not fda approved'. There was a miracle pill called HCQ but it was pulled and now people are at the mercy of am experimental biological agent? You have the right to refuse, its called informed consent.
0	FACTS: 1) 600K died from FLU (2018-2019 season) 2) 1.2 Million estimated will die from flu (2019-2020 season) 3) Flu vaccine works less than half time. 4) There is off label treatment for #Covid19 that is working world wide. STOP MISLEADING PEOPLE over ur bias.
0	if the goal of your video was to convince me to get the jab it had the opposite effect.
1	Vaccinated people also carry a lower viral load. They clear the virus faster than unvaccinated. Therefore they are less infectious due to a shorter period of time carrying the virus
1	m tired of politicians playing science when they know nothing
0	Its the Chinese Flu and the experimental jab. until those morons start calling it that we should never trust them! Its all theatrics to those low life bottom feeders.
0	scarified the children to the Mulak. And Fauci so proud to do it! The money they raked in, this is true crime of 1 st degree murder.
0	The vaccine is the virus
0	Feel publicity of COVID-19 vaccine is inadequate
0	Dying from safe and effective profits?! Sheep still want more shots!! Breakthrough cases are rampant.
0	Vaccine hesitancy is a reflection of a growing distrust in the healthcare system and pharmaceutical industry.
0	After receiving the Pfizer vaccine within two weeks I developed extreme to severe rheumatoid arthritis severe pain constantly nobody get this shot
0	What disgusts and angers me about this so much is that she's a nurse--a medical practitioner--someone people trust with their very lives, and she's spreading this kind of misinformation, allowing her emotions and personal biases to cloud her thinking, and risking people's lives as a result! She's trained in knowing how to prevent her biases from effecting her judgement, and taught the very real dangers thar come as a result of doing so, and taught how alowing bias to effect the judgments she makes can cost people their lives, and yet she is STILL allowing her bias to cloud her thinking! And she is endangering people's lives as a result by doing so, because people listen to nurses, and place their very lives in nurse's hands! Thinking that she knows better than the thousands of medical practitioners worldwide advocating the vaccine is utterly disgusting hubris in the extreme that can cost people their lives! It's people like her  that do not deserve the privilege of practicing medicine!
1	I got mine on the 27th of feb, my arm itched a little and the area was tender and somewhat red but a few days later it all passed and I went back to normal. We owe so much to the amazing people who made this possible and I hope they know how grateful I am for all their amazing work.
0	the FDA should be disbanded... the fact that it keeps pushing the covid vaccine is enough proof for me that they are political
0	I had my first jab yesterday but I've been nauseous and weak ever since plus got a running stomach. As someone that hasn't fallen sick on a decade this sucks.
1	Fully vaccinated and boosted for added protection! My son and his wife had COVID, but we stayed vigilant. Vaccination is our shield against the virus.
0	I support the Anti-Vaxxers and Kanye West all the way.
0	Vax failed
0	I knew COVID was a hoax because after fifteen years of not getting any vaccines, they had to let me know I was in a “pandemic” which is something I would know without any individual telling me or hearing about it on social media.
0	My body, my choice. Don't force your vaccines on me.
0	Both my mother and step mother died shortly after 2nd booster a month apart . Can't believe these two are gone now! Very lonely!
0	If they were that good you wouldn't keep trying to convince people!!
0	The data shows that alarming rise of excess death is strongly correlated to release of the covid-vaxin and boosters, not to the covid itself.
1	Unable to get vaccinated but trust me I wish I could and I’m getting poked the second I can
0	My understanding is they are still going to do clinical trials, but will start giving the shots before they are finished.
1	In a nutshell: Don't worry, those things are safe and effective.
1	Thank you Hank! Something I would like to add... I am a little worried about people wanting to rush and get the vaccine when there will only be a limited number of doses available in the beginning stages. I hope that those who are like me (mid-20's, relatively healthy, able to stay home, not immunocompromised) will do their part and WAIT. Let the healthcare and essential workers, the immunocompromised, and the elderly get the vaccines first without complaint.
0	I said it at the beginning, soon people with 5 shots will be blaming people with 4... For having to get a 6th
0	I'll pass on the vaccine and let my immune system do its job.
1	vaccines DO work. Read up on the history
1	Nah, I’m sitting pretty here. More and more trials get approved and we even have paxlovid now. Things have only gotten better with time. It works, just like how ALL the other vaccines we take work. Polio, rubella, measles, etc. All those vaccines work. They have been working. They will continue to work. Science only gets better over time. Feels good man.
0	Grateful to God to remain unvaccinated.
0	Who else got fired cause refused to get a covid-19 vaccine?
1	Every vaccination brings us closer to ending the pandemic. Let's keep going
0	Stay away from the poison
1	Here in Thailand, we barely have any vaccines, people are desperate to get vaccinated, and less that 10% of us are vaccinated. It feels very unfair that Americans just shoo it away when so many of us would have it in a heartbeat.
0	They wanted to treat us like LAB RATS. THIS MAN SPEAKING IS INCOMPETENT, FOOL, THIS WAS ALL PLANNED, PLANDEMIC
1	Guys thanks a lot for this, my mom had Astra Zeneca and was worried about low efficacy, I'm glad I can explain to her how that works!
1	Get vaccinated right now! It is taken orally, is free, and is safe.
0	I wish people would talk about rsv more. It nearly took me out. It's not JUSt covid out there.
1	Incredibly honored to draw up COVID vaccine doses for my badass colleagues!! I cannot wait for my turn! #teamhurley
1	I got my second Pfzer vaccine yesterday We're all making history here
1	“I don’t know if it’s bad, but I also don’t know if it’s good, so I shouldn’t get it.” Impeccable logic from the woman who’s sitting in a hospital room
0	Long-term effects are a big unknown. I'm holding off.
1	As someone who has recently lost family to COVID (unvaccinated) while other vaccinated family members never even had to go to the hospital, I'm thankful you're spreading truth about this. Be well.
1	This vaccine is special because it triggers an immune response without using the actual virus that causes covid-19.
0	Efficacy doesn't really stop with only two vaccinations! Booster shots will likely be a ongoing theme throughout their now pin cushion lives.
0	If the death rate for Covid19 was say, 20%, then I could see the urgency for everyone being vaccinated.
1	I got vaccinated because I believe in the power of science to overcome challenges.
1	I had 1st shot of Pfizer yesterday morning, no severe sad effects, just felt hungry and about 30 minutes light headache in the afternoon. I have been on diet. Yesterday I had to eat three good meals, with carb, red meat, vegetables, fruits, nuts, fish now I feel normal.
0	My mother died 20 days after her vaccination - 24 hours after vax - she got thrombocytopenia and died a horrific death. Never will forgive for what happened.
1	I've had Covid-19 and spent a week in a hospital and almost ended up on a vent. I'm 29, work as a paramedic, and am in perfect health except for my dad-bod. I'll be camped outside of CVS waiting for this vaccine.
1	Meanwhile my sister in law is still sending her entire family random conspiracy theory TikToks while calling us all sheep and her and her antivax husband is in hospital with his kidneys failing. There’s no amount of data that will prove anything to anyone who’s made up their mind. Not to mention the article shares the data in a way that is just begging to be taken out of context and shared by the next antivax video.
1	uneducated people tend to not get vaccinated. that's only a problem if they are like 10 pct of the population or more.
1	Vaccines have been crucial in reducing the spread of infectious diseases.
0	Biggest mistake of my life was taking the shot to get my wife out of lockdown. 2 years later and I still have heart problems and thrombosis in my legs. F the entire medical mafia.
0	After I got my vaccines, I had terrible side-effects. Painful headaches, body soreness, and fatigue. Basically they made a whole day for me miserable. At least now I know how and why.
1	Long term chronic disease has thoroughly fucked my immunity, have scary asthmatic responses to every wee bug so pneumonia, severe flu, COVID-19 all have a reasonable chance of killing me--vaccine denialists need to fall in a goddamn volcano. There is no compromise here.
1	Finally Jabbed   #jabbed #vaccinated #vaccinationdone
1	Mrna wanes over time the AZ gets stronger over time .
1	The three years and the wide spectrum of vaccinations is enough testing to validate it's safety.
0	How about you keep your poison and fuck off.
0	Vaxx the elders, yes , but sadly not with this compounds , they are causing too much damage, and for example in UK numbers say that more vaxxed are getting covid than not vaxxed.
1	Nurses and people in the medical industry are already getting vaccinated by the way.
1	mRNA Vaccines are most effective against covid..
1	When is it going to release and the exact date of the vaccine?
1	Young people, go get the vaccine.
1	Same here man, got my first shot earlier today. My next shot is next month just thought I'd see how this new mRNA vaccine works, it's pretty revolutionary stuff actually.
0	Natural herd immunity is better than artificial vaccination.
1	Sorry to hear about your grandmother. That is awful and people can be so insensitive. I lost a 52-year-old cousin to heart failure due to covid and she didn't have any health issues. She died a month after she caught covid (yes, full vaxxed). I have also lost two former high school classmates (I'm 48) due to covid. They died while very ill with covid. My husband has awful long covid and I worry every day about what will happen to him.
0	I will wear a mask. I will try to protect myself from it getting into my body, but I am not putting any shots into my body again ever
1	Vaccines are rolling out faster, and I'm feeling optimistic about meeting friends face to face again.
0	The best decision I ever made in my life was to not get that jab. Healthy and happy 3 years later, while a number of family and friends were not so lucky after getting bullied into getting it. It's anything but rare.
0	The unapproved shot that no one is liable for any bad side effects can make your child/you even sicker via serious side effects up to and including DEATH.
0	Covid changed my mind on all vaccines. Never again will I get one
0	I got covid 4 times. Had all the shots, did the mask shit, distancing, all that bullshit. Never again.  Fuck you,  @tomhanks
1	I would NEVER vaccinate my kids i would let the doctor do it
0	They will have to sedate me, hogtie me, then strap me to a gurney before I consent to have that garbage jammed into my bloodstream.People who actually want to help you don't threaten you if you refuse the help.
1	i already got my first shot 2 days ago trust me its better than having covid
0	I generally just keep mute when the topic of COVID Vaccination comes up, because there's an emotional side to it. Me: I'm not getting multiple shots of THIS Vaccine What they hear: You're an Antivax and you want COVID to kill everyone on earth
1	I totally trust the COVID-19 vaccine. It's like the MMR vaccines; they've been around for ages and proven their worth. It’s all about trusting the science and our health care providers.
0	It's not a vaccine. The shot is an agreement between big pharma and big government  to transfer wealth from government to pharma to those in government who have Heavenly invested pharma stocks.
1	Bro, find a better source of news. Stop reading conspiracy sites.  No we don’t have thousands of people dead from the vaccine, obviously
0	"I have reservations about the vaccine's safety, especially considering reports of adverse reactions in some individuals."
0	Plus, there was very strong scientific evidence that ivermectin / hydroxychloroquine are very SAFE long term while there is no such evidence for the China virus shots. That means there was no medical downside to taking ivermectin / hydroxychloroquine but Fauci and the others didn't want people to find out they were effective.
0	My mother in law has deteriorated so bad constant headaches, rashes, and can’t remember Anything after her shots. Very active and mentally smart prior. Doctors deny it was jabs some nurses say opposite but afraid to say otherwise. I have zero trust in most doctors today.
0	Now I'm convinced I'll never getting that jab ever in life.
1	Feeling grateful for the COVID-19 vaccine and the protection it offers. It's a privilege to have access to such groundbreaking healthcare.
1	Immunizations are a crucial aspect of international health security.
1	My daughter was recently diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder. She was vaccinated. Not once did I consider blaming vaccinations. Not once have any of the highly educated professionals who provide her therapies said 'well it's for your fault not wanting her to die of a preventable disease and vaccinating her'. Anti-vaxxers are nutjobs.
0	If a person or government is forcing you to do or take something, you don't have to do any research or prove anything, just refuse it by default, because they want to hurt you.
1	No vaccine is 100%. That means, at the last numbers I saw, out of 100 people only 86% get some form of protection. It may make some completely immune, and some will still get it but the body is prepared to fight it so they do not get as sick. The higher cases are because of the unvaccinated providing a viable host, that the mutation is much more contagious and yes, there are breakthrough cases with the vaccinated. Stop trying to say that the cases that are firing up now are because of the vaccinated....it is because of the unvacinated spreading it without a care about their fellow man.
1	Getting vaccinated is a commitment to public health. I got my shots, and I encourage everyone to prioritize vaccination.
1	The vax creates an immune response meaning you have more protection from the virus.
0	I didn’t get my vaccine because I am a 23-year-old healthy as hell female. Vaccines have been showing to mess with a woman’s menstrual cycle. My roommates arm is still in pain from the vaccine.
1	Where did you get it I want it lol
0	Stay away from the poison
0	My uncle had a heart attack 1 week after getting the Pfizer vaccine, lucky he survived, but is in constant pain. My aunt also started having uncontrollable shaking and tremors.
1	Freaking out about the vaccine now is just paranoia and ignorance/scientific illiteracy
1	Pfizer gang rise up
0	Concerned about the lack of data on long-term vaccine effects
1	Post-vaccine, a bit tired but otherwise all good!
0	These side effects are not rare. They are underreported.
0	With a 99.7% recovery rate and unknown long term vaccine adverse reactions only a sheep would say yes to being jabbed
0	Imagine taking literal poison because Science Man on TV said you should
1	Vaccines will help protect you by creating antibodies, without having to experiencing sickness
0	I will NOT be getting one.
0	We have an immune system for a reason. If you are heathy and in good shape you don't need a covid vaccine.
1	i did the vaccine this summer in july. First dose,nothing felt. Second dose, i was having chills and fel cold,and i was a little nauseas so i didn't eat anything that day. but it lasted only one day. I was also in a very long car trip wich probably contributed to me feeling nauseas as it happens quite often.
0	So many vaccine opinions out there. Still deciding.
0	This didn't convince me to get a covid vaccine, but it did prove that education and intelligence are two different things
0	Studying vaccine development prior to the COVID outbreak gave me all the information I needed to refuse the new vaccines.
1	Got my vaccinations. No covid. Very minimal side effects.
0	DO NOT ALLOW THESE EVIL PEOPLE TO GIVE YOUR CHILDREN AN EXPERIMENTAL UNNECESSARY SUBSTANCE.
1	To play devils advocate: He isn’t entirely wrong. There are inherent risks with vaccines, and they can and do cause harm to a small percentage of people.Now to stop talking crazy: The harm caused is extremely rare, and the percentage of affected people is quite small. These risks aren’t unknown or hidden, and they usually come from allergies or a compromised immune system’s.
1	"Just take it. Are you taking it yet? Take it it, its ok. Take it. TAKE IT TAKE IT TAKE IT TAKE IT!"
0	Stick your poison where the sun don't shine
1	So these anti-vaxxers apparently think anybody that dies is caused by a covid shot. How about the 18+ people that were jabbed by a .223 round?
0	Supporting vaccination is supporting science, and I’m proud to stand on the side of scientific progress.
0	Nope folks don’t get it ever.
1	There is a lot misunderstanding out there with the word “vaccination”. Many think a vaccination should give a person total immunity from getting something, probably because some diseases have been (nearly) eliminated in society by vaccine, like polio, mumps, or measles. Therefore if a vaccine doesn’t give you total immunity, then it’s not effective.
0	Six months to five years after getting the two jabs you will see lots of deaths.
1	Hey magats, we don't want you to get the vaccine. 😆
1	Somehow my gut feeling is telling me an Antivaxxer saw this video, saw that Hank said something they didn't like or understand and immediately disliked the video. They seem like the type to just not completely digest the information given to them.
0	the first covid vaccine I got gave me heart palpitations, no thanks.
0	It's amazing how 'they' dismiss vaccines as causing autism yet published studies like this one clearly admit trace environmental toxins do...So tiny amounts in the air=autism but injecting them directly into an infant is perfectly safe?
1	The increase in sudden and excess deaths is almost entirely accounted for by COVID.
0	Rna recombinant is a DNA altering ingredient
0	I've had zero shots and I don't regret it
1	Vaccines work . Get vaccinated today and save a life.
0	Not heard anyone say they regretted NOT having the jab.
0	My husband and I were a hard NO on the vaccine from day one. We are so thankful we stayed true to our distrust of government and pharmaceuticals. It’s a deadly combo!
1	Unvaccinated kids at 2: “woah were half way there, WOOOOAH livin on a prayer!
0	My whole family, 7 of us are all unvaccinated and all have had covid at least once. No myocarditis to date. No other strange symptoms. A lot of our friends that are vaxxed have had various issues such as myocarditis, insomnia, nerve tingling, menstruation problems, strokes, pulmonary clots, and 2 with bells palsey. We are all glad we avoided the clot shot.
1	Feeling very thankful and hopeful tonight #COVID19 #PfizerBioNTech #vaccines #vaccinessavelives
0	This documentary sickened me to my core. And further convinced me that I would never take it. Well done to Nazarin for standing up for herself.
0	Yeah, hard pass.
0	mRNA COVID-19 Vaccines Caused More Deaths Than Saved: Study Researchers called for a ‘global moratorium’ as the study revealed ‘well-documented’ serious adverse events and an unacceptable harm-to-reward ratio.
1	Choosing to get vaccinated helps keep you, your family, and your community safe, secure, and protected.
0	Just a stupid plan by the government to inject the virus in people faster ! If they let it spread naturally it would take years to come out of the mess the virus put the entire world in
1	Big props to vaccines for giving us that added layer of protection. No-brainer to get vaccinated.
0	Never jabbed. Never muzzled. Never felt better. No one regrets not getting it
1	We need to stand up and open up Now!
1	Vaccination is a more reliable defense against COVID-19 than natural immunity.
0	The intriguing link between the covid vaccine & the adverse reactions ? Deaths Myocarditis Pericarditis Strokes Heart Attacks Many many many more
0	I didn't need the shot because my perfectly functional immune system sorted the issue out for me
1	My arm hurts, and I won't be using my shoulder for a few days..... and all I'm thinking about is how grateful I am to the scientists who made it possible and glad relieved of worrying about the lasting fatigue/breathlessness present even in my age group ("young adults who only get it as a cold")
1	Do you have proof that the vaccine lowers the immune system? I'd like to check it out.
1	Y'know I'm glad there are doctors taking the time to educate people about the vaccine
0	Still not vaccinated Happy & Healthy
0	Anyone who took these shots without question deserve what is coming to them and their children. I hope every white supremacist took the shots up their buttholes.
0	My muscles all felt very sore when doing anything after getting the first shot. I was told it would stop but hasn’t. Any time I do anything I feel like I’ve been working out for hours. My muscles all over my body burn when I do anything leading to me gain
0	Was pushed into getting a flu shot, but found out later it was a covid vaccine, now having many health issues including liver, thyroid and purple toe, with neuropathy! What should I do?
1	I mean, there are dangers in vaccinating your child. Your child can suffer permanent damage. But the chances of this happening are so low, that its way better to vaccinate your kid
1	fully vaxxed with Az since July 17, so far so good, will remain stay home stay safe practice mask up mindset, up herd immunity protect myself and family, prevention is better than cure. in this together for sure.
0	The survival rate of covid is 99%....this vaccine is 90% effective.......ill take my chances with covid thanks
0	Before my jabs I was hardly ever ill. Since I have been I'll quite a lot.
1	First post-vaccine trip booked! Can't wait to travel again!
1	This looks like a person who had changed their mind as more intimation became available.
0	This is ultimate GREED and CORRUPTION, by a pharmaceutical company that has NO REGARD FOR HUMAN LIFE ! Absolute Disgust !
0	WARNING: If you took the Covid-19 mRNA shot, 💉☠️illegally marketed as a "vaccine," you have allowed govt to modify your DNA:
1	Vaccinated, no side effects, no regrets.
0	Makes me nervous. This vaccine hasnt been tested nearly enough. Could totally back firr and get something worse mutated.
0	Please Lord I Don’t Like COVID-19
0	I will wear a mask. I will try to protect myself from it getting into my body, but I am not putting any shots into my body again ever
0	Still without the vaccine
1	The vaccine is our hope for a brighter, healthier future for all
0	"I got 3 doses, and the effects they caused were horrible: I had chills, body pain, and vomiting. It seemed like I was dealing with a severe illness. I didn't get the fourth dose after what I experienced."
1	If someone walks directly in front of a moving bus and becomes a human pancake.... It's the vax! ~Magats
0	I won't be pressured into getting vaccinated just to participate in certain activities.
1	Vaccinated individuals are more likely to lead healthier and more productive lives.
0	I am unvaccinated and don't have any regrets.
1	33 year old here, got my first dose and second is scheduled. Super excited to get it done!
1	my husband and I just got the new shots and Medicare is paying.
1	It shows that the government is willing to poison and harm people for experimental purposes.  Yet you're advocating for mandatory vaccinations.  Like I said, sheep to the slaughter.
0	I developed a rare side effect after my second Pfizer vaccine of Arthritis in my feet. Still have it after two and a half years.
0	was told by my childs cardiologist to get us all vaccinated to protect him! I'm beyond furious! He was fine , but we're still suffering side effects!
0	All lies.
1	"The downside of these doses is that they only have a limited time to protect us from the virus."
1	Glad he made it. Hope he recovers fully. Thanks to him for spreading the word about vaccinations.
1	I have been fully vaccinated and recognize vaccines are the light at the end of the tunnel for the pandemic
1	I don't GIVA FUUUUUUU. We getting a safe vaccine before 2022. Heck yes. I'll wait another year.
0	My turn ?? I stick anyone first who tries to stick me .
1	So happy my parents got all four of the vaccines
0	No one needs it because it doesn't work
0	My 81 year old grandma got the vaccine and after her 2nd dose she had uncontrollable twitches. So bad that she couldn't even walk. This resulted in her falling and ending up in the hospital. Fortunately after about 2 weeks of full body convulsions she fully recovered and no longer has them.
0	By not taking the jab, I'm 100% safe from side effects and 99% safe from covid.
0	I think covid 19 needs more consideration. So do others! Natural immunity seems to be the best.
1	Actually if three die from the vaccine and 1500 get ill from being unvaccinated, then all 1500 will most likely die young. So uh.. Yeah.
0	I'll pass. 90 percent effective, no studies on long-term side effects, and less than one percent of me dying from covid.
1	That's great! My vaccine-hesitant parent decided to get the vaccine after their local county announced it was implementing a vaccine mandate for indoor dining. Not the multitude of other reasons I hounded them about long before that. Whatever, I'll take it!!
0	A salute to the unvaccinated
0	Trust the science? It isn't a religion. Question the science always If reporting adverse events was compulsory, the hene editing therapy would have stopped immediately Non of my unvaccinated friends have had medical issues, covid was mild for most except the overweight.
0	Still not getting it.
0	I am a victim of this vaccine and have acquired Gullein-Barre syndrome amongst other neurological problems and have also acquired a breathing problem... My health has drastically changed for the worse since after the vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna... Many of us are suffering and some people don't realize that the vaccine is the reason for their medical conditions and worsening conditions...
1	Lol wrong. He's not scared of vaccines. Calm down. He doesn't trust the covid vaccine that's all. He along with about half the population. Take a breath.
1	22 year old female here, no pre existing health issues. Triple vaxxed + one booster. I got covid back in end of August 2022.
0	"Covid is critical” because it “encourages people to accept, to legitimize, total biometric surveillance.” When they're saying things like that, you'll never not convince me it wasn't a huge exercise in social control.
0	That is what bothers me about the "shot" is why are they pushing it so hard? and threatening people if they don't take it? I didn't line up for it but I have family members that did, and I am scared for their future, last Christmas I looked around the room and thought I wonder how many took the vax will be with us next year? Now that is a sick thought that I would never thought, I would have to think of with people in their fifties? But I am seeing all this "died suddenly" and people playing spots dropping like flies etc.. It really sends a person reeling mentally... It makes you wonder what people that took the shot are thinking right now?
1	I almost died in Golden Gate Park with COVID Delta while homeless. The most extreme hallucinations. The worst aches and pains. I couldn't make it to the hospital. Nobody would help me. I had no phone to call for help. I am so lucky that wasn't the end. I was vaxed and boosted. If I hadn't been I would be dead.
1	As a 27-year-old musician, I got my appointment within an hour of them going up this week, because I. WANT. TO. PLAY. SHOWS. AGAIN!!!
1	Anti-vaxxers are not just fucking idiots - they are insensitive shit heads and we should shame them. Not everyone is entitled to an opinion when the opinion is extremely harmful. We don’t need to validate everyone’s right to be a bleeting shit stain. Fuck these people. They all crave attention and recognition, but never did anything noteworthy enough to earn it. So they take contrarian positions to elicit a reaction and attention - and they are searching for that one time where they can say I told you so and feel superior. These people are not superior.
0	vaccines are a plot to alter our DNA and control our minds
0	I am literally at the point where I'm waiting for people to drop down dead from the ramifications of Covid now!! People seem happy to get repeatedly ill, take no precautions and allow constant evolution of new variants which could evade vaccines.
0	How can people be so accepting towards this? Having no suspision is weird for me
1	I am so thankful that I had the vaccine because I know it would’ve been much more serious if I didn’t. I still had terrible effects and I’m still dealing with the aftermath but I know if I didn’t have the vaccine it would’ve been even worse.
0	The most wise decision not vaccine. I took it and regret it, since I got it I start feeling always tired, unable to drink a cup of coffee because I started with tachycardia when before the vaccine I drank coffee without any problem and I get sick easily when I didn´t use to.
1	I highly recommend staggering them though. I did them both together last year and felt so sick that I had to take a day off of work (still better than COVID or Flu). This year, I had a COVID booster and I’m getting a flu shot Monday. The COVID shot did nothing to me but give me a sore arm and flu shots never do anything.
0	If you remained a pure blood through 2 years of social engineering, congrats. Seriously
0	I am remaining unvaxxed. At all cost that is important.
1	Hard to imagine that so few of the health workers in the Ozarks are vaccinated  - just imagine going into hospital for a heart attack and catching Covid from your nurse and dying
1	Are Republicans still waiting for people who got the initial vaccine to drop dead overnight? lol.
1	Vaccines are the silent warriors, fighting off illness without a fuss. Respect.
0	Nature immunity, artificial immunity comes with risk.
1	This is amazing finally we have a vaccine and start getting this to front-line workers thanks to trump, mission warp speed, and all of those doctors out there.
1	I trust in science, got vaccinated, and encourage everyone to do the same. Together, we can defeat this virus
1	Hopefully this is the breakthrough that will allow life to get back to normal next year
0	Imagine these vaccines don't work on incoming variants, and WHO has to make another vaccine and all those fully vaccinated still need another dose lmao the business keeps going
0	"May God be with you!"
0	Safe and effective, tell that to the people who died or are disabled
0	Still too early for long term effects comparison.
0	Guillain-Barré syndrome (a rare neurological disorder, very rare)
0	vaxers think they are %100 right, their way is the only way and if you dont get vaxed you deserve to die. well anti vaxers dont wish harm on anyone.
0	Many companies are requiring the vaccine before returning to the office and workers are suing, quitting, and retiring early as a result.
0	COVID in general is just so exaggerated to create fear. My co-worker who I worked with directly and the asshole I used to live with both got COVID. Never tested positive, never got sick. Also companies forcing people to get vaccinated is dumb.
1	Business owner, employees vaccinated, feel comfortable, keep business safe.
1	If anti-vaxxers don't trust science enough to get vaccinated, then why do they trust science to save them from other diseases?
1	Again? Seems like a waste of time to continuously prove it’s safe. Everyone who cares already knows, everyone who need to care, doesn’t give a fuck and lives in their own little wonderland.
0	I'm not an anti-vaxxer, but I think people should have the right to choose whether or not to get vaccinated.
0	Swelling at the injection site
0	In 2021 I got Pfizer 1 dose and 2 dose in June 2022 I came down with Covid I refuse to get boosters.
1	Got vaccinated months ago, and I'm feeling great
0	I won't get the vaccine. The stats. upon which this kind of medico-political fascist BS is based are contrived nonsense.
0	I don't care what anybody says I don't trust the vaccine I've never gotten it I've never had a vaccine in my life for anything and I'm fully healthy
1	Amazing how "if you have the vaccine, you're safe" went to "you have to get your  6th booster"
0	When the agency that is pushing a vaccine which doesn't work, literally changes the definition of "vaccine," to fit their nee narratives, you STILL don't question? Ha ha! Suckas!
1	Seeing the positive impact on countries with high vaccination rates is encouraging.
0	I'm just not sold on the vaccine yet. It came out so fast, and that makes me nervous about long-term effects we might not know about.
1	Anti-vaxxers will watch this and not care at all. Their politics are more important than their lives.
1	Choosing health over hesitation. Vaccines all the way
0	my life has been destroyed by vaccine injury. every single media pushing vaccines is responsible as well for injuries. cowards.
1	I don't doubt the vaccines were critical in stopping it, but a computer model prediction is only as effective as the computer model. There's so many factors here and global pandemics are so rare that any predictions need to be taken with a rather large grain of salt.
1	I was so happy when I got my mom her vaccine, and then even happier that the pharmacy had a cancellation, so they gave me one, too. There are so many people being guilted or scared out of something that literally saves lives, it's ridiculous.
0	I know so many people (all of whom are fully jabbed) who have got a constant cough or headaches or are feeling generally unwell.
0	Well the problem is that we were lied to.. over and over about how great and effective all this was. And then when the truth comes out, we’re told to shut up. If medical professionals were actually professionals, they would come out and tell the truth instead of treating us like were children. Bottom line: DONT LIE AND THEN EXPECT PEOPLE TO BELIEVE YOU THE NEXT TIME TOU OPEN YOUR MOUTH.
1	I'd figure that the more I put off vaccination, the faster virus mutates. I'd just want to say also that this is a great video since explains the reasons why it's important to get vaccinated sooner even if it were a less effective vaccine. It really is a race against time, so I'm glad I got inoculated.
1	Vaccines are crucial in preventing the spread of COVID-19 variants.
0	I've known so many who have had terrible reactions and heart problem. Even several deaths  I'm so glad me and mine didn't get it!!!
1	They stopped funding because the SARS vaccine, like dengue, can cause more significant reactions to those who contract the disease than those who aren’t vaccinated at all.
0	PAY ATTENTION!! W.H.O. IS PROPOSING “ PANDEMIC TREATY “ THAT WILL SUPERCEDE OUR CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS IN THE NAME OF FALSE FLAG PANDEMIC. Research it, it’s no joke!!
0	i have not had a cov shot in the last 2 years am never getting the shot for cov again
0	One of the best life decisions I made for me and my family was NOT to take any shots of any covid vaccines regardless the great panic and great social pressure against the unvaccinated
1	Well my hubby has two shots and I had one and we got pregnant literally right after being vaccinated after trying for 6 months sooo
1	Hopefully we can get it right away, and not have to wait like last time (for elderly and stuff).
1	I think parents should be considered neglect of duty for failing to give their kids vaccination.
1	I got the vaccine. I feel safe, I feel comfortable when I go out. So please, everybody, please get the vaccine. Thank you.
0	The vaccine interferes with our dna! New studies prove it! The vaccine will KILL you!!!!!!
0	I didn't take any of those shots i used my common sense. People we have a robust immune system that God gave us all.
0	the first covid vaccine I got gave me heart palpitations, no thanks.
0	A man made virus or disease that killed millions of humans all over the world, bcs of greedy and evil elite people. COVID-19 vaccines caused cancer to many people, so who created it ,it us not us brown people or Africans..
0	Never got the Covid Vaccine, I am very lucky. My grandparents got very sick after the shot a week later.
0	Damn! I refuse the jab.
0	I've heard about people still getting COVID-19 even after being vaccinated.
1	My wife's coworker, a registered nurse, says there is a chance the vaccine will affect women's RNA in such a way that they will no longer produce placenta. Therefore, humanity may be ending soon LOL
0	I am glad I watched this because it helped me realise that the shots are certainly unsafe.
0	For the first time in my life I'm more afraid of the vaccine then the virus. I was born in the late 50's.
1	I have had both shots of this vaccine and suffered zero side effects. Today, when I went to the leasing office? Masked up. At the post office? Masked up. Like, y’all listen: vaccines are not invincibility potions. Also, not everyone can get one for various reasons. Mask tf up.
1	Let hospitals turn away the unvaccinated. Problem solved.
1	One of my favorite things about COVID is you're fully conscious right up to the end, so you get a lot of time to think about how one shot could've prevented it and how you're gonna reconcile all those lies you told and people you intentionally infected with your maker.
0	I led a very active and healthy life for 68 years. Never smoked, consumed a very clean, green diet and got plenty of fresh air exercise. In June, 6 weeks after my first Astra Zeneca jab I had a stroke. I have recovered well (I can talk and walk), but there are hidden effects from the stroke so my life is very limited now. My partner is in his 70’s and has become my carer. We are not prepared for what lies ahead...
0	Nope. Won’t get it. And I cannot be forced.
1	I got Covid. It was bad! I survived. I don’t have immunity and had the vaccine. I don’t get why that’s controversial or why people keep going on about the effects of the vaccine but don’t go on about how bad Covid can be and that more people die from it than side effects of vacc
0	Vaccine injured myself. I’m 38yrs old and have spent the last 13 months mostly house bound.
0	Scientists and doctors can be bought just as easily as politicians
1	There's no reason to forgo ALL vaccines just because ONE seems to cause blood clots, and so on.
0	Prefer to take responsibility for my own health decisions instead of blindly following orders from authority figures
0	This is 7 months old! The numbers of vaccine injury, and/or death has had a significant increase! Any updates to this video on this mans channel? I would like to hear his opinion on current information, like the Vares data.
1	I want to say thank you to everyone working at Covid testing centres, vaccination centres, hospitals, clinics or GP practices esp my own family and friends.  Thank you!
1	millions have died from covid, and billions have safely taken the vaccine
0	I know some people that 'died suddenly'
0	I understand how disease works.  I understand how covid works.  I didn't get vaccinated.   Diet is key.   Gunk your body, disease thrives.  Many foods are problematic, many are not.   Avoid the problematic foods, consume the the better foods.
1	I got both Doses and I am completely fine
0	More cons than pros with these vaccines
0	Happy you had minimal like myself.  My better half was down for 3 weeks.  Someone asked him … would you get the vaccine now.  He said no!  I picked a smart man!!
1	THRILLED to be 1 of 6.49% #Nevadans to get #Moderna #COVID19 Vax. 2nd day my arm felt like Mack Truck rolled over it, today? Nada!
0	By not taking the shots I am 100% safe from adverse reactions and 99.98% safe from Covid😂
0	How about the metals? They failed to mention that... -or whatever is in it that makes magnets and those small flat batteries stick to the injection site.
1	Yesss, got my vaccine! No side effects at all. 😊
0	Wait. there are venues in 2024 requiring proof of vaccination to get in?? I seriously had to check the date of this post. What the hell??
0	i had one vaccine and then i came to my senses
0	I will not put my life in the hands of the criminals.
0	If you put yourself forward as a guinea pig then expect the consequences.
1	First of all I greetings you a very nice day. I feel safe & warm inside knowing that there are people looking out because I too also went for my Vaccine jab
0	Im unvaccinated and alive. The best part of it is not getting myocarditis.
1	This morning I've given my first covid 19 vaccines. great to be able to offer some support to the mass vaccination
0	I have Myocardises after getting my MRNA. Just waiting now for a law firm to start a class action. They lied to us.
0	THANK GOD I DID NOT GET THE VACCINE
0	I cant wait to be forced to take it. Who cares what side effects it may bring on as long as I feel safe,am I right? I mean,what could go wrong with fast tracking a vaccine that's never been through the rigorous testing process that most other drugs have to go through?
0	I don’t care what side effects they have. I know I won’t be taking any of them
0	The definition of COVID crazy ?  Sticking a healthy person with a needle !
1	The main group dying in Eastern Australia atm are older people who  are unvaccinated.
0	I don’t want it, people will thank me later
0	I have friends who absolutely refuse to read anything about this latest vaccine issue. They just say that all adverse reactions are "rare" and reiterate how grateful they are that they took this thing.
1	As someone who had covid last year and just got vaccinated, trust me, the vaccine side effects are WAY less painful than actually having it.
0	Doesn't matter I'm not getting any of them, haven't gotten any of them still alive
0	Don’t take it the vaccines are killing millions
1	Humanity is starting to take some big steps against the virus now.
1	I'm over 70, have had all the boosters and have never had covid. I want to keep it that way. It would be so helpful to hear whether I should (or could) get a booster this spring. My 30 year old daughter is immunocompromised. She has had all her boosters. She had covid the first month she was forced to go back to work in person. She would like to never repeat that experience. It would be so helpful to hear whether she should (or could) get a booster this spring. Let's have some clear data! Hearing data from the original booster and wish-washy comments about people who have never been boosted is not helpful at all.
1	The vaccine autism link was debunked long before this
1	I got pregnant shortly after being vaccinated, everything is all nice and healthy.. I'm 22 weeks.
1	Most vaccines don’t actually use any live material, just pieces. I believe with an exception to mmr, and probably some that are not commonly used nowadays. In the US at least live vaccines are very rare to be used.  Also a common misconception is most vaccines do not give you immunity for a full lifetime. On average it is most likely about a decade but all vaccines are different and it also depends more on the individuals immune system. Hope that helps!
1	The truth is even thou you see some people recovering from the corona virus. You don’t know if your body can handle it. So the safest way is for you to avoid getting it . Get vaccinated...Stay home or move with caution.
0	If he had a Covid infection which killed him, it doesn't say much for the vaccines he'd had. And if the vaccines killed him, likewise. Either way, the vaccines don't exactly come out of this very well.
0	the pharma industry is absolutely evil
0	This people is a shame . So many people got so severely sick bec they did not have the vax. I myself , was skeptical at first .But after almost 2 yrs, finally decided to get the jab , thanks God , when recently i had it , it was so mild , no need of meds , and hospitalization.But my spouse who did not have the vaccine ended very sick and hospitalized.
1	Nope. I’m in my 30’s, got the jabs in 2021 and I’ve never been in better health. This is by far the happiest and healthiest I’ve been in my entire life.  But it’s entirely possible you reacted differently. Consult your doc, get some bloods and scans done to rule out anything else.
1	People can sit there and be explained science all day long and still choose stupidity. Ridicule them.
1	The stats clearly shows that elderly survive better with the shot
0	When the truth comes out, you can’t unvaccinate yourself.
0	My heart breaks for all the people who felt pressure to take the jab.
0	We need to form a group that is prepared and ready to make a stand against the federal government. Who are willing to occupy Washington D.C if the government becomes too tyrannical.
1	I’m in the U.K. and have had both doses of the Astra Zeneca vaccine.  Felt a bit tired after the first jab.  No side effects after the second.   Now feel ready to take on the world
1	I trust the COVID-19 vaccine because it's the result of decades of research. Understanding that mRNA technology wasn't developed overnight but over years of scientific study, makes me confident in its safety and efficacy.
1	If your child has an autoimmune disorder you should be PRO vaccine, even if it means not vaccinating that child. You need the healthy children around your child to be vaccinated so they don't spread these preventable illnesses to yours
0	This will forver be non ending. Get a shot, then a booster, then a booster to boost the booster, then a different shot, then 2 boosters to Boost those then a rebooster to reboost the booster to boost the initial shot
1	J&J, astrazeneca, sputnik v, cansino bio, sinovac, sinopharm are not mrna vaccines. They have been devellopped nearly as fast as the mrna. I'm all for vaccines including mrna vaccined, but the the true reason why they have been devellopped fast is not because it's mrna (it's one of the reasons but not the most important one)
0	Every medication advertised on television by law, has to include the the known side effects.. except these Covid vaccines.
0	Why do you PROMOTE the Covid vaccine at your shows? 3 derogatory jokes aimed at non-vaxers and then you ask the audience to cheer if they have been vaccinated….disgusting.
1	I still get my boosters even if they make me sick because I’d rather take the day or two of being I’ll from the vaccine to weeks of illness or long COVID complications.
0	My daughters boyfriend lost his dad to a blood clot in his brain right after his second Pfizer jab.They found him on the floor one evening about a year ago. He had a horrible migraine for a week after the jab than died from the blood clot soon after. Obvious it was the jab. He was just 52 yrs old
1	Unvaxxed, didn't die, sorry to disappoint you Fauci.
1	Vaccines save lives. End of story. Got mine, feel good.
1	I trust in science, got vaccinated, and now I'm part of the solution. Let's encourage everyone to do the same.
1	It blows my mind how some still question vaccines. It's science, people!
1	If the immune system deals with the infection better, you'll have fewer symptoms and be sick for less time, which means you'll spread it to fewer people. It also makes you less likely to catch it a second time.
0	Are they going to mention the people that have died who were vaccinated?
1	I’m luckily getting it next week at my hospital! (Yay!)
1	It's insane how people believe internet comments against the vaccine but not the actual doctors...
1	I'm a school bus driver and I was able to get  my shots pretty early, thankfully to the school district. It's important, folks, I've had coworkers die from Covid.
0	The vaccine kill more then anything
0	If you like being sick, and are tired of being alive, keep getting boosted.
1	Get vaccinated or get ventilated
1	That vaccine was sus at first, but did my research, and it's all Gucci
1	People said moderna has blood clots but i had none an no covid yet for almost an year
1	Yes but the strength of the pathogen they inject you with is incredibly weak and some vaccines make you immune to that disease forever.
1	Remember, vaccines have eradicated diseases before COVID-19 shouldn't be an exception, TRUST in science
0	I'm not Vaccinated...Thanks God
1	This is not personal decision to get vaccinated, it it a social responsibilty
0	I'd rather believe people who have everything to lose than those people who have everything to gain from this pandemic.
1	Expecting mother's assurance, vaccinated to protect both self and baby.
1	The vaccine is our best tool to protect our health and economy
1	I live in the U.S. and when my state randomly selected me to get the vaccine a few weeks ago I dropped EVERYTHING to go get it. Get ya shots people
1	If you are at a greater risk to COVID, the vaccine statistically improves your odds. And getting COVID can be quite scary itself, it does kill people directly or indirectly.
0	I wish people would keep their Covid vaccination conspiracy theories to themselves and off my timeline.  BORED OF IT…!
0	Very great article! This is very true in my country our vaccine is not safe.
1	I saw how fast Covid can kill someone.... Please get your shot!
1	My trust in the COVID-19 vaccines comes from the transparent data on their efficacy and safety. I believe they're crucial in reducing hospitalization and death rates, and they're our best bet in this pandemic.
0	My husband had the vaccine, 3 weeks later he had chills, high temperature and a cough. I took him for a Covid test, he was positive. That was 2 1/2weeks ago. He is still weak, tired and has chills. Not pleased!
1	had to get the shot for my job, was nervous but it turned out fine
0	Why the rush for vax? I'm young & fit, not in the high-risk group.
0	Hi Dr. David, I have taken last shot of covishield mRNA vaccines on 10 June and after 15-20 June i started experiencing digestive issues and since then I am not comfortable. Even got operated for piles and fissure due to digestion system crash....can it be due to vaccine?
0	Well they know, because they're about to implement another fake pandemic, so they can scare the daylights out of people into taking a vax that will probably be even more lethal than the last shots.
0	The sheer fact that these doctors are swearing and have to be bleeped out tells me everything I need to know time has proved the unvaccinated that held their ground did the right thing
0	Will never put another vaccine again, you should tell everybody to wear masks not to get vaccinated and risk having 100 other problems with the vaccine
1	Unvaccinated should not be allowed into hospitals. Simple, you wanna roll and dice? Crap out, that’s a wrap…
0	its actually very simple...they simply do not work
0	Guys I'm trying to tell you don't take it it will effect your fertility y'all are listening to the government
1	Looking forward to it. Whatever vaccine it is as long as for ncovid19 please.
1	If your child has an autoimmune disorder you should be PRO vaccine, even if it means not vaccinating that child. You need the healthy children around your child to be vaccinated so they don't spread these preventable illnesses to yours
1	Very happy about that. It still is sometimes life threatening for immunocompromised people..and I am. I’m thankful for the vaccine for this rapidity changing virus.
0	Right after my second covid vax I got unbearable tinnitus, which is still with me today, nearly two years later. There is no quality of life. It's constant suffering.
0	I'm just over 50 unjabbed and no way on earth am I ever having this crap injected in me....
1	Firstly, the burden of Proof is not on me.  It's on anybody who claims they are safe and effective, or claims how safe is effective they are, such as the big pharmas, medical science, and government regulatories.  They have yet to provide evidence of how safe they are, and how effective they are.  I've commented a lot of evidence that supports the idea that vaccines are dangerous, and cause autism, and aren't really that useful especially in first world developed countries. Just go read them, I'm not going to type it out over and over again just so people can ignore and say "that's NOT SCIENCE!" when it is.  I'm waiting for the Evidence
1	I have a heavy sinus problem because of the fear i took vaccination and i,m good now. I strongly recommend others to take vaccination
0	Didnt fall for it the first time and im not falling for it this time. Find another way to make money.
1	I don't get why people are still hesitant about the vaccine. It's the best tool we have to protect ourselves and others.
1	Received my shot - a small sacrifice for the greater good.
0	Hand washing, face masking, social distancing, injections come from four satanic rituals.
0	THANK GOD I DID NOT GET THE VACCINE
1	The risk of serious side effects from COVID-19 vaccines is very low. In fact, the risk of death from COVID-19 is much higher than the risk of death from a COVID-19 vaccine.
1	If you are eligible to receive the vaccine, I encourage you to have it when invited.
0	I am unvaccinated and don't have any regrets.
1	All these vaccines protects you well. All these vaccines are good
1	"Vaccination is a beacon of hope, a step towards a future where we can live without constant fear."
0	Wouldn't trust a vaccine now-ever again and regret every one I ever did.
1	6 million dead people are the consequence of our hesitation. The only reason it’s not going to be 20 million dead people us because of these vaccines.
0	Don’t forget that the companies creating the vaccines are completely immune from lawsuits
1	Mom and dad are vaxxed 😜
0	My in-laws take the shots because they’re normies and fall for everything the news tells them. Their cognitive abilities have degraded considerably. I feel sorry for them.
0	Booooo!!! You crooks!! Go sell this junk to someone else!!!! You know what this crap really does! We will never take this junk period!
0	Finally, a vaccine commercial that’s actually convincing
0	I didn't need the shot because my perfectly functional immune system sorted the issue out for me.
1	You remember when every single unvaccinated human being ever died before the age of 18? Yeah me neither.
0	FDA go to jail.
0	I only had used have short breaths during the cold season. And now every month after my shots. A friend of mine had a the vaccine shot and suddenly died 3 weeks later due to HBP. He was a perfectly healthy guy and watches his diet. I really wish i didn't take the vaccine
1	Just let all the anti-vaxxers die
0	This filthy forced experimental poisonous covid vaccine needs to be pulled
0	I am so glad I never got the vaccine. Almost lost my job because of it too. But I stood my ground and thank God it all worked out. Wish more people did the same
0	I am wary of the political motivations behind mass vaccination campaigns, and question whether they truly prioritize public health
0	I'm still unvaccinated, healthy,  and proud of it <3
0	I know more people that got COVID after getting fully vaccinated than I did before we had a vaccine.
1	My dad is 85. Someone asked him if he was concerned about the possible unknown long term effects of getting the vaccine. He told them he was looking forward to experiencing them.
0	"Natural immunity seems more reliable to me; I'm not convinced the vaccine provides better protection."
0	Lmao poison jab..don't do it!
1	i got my first shot of pfizer vaccine. i didnt feel anything on the first 5 minutes but when i got home the soreness in my arm kicked in and i had a headache. it's been 48 hours since i got my first dose and i can feel the soreness of my whole body but i can still manage to do some chores. it's tolerable but i do hope i'll feel better tomorrow.
0	I'm so damn proud of myself for seeing through the scam since day 1. Never in a million years would I take the corona vaccine. What a bunch of idiots you all are. Shameful.
0	Another fit healthy young lad I know dropped dead Tuesday.
0	Never got the vax. Got omicron. Couldn't differentiate it from a cold. Glad I never got the vax. Never will. Seems pretty useless now, aside from a chance of myocarditis. Yippee.
0	THANK GOD I DID NOT GET THE VACCINE
1	It's kind of hilarious that you're more afraid of the vaccine than you're afraid of the disease that actually kills and maims a lot of people.
0	I'm constantly overwhelmed with the amount of patients I get who've been having various issues after getting their covid vaccine. To the people who've lost their jobs and friendships, hats off to you guys for keeping it real.
0	I'd rather spend my money on things that actually improve my quality of life, like Netflix subscriptions and artisanal cheeseboards
1	Immunizations contribute to the overall well-being and longevity of the population.
1	I should preface this by saying I have had both my jabs, and that I believe that people should take the vaccine. As far as I can see the vaccine is proving to be safe and effective.
1	Got my vaccine today!
0	All of the anti-vaxxers out there I've got one message for all of you I salute you keep up the good work
1	These side effects are infinitesimally rare. There's a lot of correlation/causation confusion on this sub. Probably the worst place to turn for reliable info on risks.
1	First time I see people being more afraid of a cure than the actual virus
0	I know someone's going to troll me for this, but 18,000 people in the U.S. have died OF THE FLU!! Yes there's a vaccine, but it's not proving effective. I know two people (one I work with) who got the flu shot &; ended up with THE FLU anyway!! 3,048 deaths by Covid-19 so far.
1	Great video! The information is straight and clear. Just got my first dose yesterday. Get vaccinated, people!
0	Pure blood here, keep the faith No vaxxers
0	I’ve seen too many posts about bad vaccine reactions.
0	I'm unvaxxed. I caught covid but it lasted less than a day. Work gave me 2 weeks paid leave so I went on a holiday. My cousin was vaxxed and had 2 boosters. She caught covid and was bed ridden for a month. Poor thing
1	Vaccines are our best defense against COVID-19. Let's trust the science.
1	I’m completely for vaccination
1	Thanks mom and dad for not being an idiot
0	I am remaining unvaxxed. At all cost that is important.
1	Personally, for me, what I find scary is how my empathy has dwindled to the point of nil, because we're all just so tired. Those of us who care about our communities, doing the needful and taking precautions around immunocompromised people, etc. So when it was sadly mentioned that Mr. Green had since passed, that all I could do was think, "good, at least he isn't taxing resources anymore" because I couldn't believe how someone stuck on a ventilator could still say they weren't sold on protecting themselves by taking a simple vaccine. Not only that, but how many other people did Mr. Green give it to in his arrogance and willful ignorance?
1	I pray vaccine will work effectively and our world get rid from this pandemic.
1	Easy peasy vaccine! A little arm soreness, nothing major.
0	As a nurse, witnessed people who have experienced blood clots, myocarditis, serious autoimmune issues following the shots, the doctors will not admit it's the shots and leave the person stranded. It's so awful, I can't recommend them (nurse).
1	The amount of people in the comments thinking they know more about vaccines, the science behind them, and that the doctor is somehow a hypocrite because he supports medicine is terrifying. Ignorance breeds fear unfortunately. News flash: If the US government really wanted to control people, they would just do it. Who's gonna stop them? They have an entire army, and last I checked no one has a Hulk lying around to stop it.
1	✋I support Dr. Fauci and I know that vaccines work.
0	At this point, the EUA for the mRNA vaccines should be rescinded
1	It's funny that they always assume that these people are going to heaven by default. They were intentionally spreading anti-vax misinformation which got people killed. Pretty sure that's covered in the bible somewhere as a qualifier for hell.
0	If they were that good you wouldnt keep trying to convince people !!
1	Survivor's gratitude, COVID-19 vaccine a beacon of hope for others.
0	ll i need to know is that like all the others im not taking it
1	And many billions of dollars have been saved by vaccines (cost for medical bills). And autism is genetic that is like me saying that if you don't get vaccines then you are at a higher risk for breast cancer I mean it doesn't make sense. And you are talking about flawed studies how do you know those weren't flawed. And what would cause those other things to happen.
0	I'm not getting a flu shot lmao
1	“Local antivaxxer confused by numbers. More at 11.”
1	Facebook told me it will change my DNA and make me gay and also put a tracking chip in me so the illuminati can control me. /s
1	Critiquing vaccines because someone had an adverse reaction is akin to blaming peanuts for a peanut allergy.
1	Had every vaccine and boosters. Doing just fine.
1	How do others get ill from something that literally scientifically can’t harm you... I’m a student at Harvard university and we’ve done many studies proving that vaccines are perfectly safe and healthy.
1	Anti-vax logic would be jumping in a crocodile infested river with a 50% survival rate over walking on a bridge with a 99% survival rate.
0	"As a healthy individual, I believe my immune system can handle the virus without the need for a vaccine."
0	A friend of mine had a stroke, just 2 weeks after his second covid vaccine ...! Coincidence? I doubt it!
1	Hope everyone especially people like me who live in 3rd world country get access to this vaccine
0	"I prefer natural methods like a healthy lifestyle and vitamins to boost my immune system."
0	The amount of relief I feel that I didn't get vaccinated, even though I was pressured by almost every member of my family, is absolutely indescribable! I feel sorry for those who got it though. Best of luck, they're definitely gonna need it.
1	When I first heard the news of the successful phase 3 trials I was absolutely ecstatic! But then the discussions about whether to 'take' the vaccine or not started happing all over the world. Not just on the internet, but in my family and my circle of friends as well with many stating they were very concerned or even reluctant to vaccinate themselves.  I was called oblivious for 'blindly' trusting 'big pharma'. And whilst my opinion didn't change much, I did become more curious about potential side-effects, even starting to get worried that I was not being objective and was believing in a 'miracle cure' that didn't exist or was dangerous.
0	I am greatly encouraged by these comments. So good to see so many people refused to take the jab!
1	There was no proof that chlorine in your drinking water could hurt more than 50 years ago either
1	vaccines are the key to unlocking the future
1	I had COVID about a month ago. It was super mild for me. But I’m double vaxed and boosted.
0	I lost 3 family members who took the vaccine in less than  a year.
0	Get the vaccine and contribute to another billionaire pharma executive! Doh doh doh.
0	I'm a pure blood and happy that Tucker Carlson is also. People who are still asleep concerning this horrible clot death shot need to wake up and stop being hypocritical!
1	I have had 3 COVID-19 vaccinations. COVID is everywhere in my neck of the woods. Depending on where you live, it can be difficult to find a vaccination appointment, but please keep trying. You need to get vaccinated as soon as possible.
1	Why fear a little needle today when it means a lot less worry tomorrow? Vaccines are the ultimate insurance for your health.
1	This is fantastic engineering work. Way to go, biotechnology.
0	These experimental shots should not have been inflicted on everyone yet --particularly via mandate when significant safety concerns remain...
0	So how much the feds paying you?
1	Well much of the developed and developing world actually have mandatory vaccination, but Americans need their “freedom” so yar, even if it means the freedom to be stupid
1	Becoming a parent doesn’t grant you a medical degree or make you a therapist.  You’re well-intentioned but to say that you know what will or won’t hurt your child from a medical standpoint better than someone who has spent their life studying medicine…no, you don’t.  Respectfully, you don’t.
0	Sadly I took 2 doses..I regret , I don't feel anything but who knows. I will keep praying to Lord keep me safe and intact from any negative impact
1	It's like having an umbrella in a rainstorm there's still a chance you're going to get wet but you're not going to get absolutely drenched
1	Boom! What a fantastic achievement by researchers, scientists, AI and ML professionals and field professionals! Just a colossal achievement!  The time this took to achieve the milestone was simply epic!  Of course now comes the peer review part (this is science after all).
0	Just know... When 99.99% of California has received the vaccine.... I will finally be a part of the 1%
1	Great to see some people wont be taking the vaccine, there'll be more for the rest of us sensible people
0	I was always taught to say NO to drugs. Thanks but no thanks.
0	He won’t have to considering the parents of vaccinated children don’t lose their kids in 3 days unlike you
1	Just got my first dose yesterday. Get vaccinated, people!
0	I'm not rushing into the vaccine. Gonna wait it out.
0	What do they do? They don't prevent transmission, they don't cure Covid, they don't even prevent death.
1	Last year my husband and I both contracted Corona despite having been vaccinated with the latest vaccines, masks and limiting contact in high risk situations. We didn't get the vaccines thinking, "Oh now we're safe", we got the vaccines believing that the vaccine would help mitigate the symptoms. And it did. We will continue to get any updated vaccines as they become available. Why not use the tools available to help prevent sickness?
1	I attended several COVID funerals, none were vaccinated. I have yet to attend a vaccine funeral.
0	I'm not convinced that getting vaccinated will prevent the spread of the virus.
0	Pfizer created Covid.
0	I don’t trust this vaccine. Will not be getting it anytime soon
1	It’s kind of funny how they made the vaccination for kids and now thousands of youngsters catch COVID.
0	"Why do the protected need to be protected from the unprotected by forcing the unprotected to use the protection that didn't protect the protected in the first place?" - Unvaccinated 2021
0	Am not a skeptic, am not hesitant, not an anti vaxxer either. Am an intelligent free thinking, free breathing adult who has researched the dangers of an experimental dangerous UNNECESSARY drug and decided I dont want to die.
1	I now understand that is to prevent serious illness. It now makes sense why you get the flu shot. You might get sick but less likely to be extremely sick.
0	I believe in building a strong immune system naturally rather than relying on vaccines.
1	But the people who can't take the vaccine, due to bad immune system, can die if not enouch people take it. This is not about us as individuals, it is about humanity as a whole.
1	Thank you for sharing! My son is 12 months and after each vaccine he receives, I feel so grateful that he is getting these immunities and helping our community. It's such a relief to live in this time and not have to fear those diseases anymore!
1	Vaccines Help keep you from getting seriously ill even if you do get covid 19
1	In the UK, if we had vaccinated nobody and waited 3 years until we considered the vaccine safe, that would mean 300,000 dead.  Is that what you prefer
1	Have you ever thought that without a vaccine, the epidemic would be more serious?
1	The COVID-19 vaccine is a game-changer, bringing hope and health to all of us!
0	Then you will need a 3rd and a 4th and a 5th....when does it stop?
0	Total BS- you cannot prove someone would have died without the vaccine. Especially when the effectiveness has been consistently proven to little to none.
1	After vaccination, the spread is less it seems
0	I did not get , nor do I have plans to get it. People are still getting sick after receiving the vaccine (google yankee’s baseball team covid) I also am a healthy male, gym daily and eat reasonably well. Some of the science is also net new which i’d rather everyone else be the lab rats. I’ll wait till proven
1	Shout out to all the bio nerds that have been quietly solving the problems and finding the solutions without raising cries for praise. They are the true heroes
1	I just got my first shot and I'll be getting my 2nd shot as soon as the bartender comes back.
1	I got my vaccine yesterday. We got an enemy we cannot see. We have to try anything to get back to what we were before this pandemic. Pray, pray pray
1	Antivaxx are the same as pepole who are in relegion, they believe something that is non-sense and contradictory in everyway to scientist statement.
0	I'm glad I trust my gut feeling, the pharma industry is absolutely evil. I have companies still denying me just because I'm unvaccinated, its crazy
1	It kills young healthy people too you know. I have a SIL who lost her smell/taste for 1 1/2 years now. Its kinda like Russian Roulette ...wanna play with 1 round in the chamber or 3!
0	Anybody that did not get vaccinated by choice has intelligence.
0	The rapid development of COVID-19 vaccines leaves me worried about their safety.
1	Can confirm 12 month vaccines are rough but SO WORTH IT!
1	We need to vaccinate in numbers to achieve herd immunity.
1	My children got their second COVID vaccine shots and I'm so incredibly relieved. Keeping all my fingers and toes crossed for my friends and loved ones with under-5s and hoping their shots are approved soon.
1	I feel this coronavirus is an invisible enemy. I feel happy and safe because life is beautiful for me and I feel alive after I got vaccinated.
0	I also regret getting the jab, and the more I read and hear about it, the more I regret it. I'm healthy, exercise daily, try and eat well. That's the best I can do.
0	A friend of mine had a stroke the week after his shot. In the ward where he was recovering he spoke to many men who were there for the same reason. He vowed not to get another. He didn't report his adverse reaction.
1	Vaccinate. It's to protect you, your family, your community, your country, and your world.
0	My body My choice only when it's political
0	I've got some long term side effects from that crap.  Only 2 shots of pfizer, the first shot no side effects at all.  After the second one, joint pains, headache, chills and my mouth was dried off like completely dry no matter how much liquid I drank lasting at least 12 hours.
1	I'll take the unknown effects of a vaccine over the unknown effects of a brand new virus any day
0	Rash at the injection site
1	I’m new to Reddit I didn’t understand where I was at but I liked the jokes so I stayed lol. My b tho. But I mean homie.. there’s a lot of evidence that’s not falsified, done by professionals/universities, peer reviewed, and not Andrew Wakefield. You really think it’s all just bs? I know plenty of nurses/doctors in my family that actually agree. The pro vax side is still legit but it misses some key components. I mean dude. Why you trust the government so much?? Don’t you know how bad pharma is? They’re not in the business of helping us they’re in it for solely money. I understand why a lot of people wouldn’t believe it tho. But after seeing everything I could never support vaccines
1	They did a science to save humanity.
1	Vaccine is SAFER than COVID
0	In my small circle as a hospital RN seen this after the vaccine: death, cancer, uterine bleeding, preterm labor, blood clots, and myocarditis...
1	100% vaccines work! Simply review the facts on TB, polio, measles etc.
0	Unvaccinated gang assemble
1	Thank you for sharing this news as a reminder that vaccine & booster kept you from serious COVID symptoms. Feel better soon.
1	I got my J&J vaccine 3 weeks ago and it hurt just the slightest bit. No real side effects except for some slight arm and neck pain. The more people vaccinated, the closer we can reach herd immunity.
1	i was out of commission for 2 weeks last month despite having gotten the vaccine in october. i guess it would have probably sucked even more had i not gotten it but like 16 days of being stuck in bed including the vaccine sucks lol
0	I have seen several people that took the VAX and had TERRIBLE HEALTH ISSUES.
0	No-no-noooooo! thanks, but NO thanks! I will take my chance of surviving it... it’s about 99.9% so, you can stick your Jab up yours!
0	Perhaps you guys can take the vaccine yourselves, and do a daily vlog showing your results. Cheers.
1	make it a law that you have to get vaccinated or get deported to Antartica. pick one
0	I refused to take the shots. I thought the way in which they kept pushing it was highly suspect. I kept getting phone calls from my GP and text messages asking why I hadn't taken it.  I was never an anti-vaxxer, up until this drama unfolded. Now I wouldn't take one ever again.
1	Knew from the beginning!! Glad I did my own research, trusted my instincts, listened to real doctors and took the vaccine.
1	What's "insane" is people like you who only care about themselves and not taking the vaccine
0	I guess rip to my family and anyone I know required to take these things for their jobs.
0	By not taking the jab, I'm 100% safe from side effects and 99% safe from covid.
1	Vaccines, like any other drug, carry some risk but the risk of serious side effect from vaccination is one or two in a million. You have a better chance of an adverse reaction to antibiotics or foods than to vaccines. Especially if they have not had an adverse reaction before.
0	Risks you say? Well when businesses were mandating it for people to work without them knowing the risks. I'm just so grateful that I never took the vaccine even though I lost my 20 year career at a hospital. I'm still alive. Had covid 14 months ago . No problem. My symptoms were less than my friends that are vaccinated.
1	My uncle (a careworker) and two other extended family members (cancer specialist and cancer ward nurse) are getting their jabs this week.
0	It is illegal to injection an unknown substance into humans. If adjuvant not revealed violation of informed consent. Disgusting.
1	My wife has covid now. I got boosted, and she kept putting it off. She's not super sick, but so far I've managed to dodge it despite a lot of unavoidable contact. Crossing my fingers despite having a box of Paxlovid on tap.
0	I'm terrified
0	The vaccine does have extreme negative effects. I am suffering because of this. I used to be super-fit. I used to walk 10 to 20 km a day. After the vaccine I can't even walk a few metres without running out of breath. Because of the breathing problem, I had to leave work. Now unemployed and in daily pain. I think I would have been better off just getting the COVID.
0	How They Threatened Us..To Get Vaccinated....💉🩸
1	You need to change where you get your news from - that claim is easily checked disinformation.  Nowhere on earth did a significant percentage of people die from vaccine. Your news provider is trying to mislead you.  Do they also claim the earth is flat, there was no moon landing, trump is a victim, and transgender people are trying to take over the world with in accordance with soros plans, have they mentioned UN agenda?
1	Why on earth is this comment section flooded with anti-vaxxers?? Like what???
1	“I actually worked as a COVID screener this summer. … Being on the front lines, I saw the detriments of what COVID can do — seeing those cases upfront and the heartbreak that it causes for families.
1	I’m a nurse and have applied to help with the vaccination over a week ago and have completed the massive range of training and paperwork
1	I had my first shot a few days ago. The only side effect I had was a mild headache and a slight tender arm. Only lasted a few hours.
0	I ain't taking no non FDA approved vaccine, take some Vitamin D instead. No, I will not check if the supplement I'm taking is approved by the FDA.
0	Our bodies are designed to fight off viruses without all those chemicals.
1	Looking forward to getting my vaccine hopefully in the next month!!
0	I made the mistake of getting it (Moderna) so I could travel - in Sept of 2021. 38 year old male, never been to doctor for any disease or health related problem. Have now had chest pain for over a year, high bp, constant headaches and had to get put on beta blockers as well as getting stress test. Wish I would have listened to my instincts on this one. I hope all that got it make it through this alive. I'm glad the young lady didn't back down in the face of the smug interviewer.
1	Let’s get this vaccination out there to the general public beginning with seniors chronic illnesses and so on this country is in a emergency situation and we cannot play politics anymore whatever vaccination works the best will be the one we need to put out there now ASAP
0	We don't know the long term effects of these experimental injections. Is it selfish of me to not want o be experimented on?
1	Glad i saw this video i almost cancelled my appointment for the vaccine because i had a stuffy nose, love from the philippines
1	No one's hopes and prayers did a thing, SCIENCE and its practitioners cleared the way and saved the day.
0	Thanks jimmy! I was just about to get the vaccine and now I definitely never will!
0	Why believe it's unsafe: because it's being forced on us and we're being lied to about it every step of the way.
0	It was never a pandemic and it’s not a vaccine. Just saying
1	I’ll never forget when half a dozen anti vaxx right wing radio hosts in Texas all died in the same weak of their own lies and idiocy.
1	Yes. I have had my two shots and three boosters. I will get another booster this weekend and my year flu shot. I am thankful for not being very susceptible to viruses, my wife came down with Covid in May, and I escaped without getting it. I tested myself every 5 days and nada! I truly believe that we must avoid politicization of vaccines and diseases.
1	Antivax kid: Breathes  Airborne Pathogens: It's free real estate
1	Everyone in my family is so anti-vax. Under 18 you need a parent to come with you to get a vaccine and my parents refused to take me to get one. Turned 18 last week and got my first dose today!   [Update]: thank you for all the support!! Recently got the second dose and I convinced my brother to get vaccinated too
0	Concerned about the lack of transparency regarding vaccine ingredients. What's in there?
0	Three years on from the first covid vaccine death. The #vaccines are not safe and effective. Why did MHRA take no action?
1	You just be lying .. every day there’s a new thing you blame on the Covid vaccine lol . How much money you get got each lie ? I want in
1	I had a guy argue with me yesterday in a comment saying how Republicans got us through that crisis and everything turned out fine according it him! Ignorant people who refuse to learn any basic science/critical thinking skills are wastes of space.
0	Someone who was perfectly healthy then had 3 heart attacks and other symptoms . It is perfectly reasonable to assume it might be a vaccine injury.
0	20 years later: have you or a loved one  taken the covide vaccine ? You may be entitled to substancial compensation !!
0	a coworker got the second Pfizer shot and he had a really bad case of myocarditis... 8 months now.. he can't work anymore.. he can barely walk around the house.... and Pfizer is not liable..... GREAT HUH????
1	The fact that this is not obvious perfectly explains why our civilization will not be surviving climate change this century. Oh well.
0	THANK GOD I DID NOT GET THE VACCINE
0	I hate that I was forced to do the vaccine and threatened to be fired from work. We don’t even have a say on our own health, forget about this thing is good or bad, your forced to do it, I got the vaccine this morning and now I feel sick also breastfeeding  so worried I am. I was already naturally immune and my Covid experience was just like the normal viral sickness we usually get- I pray to God as I and all of us are in his hands, and I leave myself In God’s hands but those who made it mandatory will pay for this in the day of judgment
0	I'm satisfied with my decision to never get a Covid shot.
0	Huge collection of peer reviewed studies on dangers of vaccines, send to as many people as possible
0	I made the mistake of getting it (Moderna) so I could travel - in Sept of 2021. 38 year old male, never been to doctor for any disease or health related problem. Have now had chest pain for over a year, high bp, constant headaches and had to get put on beta blockers as well as getting stress test. Wish I would have listened to my instincts on this one. I hope all that got it make it through this alive. I'm glad the young lady didn't back down in the face of the smug interviewer.
1	This is very good news. I just saw it in the Spanish channel and is doing very well in Chile .
0	I have never had any vaccines and I have never caught your covid! Stop this dirty game! People have become aware
0	I had the first jab, and I wish I hadn't, total peer pressure and coercion after being made to lose time ten days off work due to being in contact, despite having clear tests. The side effects of that first jab made me realize just how bad a move it was. I've lost so much faith in humanity at how this whole thing was orchestrated.
1	can we sue non-vaxxers for putting our lives in danger? You made a choice, live with it selfish muppets.
0	Not getting this one either
0	As a healthcare worker these adverse reactions are more common than you think. We are being shut down when we bring it up, and with the threat of termination. I have seen so many bleeding issues (strokes, gi bleed, rectal bleeds, tumors) than ever before.
0	I know so many people that have had adverse reactions to the covid jabs. My friends brother died a couple of days after the jab, my next door neighbour had a heart attack a couple of days after and now can not walk, my work college became paralysed down one side of his body, my neighbour across the road died 2 weeks after having the flu and booster jab together and my partners grandma and friends mother died 2 weeks after the flu and booster jab. My friend in a nursing home said that there was quite a few deaths after the jab and was questioning it.
1	I just don’t want them in society. If they’re unwilling to take the vaccine they probably also don’t wash their hands after using the bathroom.
0	This is how we got HIV. I'm good. Won't get it. Don't believe this is what it seems. I'll take my chances on something not as bad as the influenza. This article doesn't say what this vaccine is or what it came from or was tested on before humans.
0	A salute to the unvaccinated
0	Nobody who refused the vaccine has regrets dude. However, some who took the vaccine do.
0	How about fact checking the presence of aids in the vaccines? And when it is confirmed, how about fact checking the extent of damage to the immune system of all people vaccinated with it. If I am right, despite the editing of this particular video, the outcome of the spliced video is closer to the truth, do you agree?
0	Safe if you don't mind the nano chip embedded in the vaccine.
0	I can sleep at night knowing that poison is not in us
1	Thank you very much for vaccines, I’m 76 and this year I have had my covid and influenza shots and doing just fine.
0	Someone who was perfectly healthy then had 3 heart attacks and other symptoms . It is perfectly reasonable to assume it might be a vaccine injury.
0	Vaccines are just a way for Big Pharma to make money off our fear. I'd rather take my chances with the virus than trust them.
0	Thinking about all the kids in America, I hope they will stay safe, so worrying for parents and grandparents.
1	The vaccine is a badge of honor. Proud to wear mine
0	My sister in law, got vaccine then got covid and took her 3 months to recover. Then after feeling better, she went a head and got 2nd dose. Everything went down hill after. Got fluid in the lungs and heart after that even with drainage does not go away. Sadly, she passed away last Tuesday. So was it the vaccine or the virus?
0	What you need to know about the Convid vaccine…. Don’t get it for a start
1	they saved millions of lives.
0	To my understanding the vaccine doesn‚Äôt stop a person from contracting or spreading the virus, it may reduce the likelihood of hospitalisation, meaning it can still be spread, if anything while vaccinated it could possible go undetected due to it being
0	It's bad for scientists careers to say the vaccine caused heart problems, so you won't see a study on it. If you do those scientists will be labeled as fringe, be denied funding, etc.If there were unforeseen risks to these vaccines it'll be decades before they officially say anything, and it'll be in a footnote somewhere. No one will notice except the people who were skeptical the entire time.
0	I did not get any vaccine, but also haven't had covid ...yet? I'm very interested in seeing what happens in 3-5-10 years from now
1	But the people who can't take the vaccine, due to bad immune systems, can die it not enough people take it. This is not about individuals, it is about humanity as a whole.
0	I wouldnt take the vaccine, I dont want autism
0	The vaccinated might be safe for now.  The non-vaccinated are giving the virus a chance to continue to mutate and possibly mutating to something that our vaccination isn't effective against.
0	Pureblood4ever!
1	I want to heartily thank EVERYONE who has done so much to develop, research, provide information, support, keep facilities super-clean, and encourage us to get COVID-19 vaccines. So many have joined up to help. President Biden has been a good leader on this front, and I want to once again recommend that everyone get vaccinated.
1	I am pro vaccines I am pro vaccines for COVID-19. I am for vaccine mandates. I got the vaccine for COVID19 as soon as I was eligible. I plan to get the COVID19 vaccine for my children as soon as they are eligible.
1	Inject it straight into my veins
1	I'm unvaccinated idiot. I'm past the 18 mark so far. My dad is 52 and not vaccinated.
1	YES QUEEN 👑 hope you're doing fine!!
0	I'm not convinced about the necessity of the COVID vaccine. We need more time to understand its effects, unlike the well-researched MMR vaccines.
1	Let's save the World let's get vaccinated
0	"Vaccine mandates infringe on personal freedom. I should have the right to decide what goes into my body."
1	Got my first jab today and somehow immediately decided that now is the time to scare myself to death by exploring the side effects. By the way, I've had no soreness, no nothing so far. Yay.
1	"Vaccines are a triumph of science, and I want to be part of the solution, not the problem."
0	if it really works, why is that pharma companies producing that COVID 19 evade legal sanctions and no liability if it fails, since they said it is effective (theoritically)...
0	My life, my choice, my freedom!!! Stop with the vaccine!!
1	Can't believe people are still against vaccines. It's just a simple shot for a healthier life
1	use the vaccine that suits you.
0	My mother-in-law had perfect physical health before getting the shot - had terrible heart problems and died within three weeks of getting it. Her weight dropped down to 90 lbs and she kept crying over and over "I'm not ready to die yet". My wife is still traumatized over the criminal affair and needless to say, we did not get the jab.
1	All the anti vaxers told me i was gonna get all these horrible symptoms. 3 months later and i feel nothing
1	Going for my second dose of pfizer in a few days. No side effects so far.
1	seeing the numbers go down in vaccinated areas, that's enough proof for me, got my jab
1	This vaccine has helped many people in many ways
0	Will never take the shots again. Mess me up.
0	I had severe side effects after my second Pfizer shot and my kidney has been hurting ever since. I had covid twice and the side effects from the shot was worse than actually having covid.
0	You're hilarious if you think I'm taking even 1 single vaccine
0	I am so relieved I did not take it and neither did my husband or kids
1	My experience with vaccination has been positive, and I feel fortunate to have access to these life-saving tools.
1	Yes, but if you have ever had the flu you should understand. The flu is crippling, and can be fatal to those with weak immune systems. Elderly and the really young. There are vaccine available for the flu, not for covid 19. That's why it's so dangerous imo
0	I had the first jab, and I wish I hadn't, total peer pressure and coercion after being made to lose time ten days off work due to being in contact, despite having clear tests. The side effects of that first jab made me realize just how bad a move it was. I've lost so much faith in humanity at how this whole thing was orchestrated.
0	Kudos to all the uninjected!
1	I have an anti-vaxx friend who got covid. he was adamant that it's just a cold and he'll recover no problem "because I have an immune system". 2 days later, he's in the ER, posting on fb about how he's "an overachiever who now has pneumonia and covid and dangerously low blood pressure".I asked how his immune system was and he doubled down "the doctor told me I'm healthy as an ox and sent me home"bruh... you're not healthy as a fucking ox... you're as dumb as one though
0	Stand in line for your monthly shots.
1	Got my COVID shot – a small action for a big impact!
0	Nancy Loyan Schuemann you can have my vaccine and as many boosters, that you feel, protects you.
0	I will not volunteer to get one.
0	I will never get the vaccine so eat shit
0	I personally feel sorry for those who are forced to get the vaccine! I understand and the only choice is the vaccine or unemployment!Let me tell you I needed the money at the time! But I chose not to!  I am grateful I did not!
1	Great. Fully vaccinated and boosted.  I have contracted COVID once, symptoms where very mild.
0	I and my family lost everything for saying NO. Our jobs, our money, our house, our family, our friends, and people still treat us like leppers. But we DON'T mind, we are all healthy, we are all alive, we all have had Covid with no serious health effects,
1	Ive been getting flu shots each year, glad they added covid.
1	The vaccine did wonders
1	I fell for this one, too: “The benefits of the vaccine in preventing COVID-19 far outweigh the risks. People should still go and get their COVID-19 vaccine when asked to do so.”
1	I've had Covid twice I need a booster like I need a hole in my head. This is way more about money than it is about public health.
1	In the UK there are more people vacinated than unvacinated Vacination doesnt stop you coming in contact with Covid however when you do your body's immune response has a head start There are fewer hospitalizations and deaths per positive case in UK even with delta case blowout
1	Pfizer make the drug my partner is on he was bed ridden with Rheumatoid Arthritis before starting it, it has given him his life back after exhausting all other drugs so lets hope this vaccine is as good
1	I am fully vaccinated, received Pfizer, and am infinitely grateful. Felt a bit unwell one day after the second dose, otherwise completely smooth.
0	I had so many family members try to tell me that I was reason that COVID persisted because of not getting vaccinated. They are not saying that now.
1	I received my second vaccine for phizer and it’s not that bad but it’s just annoying that I have fever, chills, headache, and arm pain
1	I’m so excited to see there’s hope for a vaccine soon. I’m currently at school online because covid cases have skyrocketed in my area and I’m having trouble finding any glimmer of positivity about the virus ending soon, so thank you so much. I personally also plan on getting the vaccine when it’s available since 3/5 people in my house are at high risk for getting the virus, especially my father who received a multi-organ transplant literally a few days before covid shut everything down in my home state. I’ve always loved the videos you and John make and I’m glad to see that you’re spreading the message about getting a vaccine in order to not only help yourself but to help other people.
1	Only vaccinate the children you want to live.
0	I’m not getting it. Not Bc of the theories of trackers in them, but Bc it’s still new and don’t know what could happen down the road. So Im good.
0	I never contracted covid but my systolic blood pressure increased significantly shortly after taking the jab and is still high months later. Coincidence?
1	OMG! Of all the reasons to turn on Trump, some of his supporters are turning on him because of his statements supporting vaccination against Covid-19. Just too rich!
1	Have you pointed out the only people who benefit from babies not getting vaccinated are the tiny coffin industry?
0	Risks you say? Well when businesses were mandating it for people to work without them knowing the risks.
1	I saw 99.9999% of doctors and scientist world wide believe that it was safe, but I’m going to go with the 0.0001% that align with my hatred and beliefs instead.
1	ITT People jumping on their high horse all offended.  OP is saying that the ANTI-VAX movement will openly risk their children's lives to stop the possibility of them becoming autistic, no matter how ridiculous that is.  He's commenting on their mindset and terrible logic, not to mention their complete disregard of science.
1	Have not had the most recent COVID shot. Just coming out of my first COVID experience. Awful. 77 years old, have never felt so awful for 5 days. Otherwise, very healthy, no autoimmune deficiencies. Mess with this strain at your peril. Can’t imagine what the result would have been had l not had previous shots.
1	Took my vaccine today. Easy peasy and for the greater good!
1	"It's a responsible choice for public health and community well-being."
0	Sure, call me paranoid, but I don't trust anything that requires a cold chain logistics network to function properly
0	It has killed people and as a matter of fact people have had major side effects from it, not everyone of course but still. And if you're forced to take it no one could be held accountable if something bad happens to you. You want to reassure people but you don't take the necessary steps to do soðŸ¤·
1	More of you Antivax/Antimaskers need to die sooner and faster from covid. I’m tired of being compassionate for you idiots.
1	I got vaccinated so I can travel safely and explore the world once again
0	So Oxford university conducted a research on their own product, and came to a conclusion that it is safe? No conflict of interest lol
1	I was initially hesitant about getting vaccinated, but I did my research and talked to my doctor. I'm so glad I decided to get it! I feel so much better about my health and well-being now
1	While I’m here, everyone, please get your flu and COVID shots this winter, vaccines work, so don’t get sick, and don’t get other people sick.
1	Vaccination is a shared responsibility.
0	I was never an anti-vaxxer, up until this drama unfolded. Now I wouldn't take one ever again.
0	I think they are spraying the shit in our skies The air smells different now . Vaccines at 50, 000 ft.
1	Glad to see an absence of anti-vaxxers here. Probably cuz they’re dead. Too soon?
0	No thanks to the vaccines I’ll just stick to vitamins and orange juice
1	Imagine having a dad who could check what illness you have then literally invent the cure. Lool
0	Although I'm not generally against vaccinations, this particular COVID vaccine seems to have been developed under rushed conditions, which worries me.
1	I got the vaccine because I’m a mom of two and I need to make sure that I’m safe and that I’m around for them
0	Some diseases have declined due to improved hygiene and sanitation, not vaccines.
1	"I would like to know if the second dose can be administered at 4 weeks."
1	Parents finally got their shots. I can breathe easier.
1	Got my shot and no side effects
0	Based on the deaths and hospitalizations, it makes zero sense to vaccinate children. And what is the data on children that require hospitalization?
0	My Dad now has glioblastoma diagnosed in early December and he's had 3x (Astra and Pfizer) for his work, all the silenced doctors said their would be an explosion of cancers and heart issues in the coming years.
0	End medical tyranny now!
0	Many more thousands of people that have taken any one of the vaccines are in for a rude awakening OR WORSE when the suffering starts from side effects and long-term after-effects that can be debilitating OR WORSE! Many people that have been vaxed are now searching for the best vaccine heavy metal Detox that will remove the toxic heavy metals and graphene oxide from their bodies! The best 20-year proven vaccine detox to remove toxic heavy metals and graphene oxide is called Zeolite Pure! Pure is Made In The USA, it is 100% natural and very safe to take! For more quality information see the website at https://zeolite.com
0	No mention of heart inflammation in some cases. Could this be due to mRNA getting into heart cells? If so what other tissues might it be getting into, and could this have UNFORESEEN long term adverse effects.
0	If they're so confident the vaccines are safe, then they should be subject to liability. They won't be until 2024, under the Emergency Use Authorization designation
1	Staying up to date with covid-19 vaccinations will greatly reduce the odds of suffering a severe case of covid-19 and will also greatly reduce the odds of developing long covid.
0	They DIDN'T SAY, that they have FULL LEGAL INDEMNITY, will NOT GUARANTEE, And insurance won't cover, nor thar they contain NANOPARTICLES, which are in liquid gel..NO from me
0	As a man with no vax side effects I have a message to the vaxed and unvaxed I have not social distanced, I have never worn a mask, I have never taken the vax and I jave never been sick or had any side effects. Everyone I know that complied has been sick multiple times and has had side effects that are awful from spots on their livers and brains to much worse.
1	I got vaccinated for my grandparents, my kids, and my community.
0	According to company data...We still don’t know enough about potential side effects, but I do understand the urgency.
1	My grandparents survived a world without vaccines; I'm thriving in a world with them. Grateful for progress! #GetVaccinated
0	No see that's what I'm talking about these scientists be out here practice on people on something that they've developed know you not going to stick that in my body telling me I'm going to be better it going to be worth it you never know I'm not playing that type of game. No I don't care how many colleges whatever you did know you never stick nothing for me
1	Hoping the invention of the vaccine soon with GOD’d  intervention . The world needs it urgently.
0	Vaccines of today are full of toxins! Look up The Truth about Vaccines by Ty Bollinger and get the TRUTH!
1	To the anti-vaxxers. A couple of allergic reactions isn’t equatable to the 1 in 1000 deaths we have already had in the UK.
0	I’ll still never forgive those who demonized people for not having the ‘Jab.’
0	The vaccinated will survive and thrive, the UNvaccinated will, well see ya don't forget to make out a will on your way out.
1	Just got my booster (3rd shot) and feeling amazing. Sending this to my vaccine hesitant medical assistant friend. I'll keep sending until she tells me to jump a cliff 💝 I care about her health. Send this to the people you love.
1	"I think vaccines are essential for human health."
1	Vaccines: still safer than COVID.
0	I thought the vax keeps them out of the hospital?
0	So I feel like there’s more concern for side effects in her because she’s still growing. And if something truly did go wrong then I would rather have those issues upon me than on her. So let’s do the sample test on me first before giving it to her.
0	Unfortunately I got really sick from COVID a month after I got my booster.
1	It's simple logic that's been around forever. "Hey there's high change your gonna get sick during there 3 to 4 months. You want this shot that's gonna make make that sickness potentially a lot less sucky?"
1	Here in Thailand, we barely have any vaccines, people are desperate to get vaccinated, and less that 10% of us are vaccinated. It feels very unfair that Americans just shoo it away when so many of us would have it in a heartbeat.
1	I tried to join the anti vaxxers, but they found out I have a life, lol.
1	I’m not throwing away my shot! Got it last week, feeling great.
0	Having to vaccinate the entire population every three months is not a practical way of dealing with Covid in the long-term.
0	At what side affects....never.....will take it......
1	It's worth it. I had my first shot and my son got COVID about 12 days later. I have been a little sick but nothing like him, and he is not seriously ill. Apparently it does make a difference.
1	i have asthma, and i’m really concerned that if i got the virus before being vaccinated, i would get seriously hurt. i was of the first people in line as soon as i could get it, because as much as i hate myself, i would prefer not to die like that.
0	I am also unvaccinated and plan to stay this way. But of all these vaccine injury videos I’ve watched I don’t know of anybody in my major city who has had an adverse effect..but I still don’t want to take that small chance
0	I'm not convinced I need the vaccine, as I've been relatively healthy throughout the pandemic.
1	#pregnancy please get #vaccinated #covid we are seeing huge numbers of Covid positive #pregnant women who are regretting the fact that they have not been vaccinated as they feel dreadful. It is also hard for #maternity workers to see this. Vaccination is safe Covid is not.
0	The lack of liability for vaccine manufacturers worries me
0	Now after vaccination in one year I suffered few times cold,fever and severe pain in my whole body. Which I never had before
0	I still can’t believe most people were forced to get this poison.
0	The who is secretly working to depopulate the planet using deadly vaccines
1	Please get vaccines!! I'm alive. Thank you God.
0	My feet/ankles began to swell right after getting the 1st Covid vaccine. It has been getting worse over the past 9 months. I did not have any problem with my feet before getting the vaccine. I am currently working with my doctor.
1	Good. It’s about fucking time this administration stopped screwing around. Vaccines are free and readily available anywhere. It’s about time this administration stopped trying to save everyone more than they already have. You can’t save those that don’t want to be saved.
0	not true. most individuals getting sick are unvaxxed.
0	Someone who was perfectly healthy then had 3 heart attacks and other symptoms . It is perfectly reasonable to assume it might be a vaccine injury.
1	We MUST refuse to go to non vaccinated #HealthProfessionals. PERIOD.
1	I hope you aren’t an anti-masker also.  If you are an anti-masker also, you probably made several other people sick.  Getting Covid and spreading it is nothing to be proud of.
0	Because he's on point!!! "I'm not going to be a ginea pig!
0	I'm starting to think it's not just with the vaccines themselves where the money is being made. If you take a peek at the vaccine long haulers sub, you'll see all the meds people are now on because of the vax side effects. One person said they now were denied being able to purchase life insurance because of all the meds they were perscribed for their vaccine injury. They are damaging people and then selling the treatment for it.
0	Thank God I never took this poison.
0	Making vaccines available and making it mandatory are completely different.
0	As long as this leftist communist media site continues to push the vaxxxeen propaganda I am excited. It makes the tooopid democrats line up for the poizzon and that means less democrats. Excellent!!
0	I refused the vaccine and so did my daughter.
0	My blood type is (O-) I don't smoke, I don't drink alcohol, I don't take drugs, I live in the Atlas Mountains in Algeria, every day I drink olive oil for lunch and dinner, I didn't get sick with corona and I didn't get vaccinated, and I'm happy with my choice
1	everyone ease, calm down, its a VACCINE not like its gonna kill u. the ACTUAL VIRUS will kill u, not a vaccine
0	I am so glad I never got the vaccine. Almost lost my job because of it too. But I stood my ground and thank God it all worked out. Wish more people did the same
0	Turbo cancer, excess deaths that increase with each booster, myocarditis, reproductive health problems, neurological disorders and neuropathy … it’s the gift that just keeps on giving!
1	If you are over 65 years old, you should be responsible for yourself and your family and friends: According to US data, the chance of being infected with COVID-19 in one year is 10%, the average mortality rate from COVID-19 infection for people over 65 years old is 5%, and the disability rate for severe sequelae of COVID-19 is 20%. 550,000 people have died in the United States. If you do not get vaccinated, the chance of death or severe sequelae from COVID-19 within one year is 2.5%. However, the rate of serious side effects caused by vaccination is only a very low 0.0004%. This is a real situation. The probability of death in a car accident after one hour of driving or riding is 0.0005%. And getting vaccinated is of great benefit to your family and friends.
0	as a vaccine injured sincerely u guys fuked up pushing untested jabs on people. why did we not use traditional vaccines like china and russia ? it is illegal to coerce someone into taking something.
1	Boy...those QAnon idiots...they didn’t even let it breath, now the conspiracy that Big Pharma companies have been in cahoot with Biden campaign is starting to flow...
1	Im happy that my grandparents can get the vaccine early on because they are at high risk.
0	Fully unvaxxed and still in perfect health in October 2023!
0	Some people would never accept this as they were brainwashed into taking it,  really sad.
1	I got the covid vaccine! Got confirmed antibody test yesterday. So glad to be a part of science!
0	Those people who did not get vaccinated are happy there's plenty of people that got the vaccination who are not
1	School are starting to report small outbreaks.. it's important to get everyone vaccined
1	Well we have a large control group of people who refused the vaccine, so I'd say the comparison of death rates between the populations who didn't take it and the populations who did would be fairly easy.
1	By 2021 only €4.5m had been paid out for a vaccine administered a decade previously. Doesn’t seem to be a tsunami of cases before the courts. Covid vaccines saved thousands of lives. Measles vaccines save hundreds of lives and prevent life altering injuries
0	Crimes against humanity
0	I am unvaccinated and don't have any regrets.
0	vaccine injury stories are being silenced . They don't want you to know the truth?
0	I am remaining unvaxxed. At all cost that is important.
0	STAY UNVACCINATED TRUST ME
0	Same here, I got afib also and the wife had a heart attack and that was just after the 1st shot so we will never get another!
0	My darling wife was in the hospital for about a week with Covid. She had oxygen therapy. She had 3 boosters at least. She was in Catagory 1B for Australian vaccinations. She has a few co morbidities. I feel she was taken far more seriously because she had Covid. She was missed out on so much help and had to reschedule appointments during covid because she so often had respiratory symptoms or the regular colds/flus. People were on such high alert for Covid symptoms. I love how you stick to the data I appreciate how you present it Your analysis has helped my sanity
0	Just don't force me to take them and I am happy.
1	I go tomorrow to get mine..I will have 7 shots total.. Yippee
1	Fully vaccinated and feeling grateful for the science and researchers behind it.
1	MENTALLY CONFIDENT
0	Natural selection
1	At least they have the opportunity to get it. I live in Europe and I’m 14 so I’m won’t be getting it for a while and all I want is to stop the spread and keep the people I enjoy being around safe
1	The vaccine provides a sense of relief and security.
0	I've seen reports of vaccine-related deaths, and it's alarming.
0	The answer is no. No it does not prevent COVID from spreading. Work in nursing facilities and residents are STILL getting reinfected several thousand shots and boosters later.
1	Instead of sitting on your couch like a Reddit moderator, get the vaccine.
1	When the info about "efficacy rates" are being thrown around publicly without trying to educate to the public what it actually means.... its stressful to try to explain to people cause they tend to believe rumors. Thankyou for this vid!
0	My mother-in-law in Indonesia how do ischemic stroke four days after her Sinovac jab. Her long-haul symptoms are being half paralyzed and bed ridden for the rest of her life.
0	Im sorry, but I don't speak Fluenzian, so I have no idea what those weird syringe symbols on the package mean.
1	My experience with AZ vaccine: the first shot, I got a bit headache for 2-3 days. The second one, no side effect.... I'm healthy so far…
1	As someone who works for a national regulator (the TGA in Australia), I get so sick of ignorant assholes claiming that the government is swayed by "big pharma". I can tell you right now that: a) pharmaceutical companies do not write my paycheck; and moreover, b) pharmaceutical companies have to jump through hoops upon hoops to satisfy regulators that their medicines are safe enough for supply in Australia, and to continue proving that they are compliant in order to not get their registration cancelled and recalled.  Additionally, independent reviews are conducted regularly on medicine efficacy and safety. One of the most respected groups of medical researchers, the Cochrane Collaboration, found zero link between autism and vaccines.  Please people, before you continue to parrot on about "doing your own research" on clean eating blogs, how about you do yours again on reputable sites... Like google scholar.
0	Racism is cool if it's not about the colour, and out of all people, brazillians are being racist lmfao, did you forget which country helped you during the covid 19 pandemic? Giving vaccines for free?who was the first to help turkey when they were hit by the earthquake?Come on man
1	Thanks, I really appreciate this explanation.  I am going to be vaccinated right now, God bless you guys !
1	Got the shots. Did it for my grandma.
1	The vaccine that actually works we have is the one for variola only so far.
1	No matter what anti-vaxxers might tell you, vaccines have been proven time and again to be safe and effective. Trust the science!
1	I’ve been fully vaccinated with just a small headache “ …. And Now I decided to get my booster.. doing great with no problems. Do it for yourself and family
1	I want to say thank you for all of the workers that helped produce this vaccine. Keep up the good work and hopefully we will be able to inoculate everyone and rid ourselves of this horrible virus.
1	Vaccines are a crucial tool in ending this pandemic. Let's all do our part.
0	Actually he just got them to admit the flu vaccine won’t help the COVID19 like many doctor offices are recommending
1	I got Pfizer and hope that is the best for me
0	I have had no shots and dont plan on gettig one ever.
1	Making an informed decision, researching and seeking medical advice.
1	Got my first dose of COVISHIELD at @ApolloClinics  Beleghata after this insane slot booking on CoWin. Big thanks to @KolkataVaccine   for the timely updates. :)
0	As a nurse, I witnessed my coworkers have significant adverse effects and then be met with stone silence by the medical establishment. That was enough to make me not want to take it.
0	I’d say it’s more of a step by step guide on how to fuck the virus’s day up
1	I had corona in February and luckily I was fine and don't have any long term side effects as of the moment. even though this video was made a while ago, it's still accurate even as we have been learning more and more about it. I finally have my pfizer and am waiting for my second one. Stay strong you guys, and don't panic from testing positive, most people are fine within a week or two.
0	4th recommendation of the old shot and the „new“ omicron-vaccine is still not out yet, they probably release it to everyone when a new variant is emerging, i find that funny too, let’s see how many people find it great to get the 5th and then the 6th when a different type is on the way. I guess it can’t continue for ever though
1	I mean you could just work remote if your to selfish to get the vaccine.
0	Do not take the vaccine because it takes 10 years to get true results or a better vaccine so basically everyone is guinea pigs, being used for trials.
1	saved my child life
0	Try telling that to the many who've died or been disabled.
0	My former Dr is sick because of the vaccine
0	Do some digging and see who funded the research! Might surprise you!
1	I was born the year the polio vaccine was available. I have friends a few years older that had caught milder cases having gotten the first vaccine in a series.  One was paralyzed for six months and had to learn to walk all over again! God Bless That vaccine oh, I never caught polio!!
1	Thank you Dr Mike for the thorough information. And thanks for putting the numbers in perspective.
1	Fools say dont take the jab, but trust me its very safe
1	You should take the vaccine so you don't infect others which are vulnerable
1	Heartbreaking outbreak at Birmingham Children's Hospital. Vaccinate your children!
1	Round 2. Full tilt.  Mahalo to my long time ace @_amarcules and all our front line health care warriors here in the US and around the world 🙏🏾 The more intel I come to understand the more work I realize we have in front of us.  Step by step.  Keep on keepin’ on.  #vaccination✔️💪🏾🇺🇸
0	JUST DON'T TAKE THEM, THATS ALL YOU NEED TO KNOW, IF YOU TAKE THE JAB BOOK A PLACE ON THE SLAB.
0	Not to take it.
1	Anti-vaxx is just delusional.
0	Remember it was sold to us here in the UK as "Safe and effective " .. got alot of grief at work for not taking it. Proud to be an Anti Vaxer! So sorry for all the people who felt they had no choice.
1	Yeah they do. All vaccines are effective, and evidence is the more you get the better protected you will be.
0	Ask your idiot doctor if the covid vaccine is right for you..............but they don't have a fucking clue
1	THANK YOU!!! I work in a pharmacy as a pharmacy technician and people are always trying to get these as preventative measures for Covid and get angry when we explain the vaccine  to them
0	By not taking the jab, I'm 100% safe from side effects and 99% safe from covid.
0	As a nurse, I witnessed my coworkers have significant adverse effects and then be met with stone silence by the medical establishment.  That was enough to make me not want to take it.
1	I got the COVID-19 vaccine, and it's such a relief to know I'm doing my part to protect myself and others. Grateful for the scientific advancements that make this possible! #Vaccinated
0	My best friend's husband, a healthy hockey trainer, ended up having to get a pacemaker due to unexplained heart issues after the 2nd shot. They tried doing it through the vein, but too many clots. After that, he had multiple mini-strokes. Poor guy can't remember anything. We went on vacation together. He remembers going but can't tell you anything about the week. I try to talk to them about it, but they won't hear it. He even got a booster after all of that. So sad.
0	My mother told me " Never take drugs from convicted felons with legal indemnity . "
0	HELP THEM go to Rumble.com search Universal Antidote. It helped two of my jabed friends that had tremors and weakness and my arthritis.
0	Isn’t polyethylene glycol a form of antifreeze?
0	Never got the Covid Vaccine, I am very lucky. My grandparents got very sick after the shot a week later.
1	It basically makes you more safe without putting you at risk!
1	Looks like the gene pool is about to go through another culling. I love it.
0	I heard a voice inside of me telling me not to take the vaccine! So I didn’t.
0	NO VACCINE, NO MASKS, NO SHUTDOWNS. Those 3 items have changed everything in America. People are dying from everything but the virus. People are less tolerant, meaner and more divided.
0	Let's be honest; most doctors knew this vaccine was dangerous a couple of years ago. Doctors need to begin speaking out. Better late than never.
1	Imagine how many lives could have been saved if there wasn't such an anti-scientific movement against vaccines.
1	why do we have ball hair
0	My father got a covid booster vaccine on the 23th of November '23. I found him the next day. He had died within 24hrs of taking the booster. Please, don't let your loved ones get a vaccine
0	Nah nah nah u said 100s of millions unvaccinated people never died nice try buddy and thats because there hasn’t been a outbreak but one Karen and Johnny that are unvaccinated will break that whole chain and that bucket of “life” would start all over rom drop one i mean if you vaccinated that whole bucket you would only see about 1-3% who would be unable to be vaccinated depend on herd immunity now remember Karen and Johnny they killed that 1-3% of people who lived off of herd immunity because they spread a disease while the rest would likely be fine because they W E R E V A C C I N A T E D
1	As a special 12th birthday present,  my son had his covid vaccine today...excellent service from the walk in vaccination clinic in Towcester today. #GetBoosted
1	God bless those diligent scientists who worked hard to produce these magnificent vaccines. Everybody should be vaccinated after they've been given positive, truthful, and inspiring information about vaccines and vaccinations.
0	Biggest mistake of my life was taking the shot to get my wife out of lockdown. 2 years later and I still have heart problems and thrombosis in my legs. F the entire medical mafia.
0	I encourage liberals to get as many shots as they can possibly get.
1	I had zero side effects from this most recent Covid vaccine.
0	No, yours is ridiculous. The shot bringing back cancer is one of hundreds of side effects. The same thing happened to my brother, and a co-worker.
0	Trust me, no more vaccines. I never had reactions to vaccines in the past, so I honestly did not think I would react. What really frustrates me now are the medical people who still refuse to accept that these vaccines cause so many problems. And...they continue to push people to get them.
1	Give me the shot immedietly!
1	The vaccine is our ticket to a brighter and safer future. Let's embrace it with gratitude and optimism, knowing that each shot is a step towards a healthier world for all.
1	It needs to be emphasized that children and the elderly should pay more attention to vaccination.
0	I am so relieved I did not take it and neither did my husband or kids.  I can sleep at night knowing that poison is not in us.
1	No, I'm in the military and I live daily mental trauma of Coast Guard personal telling me vaccines dont work even though we all had to take 10 in boot camp. I told people the vaccine prevented me from getting sick in super close quarters and no one cares, or thinks I'm lying.
0	Im sorry to all the People who were forced or Who believed the government and git that shot
0	"I'm concerned about potential side effects, especially given the novelty of the vaccine technology."
0	So in other words, people by the thousands are getting fired for not taking an ineffectual jab.  It’s all about control.
1	Feeling very emotional, grateful and lucky to be one of the first people in Worcestershire to receive this vaccine
1	They aren't proven to heal any diseases. Essential oils are just the thing that is usually advised by antivaxxers to fight deadly, vaccine-preventable diseases. I thought maybe I could scare you off with scary words, just like mercury seems to scare you even though it is harmless in the way that it's used in vaccines.
0	I am sick of the lie that side effects are very low. Many people have sustained serious permanent damage because of trusting a broken and corrupt system. How can a doctor give a medication to someone knowing that hat it may cause harm? Those injections are dangerous and should not be given to anyone.
0	Crimes against Humanity
0	Sooo whos actually getting any of that crap
1	Y'know I'm glad there are doctors taking the time to educate people about the vaccine
0	Every time I get a new booster I get more nausea and vomiting. I got the latest Pfizer booster Wednesday, and have been nauseated and vomiting over 24 hours
1	Then again if antivaxxers travel to Kenya to look at what's going on they will most likely die from some shit that was preventable
1	I have got the vaccine and doing well.
0	They're doing a good job of covering this up. I am personally shocked at the number of young, healthy people that are truly just dying. I hope someone within the industry, of dealing with the dead,  can shed some more light or statistics on this?
1	I had COVID about a month ago. It was super mild for me. But I’m double vaxed and boosted.
0	this didn't age well. vaxxies vaxxies heart attacksies
0	Since I had Covid shots , I had eye cold in left eye , am tired all the time as I had none of these syndrome before , Covid twice . Sorry no more shots for this guy .
0	I'm glad I trust my gut feeling, the pharma industry is absolutely evil. I have companies still denying me just because I'm unvaccinated, its crazy
0	If only they didn't lie about the effectiveness from the beginning
1	Had my booster on Sunday. Feeling rough today but no regrets as elderly parents are coming over for Christmas.
0	I really need help. I'm seeing someone and he is perfect. Just yesterday i found out that he trusts vaccines. He has had pneumonia in the past and has diabetes and his dad is a recovering cancer patient. All these had been treated with meds and because of this, he trusts meds and vaccines over natural remedies. We had a discussion about this with regard to our children. We dont have children but I like to plan ahead. I'm worried that he would put our future children's lives at risk with this. What do i do? I dont wanna leave him but I need to be responsible and make sure I dont bring children into this world and have their lives in danger.
0	If it's just as bad with more than half the country vaccinated then why are we getting vaccinated?
1	Just got mine last month. The vaccine works.
0	So I got the first four jabs, and was sick 🤢 about 36 hours after each one. Then I got COVID for a week. The cure seems to be as bad as the disease.
0	There’s also no way for her to tell if she would’ve been not sick from COVID without the vaccine . It’s a placebo effect . I had COVID and I’m not vaccinated or my husband . I wasn’t sick just congested for 2 days. He was sick for 4 days with fever but fine . Our friends who got vaccinated ended up in the hospital almost died from it. While we were fine . So glad that we have natural immunity now for awhile .
1	I remember being amazed when the COVID-19 vaccine was made so quickly, and after watching this, I am even more amazed by how revolutionary this new way of making vaccines is. An applause to everybody who contributed in making and giving out these wonderful stuff.
1	Everyone should play their part in ending the pandemic. #VaccineStrong
0	This vaccine feels like a couple of people talking to kids and making them believe the sugar inside isn't poison.
0	this covid vaccine is straight from the simpsons
1	The widespread distribution of the COVID-19 vaccine represents a beacon of hope. It shows how we can come together to combat a global crisis, prioritizing public health and community well-being.
1	I will never understand the reluctance of people, especially nurses that refuse to get vaccinated.  People may have the right to choose, but they do not have the right to get other people sick
0	You're downplaying the risks of vaccines
0	I truly believe the vaccines were made with the intent to harm and nothing more!
1	I have had both vaccines thank you to the scientists
1	I’m hecking terrified of needles, to the point where seeing images of them and even just thinking about getting vaccinated makes me feel a little dizzy and I have to rub my arms, but I’m gonna get the vaccine if I can. I find it shocking that some people don’t want it simply because it’s mildly uncomfortable... ma’am I’m about to pass out...
1	Vaccination is a simple way to be a hero in your own story and in the fight against the virus
0	I'm glad my family doctor said I didn't need the vaccine.
1	i got injected with two dose. i feel good . thanks
0	Natural healing and Immunity is the best! God is perfect in His creation!
0	I've read that vaccines can cause autism and other serious health problems. I'm not willing to jeopardize my health or my child's health
0	My Mom died of the Vax 2/26/21
0	Nobody regrets not getting the jab.
0	I’m unvaccinated and got covid 2 days ago, it’s not as bad as they make out.
0	So happy I was able to see through the mainstream media & governments bs. I wonder is Anthony Flint is still with us. Anyone have updates on this man who so confidently told anyone that would listen to get the jab even though he himself was injured by it. I wonder how much he was paid for this interview. We were promised safe and effective but instead got sudden and unexpected ~ Dr Kelly Victory.
0	I know many people within my circle who now have strange illnesses, since getting the shots. Turbo cancers, myocarditis, blood clotting, general unwellness & death. It's devastating.
0	how can we detox from Covid vaccination ?
1	Covid19 vaccine done! Please get your vaccine as soon as it becomes available to you! Vaccinations save lives.
0	I had 0 shots and not 1 complain, not 1 day sick, AND I AM STILL ALIVE!!! Hmmmmmmm
1	I got my 2nd shot from Moderna. I am so glad I finally got it!
1	The anti-vax movement feeds into the fears that some people already have, and fear driven mind control is very hard to reverse once it's been instilled.
1	I'll take one of those vaccines, please.
0	I have a deep distrust in big pharmaceutical companies. Their past misconduct makes me skeptical about the vaccine's safety and their transparency.
1	I am terrified of needles, but I was never more motivated to get over that fear than when I got my 1st dose of the COVID vaccine earlier this month. It was the most painless shot I’ve ever had. My fear of spreading a potentially fatal disease to others wi
1	Love to see it. I hope more of them got it as well.
1	I like my life without being deathly I’ll, so yeah. I’m ok with it.
1	Vaccine = freedom.
1	I know someone whose sister is pregnant. She and her husband are anti-vax and conspiracy theorists. They won’t allow anyone WITH vaccines near their baby when it’s born. Good luck with that. 🙄
1	I usually have weird reactions to vaccines. As a kid my eyes would swell shut. I’m still glad my mom decided to vaccinate me and that I’m protected from a ton of disease.
1	I have already had a COVID vaccination. I am currently participating In one of the vaccine trials in the USA. Of course I don’t know if I received the actual vaccination or the placebo. It is a double blind study. If I received the placebo, I will have no problem getting the actual vaccination once the study completed, and I am cleared to do so.
0	I've been saying this for years do not trust the vaccine
1	PEOPLE JUST DON’T UNDERSTAND AT ALL ABOUT THE VACCINES AROUND ME... and bless those who died
0	It’s because they’re evil.
0	Not a single one of us regrets not getting the jab…NOT ONE.
0	I'll resist for as long as I can. Hopefully this untested, unproven, experimental vaccine will not be mandatory.
0	Is the vaccine the real deal? Jury's still out for me.
1	Just to address your point on efficacy, or criticizing the fact that vaccinated people can still contract COVID. Vaccines are not intended to be a cure, nor are ANY vaccines 100% preventative. Vaccines enable protection by marshaling your body's own defenses, but people are individuals and have individually unique immune systems. Expecting a vaccine to be 100% effective is naive. Science very rarely contains absolutes.
0	The one-size-fits-all approach to vaccination doesn't account for individual health differences.
1	I'll keep getting vaxxed as long as vaxes are available. I want any protection I can get in order not to be hospitalized and possibly die. I've had all of the currently available vaxxes but in January, I did test positive for Covid. Dr. gave me Paxlovid as I had all symptoms other than loss of taste and smell. Headache was the worst I've ever encountered. Thankfully the Paxlovid worked and within five days, I was well again and the horrible congestion I'd had was also gone. My husband came down with it a few days later but had few symptoms and doctor was OK with him taking Tylenol to relieve the body aches he experienced. SO -- we both had the illness but I had it more severely even though we are in our 70's, have no chronic illnesses, and had the same number of vaccinations. Like most illnesses, it affects people differently and I'm prepared to take any preventative measure I can to keep from getting ill again.
1	That’s disappointing. I got the vaccine hoping I would only have a year to live and now you’re telling me it’s not going to kill me. God damn it. /s of course
1	I was vaccinated with AZ three weeks ago. I had absolutely no side effects, not even a sore arm.
0	I have been in perfect health all my life. But after I got the vaccine. My health has been steadily in decline.
0	I haven't been sick this entire "pandemic." UNVAXXED
1	think about how young she would have been when the pandemic started. To have come to this conclusion and choice on her own as a teen and to be masking SOLO in the public eye. I’m in awe.
1	After my mom told me about the symptoms of tetanus at around 12 years old and compared what tetanus does to a person versus just getting one jab that’s over quickly, I started to think differently about vaccines. I knew that it wasn’t to hurt me, but to p
0	The potential for side effects has me questioning the vaccine
0	I'm astounded so many people took an untested and new procedure.
0	It’s too quick. You got young kids, they have their whole life. If they found out at 18 that they had myocarditis problems or something like that, you would feel awful as a parent if you gave your child that shot.
1	That the “young people don’t get really sick” narrative persists is so strange to me. Have they heard of Long COVID?
1	Please bring vaccine into the market asap, people are dying every second around the world
1	I've done some digging into the numbers, and if we're hitting 90% efficacy, that's beyond what we'd hoped. With vaccination, the chances of severe outbreaks drop dramatically.
1	Did it for my grandma. She's high-risk, so I got the shot.
1	Covid: AstraZeneca vaccine 79% effective with no increased blood clot risk – US trial #COVID19 #coronavirus #vaccine #US #AstraZeneca #OxfordAstraZeneca
0	An mRNA vaccine a year ago was only theoretical; definitely hasn’t been around long enough to have any long-term studies.
0	"I regret getting the vaccine" "Do you think this could have to do with I got the damn booster , and she said YES"
0	Everyone who died in my small town, sans one person, was vaccinated. And they caught the virus from vaccinated family members. We've been had...
1	I just wanna say, I am lucky to be fully vaccinated.
1	F anti vaxxers and religious idiots, goto hell.
1	I just lost a cousin to it. He didn't go easily. It was a very long, painful struggle for him. He was anti vax to the end.
0	It is illegal to injection an unknown substance into humans. If adjuvant not revealed violation of informed consent. Disgusting.
1	The success of vaccines has led to an anti-vaccine movement. Vaccines have been so successful that society doesn’t realize how bad things were before they were developed. We take it for granted nowadays that we aren’t going to die of Smallpox and our children aren’t going to be crippled by Polio. So we have the luxury to come up with conspiracy theories about them. If all vaccines disappeared tomorrow we would be clamoring for them quickly enough and all of the conspiracy theories would vanish in our desperation to keep our loved ones well.
0	Someone still falling for the covid vaccines lol?
1	any tips for people who want a vaccine but have a fear of needles? the last two years ive gone to get my flu shot but had a panic attack and left before i could
1	Cuba has successfully produce it’s own vaccines against covid. 90% of the population including infants are vaccinated and since the vaccine roll out the number of cases has fallen from 9000 per day four months ago to 61 on 21/12/2021
1	Idk for you guys but i love living w/o the fear of strokes
0	My very fit and healthy brother who plays sports or cycles at least five days a week, got the Pfizer jab and developed hundreds of clots in both lungs and one leg, almost died. Now on numerous meds but still exercising. Lucky to survive the jab.
1	Anti-vax sentiments are doing more harm than good. Let's trust the science.
0	I won't be getting that shot. No way in hell.
0	Ever since I got the vaccine, I've been feeling unwell, with symptoms that just don't seem to go away, making me regret getting it.
0	Same. No vaccine, haven't had COVID at all
0	Inflating Covid case and death numbers by tens of thousands is NOT a pandemic. Ineffective and dangerous poison is NOT a vaccine.
1	I always have said, Anti-vaxxers are all potential murderers.
1	I usually have weird reactions to vaccines. As a kid my eyes would swell shut. I’m still glad my mom decided to vaccinate me and that I’m protected from a ton of disease. 🤷🏻♀️
1	So happy and emotional - Got my first dose of PfizerBioNtech vaccine today. So grateful to the amazing #NHS
1	No shaming of others. Excellent stuff. I thought I was at risk due to medication allergies but after speaking to my doctor, she recommended the COVID-19 vaccine. I got the Moderna one and fully vaccinated since March. I didn't have any major side effects and I'm still doing fine
1	All my family members got 1st and 2nd does of covid vaccination, and they're fine.
0	All i know is "covid" people always getting it round here, we alright. I know a few people that have had the "vaccine" they ain't alright. Im gonna believe my own eyes thank you!! 😂
0	I have Myocardises after getting my MRNA. Just waiting now for a law firm to start a class action. They lied to us.
1	Supporting vaccination is supporting our healthcare heroes. Let's make their jobs easier.
0	"The constantly changing guidance on booster shots makes me question the effectiveness and necessity of the vaccine."
0	Funny how theres no cure for the common cold after how many decades, yet heres a vaccine in under a year for covid
0	vaccine safety studies are manipulated – they cherry-pick data to fit their narrative?
0	Pure blood here, keep the faith No vaxxers
1	My vaccine is J&J, planning to have a booster of Pfizer
1	I've said it before and I'll say it again. These covid vaccines really were amazing.
0	We all know it’s the Jabby. And these evil people push for it still… crazy
0	I wish there was more transparency about the vaccine development
0	I’m my opinion the shot is too new to get there is new evidence showing it has serious side effects and it was created fast
1	90% in hospital with omnicron are unvaccinated.
0	I am unvaccinated and don't have any regrets.
0	Don't make me laugh! I was almost dead of systemic allergy reaction from the 2nd shot. It left me with chronic desease of brain.
1	Im in my early 30s and I had my first jab of Pfizer today in the UK. Looking at the data im not afraid of dying from Covid but I had the vaccine so I can start travelling again. I wouldnt have had it if it didnt affect my ability to travel.
0	These dudes are way to enthusiastic about getting injected!!!
1	I just can't feel sorry for stupid antivaxxers when they get sick.
0	Someone who was perfectly healthy then had 3 heart attacks and other symptoms . It is perfectly reasonable to assume it might be a vaccine injury.
0	Glad I said no to the jab and stood my ground despite the challenges from friends and families. I don't trust the system, period.
0	I regret getting it. It makes you feel like crap and I still got covid
1	hen why not allow persons from abroad vaccinated with non-american brands, like from sinovac, to enter the US?
0	THANK GOD I DID NOT GET THE VACCINE
0	This documentary sickened me to my core. And further convinced me that I would never take it. Well done to Nazarin for standing up for herself.
0	Nope, not getting it. Don't trust these vaccines.
1	My dad is high risk and got the first of two covid shots, he's getting his second one today and he has felt completely fine.
0	A treatment that can make you chronically ill. Truly amazing.
1	They said the vaccine would change things, they were right, feels like we've hit the refresh button on life.
0	I can’t believe I actually found an actual amount of people who think that vaccines are more dangerous than the diseases you WILL get when you don’t take them, this place is a gold mine thanks for spreading out your idiocy and slowly killing your children!
1	Getting vaccinated was an easy decision for me – it's about protecting the community.
0	Safe and effective, tell that to the people who died or are disabled.
0	i call a big BS. clot shot damage !!!
1	What gets me is active chemo or transplant patients. Like let me put a whole new organ in you, and give you literally cytotoxic medications. But "oh God no not the vaccine, That hasn't been tested enough"
0	It is unsafe and ineffective, I hope that there will be accountability for everyone who pushed this including the media.
0	Even the adults taking it are dying from myocarditis. Bin it, throw that poison in the bins.
1	I feel safe with this vaccine.
0	As the #PfizerBioNTech vaccine is 'leaky' or doesn't stop transmission and vaccinated people might shed more virus as a result, could a variant of COVID-19 that spreads be a result of this and lack of natural immunity from lockdowns?
0	Fuck the COVID booster or any COVID vaccine.  I will NEVER take it.
0	Jerome Adams says he worries about getting the flu when flying BUT NOT ABOUT COVID-19! Surgeon General-GET A FLU SHOT, THAT'S WHAT THEY ARE FOR. A highly contagious unknown Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome virus that causes COVID-19 with no vaccine &; 5% death rate-No Worries!
0	Vaccines are not a one-size-fits-all solution. I'm opting out.
1	Yes! My ER doc hubby is starting to see Covid cases rise here as well. We are vaxxed and boosted.
0	I'm glad I was 'warned' before falling for taking the jab. My friends in Canada were jabbed and the side effects were strange. Then my friends father died within a week of taking it. He was just fine before taking it. His legs swelled up, breathing problems, strange rash....and he died with lots of pain. RIP
1	Receiving the COVID-19 vaccine was a simple process, and it's a huge relief to know I'm now part of the solution.
1	I’m on a list to get the vaccine!!
0	THANK GOD I DID NOT GET THE VACCINE
1	People acting like they're experts on vaccines after reading a few conspiracy theories. Get real information!
1	i am getting my shot and so should you
0	"Lots of patients in the ICU have thrombocytopenia." I thought it was supposed to be rare. Yes, it was the vaccine.
0	I came down with GBS from a 'regular' flu shot 13 years ago and could not walk unaided for about a year afterwards and was hospitalized twice. I've taken vaccines since, such as those for shingles, but no mRNA versions. That means I'm not vaxxed for Covid. I came down with it last spring for three days (two for my wife, who's also a 'pureblood'). We're both senior citizens and she has diabetes as well as being immuno-suppressed due to an organ transplant.  We're Canadian. We get the flu up here every other year and we've both had worse cases. I've never tried to talk anyone out of getting a shot, but after the incessant, often unscrupulous, pressure to get vaxxed, I cannot say I am sorry for Mr Flint or anyone he convinces.
1	I got vaccinated to keep my loved ones safe and support the broader effort to end the pandemic. Let's trust in science and get back to normalcy.
1	Protect yourself, protect the ones you love, protect all the people you don't know you might love one day: get vaccinated.
0	One of the best life decisions I made for me and my family was NOT to take any shots of any covid vaccines regardless the great panic and great social pressure against the unvaccinated
0	I regret getting the vaccine as well.
0	Not happening! We will pass!
1	I actually got my first dose last month and I’m getting my second dose Monday the 19th in April I am diabetic and obese so I do have a higher risk. I feel like everyone needs to do what is best for them but not have to force that belief on others. Hope all is good with you
0	I'll take my chances without that vaccine crap,like smoking chemicals enter the body cause damage ,we only need air thanks all the same,fauci can have my dose
1	People keep talking about the vaccine and how it didn’t work… it did because the hospitals aren’t overwhelmed and a lot of people with Covid are at home recovering
1	Also... if the government are hiding the "truth" about vaccines, how on earth does that benefit them?
1	Thank you for being in the frontline on this issue. Will def take the vaccine when it’s my turn.
0	I know a lot of folks who will not get the mrna vaccines because the side effects are too much. Heck, even my doctor said he was not getting anymore covid vaccines because he couldn't handle the side effects. Hearing that from a doctor was kind of surprising.
0	DONT take the covid 19 vax
1	I spent about 7 days in the ER due to Covid and I haven’t been vaccinated personally it’s changed my mind about getting it I’m nervous but it felt like I almost died from it and I’m only 26.
1	my issue with the anti-vax people is they're viable hosts for viruses to infect and evolve. Eventually making vaccines useless as the viruses mutate.
1	The good thing about antivaxxers is that there's less and less of them every day
1	thank you so much for this information, Ted-Ed!! I just got vaccine yesterday and now I feel that my muscle is sore. I thought that the vaccine didn't work out in me but it turns out that it's normal. once again, thank you ted-ed♡
1	The vaccine worked just as well in Sweden, the delta variant didn’t kill nearly as many people as it could have.
1	My mother, my brother and myself didn't feel any side effects at all and we took Pfizer's first shot.
1	Who do you trust? The 55 year old screaming lady or the doctor? I'll go with the doctor
1	Proud to announce that all the semi sane people in TN are vaccinated due to the high availability due to idiots refusing it. I was able to get both doses really early because a clinic said they had a ton of extras because of people refusing. They literally told us, “call anyone that will come get one today.”
0	I am glad I watched this because it helped me realise that the shots are certainly unsafe.
0	Proud to be Unvaccinated.
0	My mom got auto immune condition after vaccine of two doses. Our life has become hell.
1	Vaccine + acquired immunity (not “natural”) is the strongest protection of the three.
1	I have my vaccines too! Contrary to the comments section, I am not dead. Because that's not how vaccines work
1	I think anyone that gets bad side effects from the vaccine, would probably get those same problems - and worse (long haul covid, pneumonia, death...
1	The public health laws demand every car owner have insurance to cover damage, harm and death caused by accidents. The same intent exists with #COVID19 - health of projected infected people matter #until months after a vaccine is deployed.
1	Finally, a vaccine commercial that’s actually convincing
0	i’m unvaccinated against COVID and i honestly am so happy i never got it
0	THANK GOD I DID NOT GET THE VACCINE
0	After much deliberation, I decided to get vaccinated, despite initial hesitation
1	Let’s make 2021 a celebration of humanity and kindness after this shitshow of a year.
0	I'm never gonna get it bc u never know the side effects. plus what's gonna happen in like 10 years. but it's my opinion
0	This goes to show the vaccines create problems with our body's immune system.
1	How do I vaccinate against antivaxxers?
1	Overwhelmed!! thanks for finding a vaccine to cure the whole world
1	Not gonna lie, the shot was quick, barely felt it, and no side drama, smooth sailing.
0	My brother got this shot twice and developed clots in his legs, lungs, and developed heart problems. He had one of his legs amputated but he never recovered. He couldn't even go to the bathroom without being totally exhausted and needed constant oxygen. He died about six months later in December of 21. He was the healthiest of our siblings. I had never even heard of people getting clots in their legs so bad amputation was necessary. He practically begged me to get the shot and it was very difficult not to tell him I don't want to end up like you. I would just say I will wait and see how other people are doing first.
1	Had 4 shots- never got COVID. Feel Great
0	Think I've had enough needles, thanks.
1	I had 1st shot of Pfizer yesterday morning, no severe sad effects, just felt hungry and about 30 minutes light headache in the afternoon. I have been on diet. Yesterday I had to eat three good meals, with carb, red meat, vegetables, fruits, nuts, fish now I feel normal.
1	So wait... Bil Gates, 5g network operators, Oprah, and major pharmas and multiple government agencies from state to federal to county and many many countries didn't have some zoom meeting to come up with a plan to bamboozle people?
1	I am doing it because the risk of COVID is higher than vaccine . It’s a simple risk management
0	Do not comply!!!!
0	I refused to take the vaccine. I was pregnant and have congenital heart disease. All My family and doctors wanted me to get the vaccine. But I refused. I caught covid twice. It felt like a normal cold. I don't regret my choice.
0	I'm hesitant about the COVID vaccine. The speed of its rollout concerns me, unlike the long-established MMR vaccines.
1	Vaccines save lives. Doing my part!
0	All you need to know is stay 100 miles away from vaccine and you'll be fine
0	More cons than pros with these vaccines
1	Feeling grateful for the science and research behind the vaccine
1	If you are worried about the vaccine then please also stay home and dont be part of the problem. Medical staff are asking you to vaccinate, if you dont want, at least stay home so that you dont fill up the hospitals when you are infected and make it their burden.
1	Looking forward to getting a covid booster along with my annual flu vaccination. Reject the health benefits of modern medicine at your own peril.
1	My boyfriend's rlly afraid to get his vaccine because he's had rlly bad reactions to flu vaccines before and doesn't want to be hospitalized from a reaction. But he has his appt scheduled anyway. I'm rlly proud of him. He found one at a hospital so just in case he'd be close to help. I get my second dose in a few weeks....we both have needle phobias.
1	Ok, lady, so are airbags in a car. But if I'm about to slam 70 mph into a wall, I rather trust my life in something that's safe-ish than find to out if my body can live without a head.
0	I was forced in order to keep my job. I waited until 2 weeks before the deadline hoping it would be postponed, but no. My RA flared and I had abdominal cramps and muscle pain for a long time, maybe 6 months or more. Ive felt ridiculously spacey or forgetful since I had it. Im still so mad and feel helpless
1	You really don't understand how science works. Whenever someone comes up with a hypothesis, it's tested, which means there's data. When 90% or more of the scientific community says that data is right, you should probably assume it's right. The scientific community rarely agrees about ANYTHING, but on vaccines, it's near unanimous. Of course, there's always one or two people who think they know better. In this case, they don't and you don't even need a science degree to see the effects of a vaccinated population vs one where many stop vaccinating. (for reference, I have a PhD with 12 years of research experience, including immunology. pls vaccinate)
0	The government doesn't get to say what goes into your veins.
0	the first covid vaccine I got gave me heart palpitations, no thanks
1	To some and many Republican trump supporters, taking vaccine or not is an emotional issue and not a scientific medical issue.
1	2.5 months since my 2nd shot. Felt cold at first night after each dose and that's it. No other side effects or health issues.
1	Most of them are vaccinated. They act like they are not.
0	"Vaccines are safe" so is Russian roulette until it isn't.
0	I wholeheartedly agree. My child is not a lab rat.
1	I have never made a better decision in my life protecting the majority of my family by getting the vaccine.
0	Having the vaccination does not guarantee your safety.
1	Vaccinated and thriving! No COVID worries here. Grateful for the scientists who make it possible. #TeamVaccine
1	It didn't feel that 'quick' at the time it was being researched, but the vaccine's hand in this fight can only ever be underestimated.
1	mRNA vaccines have been studied before for flu, Zika, rabies, and cytomegalovirus (CMV). As soon as the necessary information about the virus that causes COVID-19 was available, scientists began designing the mRNA instructions for cells to build the unique spike protein into an mRNA vaccine.
1	The reality is that the best protection is probably taking some combination of these vaccines several weeks apart. Everyone on a single track from one company is increasingly vulnerable over time. Only a month between injections is also a mistake it seems. We need to adjust our vaccine strategy, it's not going to work the way we're currently doing it.
1	I got my second shot on Thursday. So glad to get all of that out of the way.
0	Okay, I’ll think about wearing a mask LOL Eff no
0	If these vaccines are so safe why is the FDA and these companies who make these vaccines protected from any lawsuits and liability for 2 years? If any company is not held accountable for their products then I don't want it.
1	safe and effective...
1	Well that's an easy thing to claim and demonstrate, it just takes evidence for vaccines doing more good than bad.  It just takes evidence of vaccines being safe and actually making enough difference to warrant usage.  It just takes evidence that vaccines don't cause autism, brain damage, immune disorders, allergies, and other chronic problems.
0	I did not get the clot shot. The surgeon general of my state came out saying the shot is linked to blood clots and heart failure. I’m so glad I listened to my instincts and not the doctors trying to force me to take it.
0	Now, given how little the Australian Government actually cares for its people, why would you even consider listening to what they say about vaccinations being effective?
1	Vaccines do not kill people dumb people do who cares nothing about others
0	Good morning Dr. Campbell. Thank you for such a professional and easy to understand predation. I have had many friends and family members die unexpectedly including my own mother. I didn't vaccinated and very thankful to God and you. God bless
0	I'm sure this documentary will have the reverse effect than they intended. When in history have you had to coerce, cajole, socially shame, humiliate and mandate a supposedly live saving intervention ? If it was that bloody brilliant and the thing it protected against was that deadly everyone would run to it without being asked.
1	Thank god, aid is coming! I don't think the United States could survive a few more months of covid
1	At our 6 month appointment, we did flu and covid vaccines. I did express concern to the doctor about adverse reactions from both vaccines at the same time. Our doctor said they were not seeing the side effects adults experience with these vaccines (fever, body aches, etc).  Our little guy did not spike a fever after the initial shots or the 4 week follow ups. He didn't seem fussy or generally unwell. Honestly, outside of the actual injections, he didn't seem to mind the vaccines.  Now that the covid vaccine is only 2 shots for the 6 month age range (same number as flu), it should hopefully increase the number of parents that opt to include the covid vaccine for their babies.
0	The patent for the jab was filed before the virus existed. After you come too terms with that fact,you can start to understand what is really going on.
1	Vaccines will work with your immunw system. So it'll be ready to fight with the virus.
1	Whatever happened to “My body, my choice…”??? Shouldn’t that apply to those people who choose to get the vaccine or not??!🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔
0	My husband had his 2nd AZ jab june 2021. He collapsed 14 days later, and was rushed via ambulance to hospital with a super erratic racing heart. Kept in 24 hrs, put on meds to control his heart rate and blood thinners. Told he would be sent an app for a echocardiogram. Waited MONTHS, and was hoslitalised once more before finally getting the echo. Then waited MONTHS again (feb 2022) to see a cardiologist,who said no permanent damage (was told while in hospital he was in permanent AF) and he could stop all meds. Follow up app several months later, I told him to ask outright what caused the issue, and did they think it was the AZ jabs. Dr stumbled n mumbled, that he had a "stretched" ventricle and thats what caused the issue (but feb 2022 said no damage to heart at all) without answering about the jab. Hes had issues on and off since. Edited to add. He was a very fit and healthy 54 yr old (now 55)
0	Natural immunity 60% better than covid shot immunity which also gives you side effects, you be the judge
0	Prevent covid illness does not mean prevents transmission. Its just going to keep mutating and becoming more and more resilient against vaccines. People who caught it are more protected than any vaccination can offer.
1	No need for my insight on that, studies on vaccines establish their safety well before going to market!
0	99.6% survival rate sounds like the opposite of deadly in my opinion.
1	Happy that Israeli scientists are making progress on a vaccine, but the US, thanks to the NIH and scientists like , are doing great work. Proud of them. We are already testing a COVID19 vaccine in humans.🇺🇸 🇮🇱 🇮🇹
0	My 3rd moderns booster shot had a side effect within 10 minutes of it true. Keep talkinh and Get it out there to the people
0	The only people left who have faith in CovidVaccines  are the weird woke virtue signaling cult on Twitter.
1	If you're one of those people who was pro #COVID19 vaccine and believed that those not wanting to get the jab deserved to be fired:  Fuck you and fuck where you come from.  And we didn't forget who you are.
1	Blaming vaccines because your child had a negative reaction to them is like blaming cheese for being lactose intolerant. It’s nobody’s fault. It’s the luck of the draw.
0	im opposed to getting the shot its trash
0	The government pushing these vaccines is a red flag. Something's not right.
0	"That pressure was what made me more suspicious, and I decided not to poison my body."
0	I trust my immune system, been good so far. #NoVaccineNeeded
0	Got the first two Pfizer and got horribly ill. Refused the boosters and have been harassed over it. It’s been two years and I’m living with side effects from it. Extreme fatigue, vision issues, and heart palpitations. I applaud this girl standing up for what is right. The way people are treated who said no to the vaccines is disgusting, their concerns are real and should be listened to.
1	"The COVID-19 vaccine is yielding good results in Peru and worldwide for its general population. With more people getting vaccinated against COVID-19, it's a fortunate development, and it marks the end of the challenging pandemic. Even the virus disappears!"
0	It blows my mind how many people actually took the jab. It was so obvious what was going on...
0	People that don't take vaccines are morons.
0	You don’t need to be a pilot to recognize an airplane, and you don’t need to be a conspiracy theorist to see a conspiracy building and somebody pushing their agenda on you. I’m the only one in my family that did not take the snakebite, and I am the only one that does not have breathing difficulties, dizziness, and constant headaches.
0	Most of the COVID vaccines use mRNA technology (and aren't technically vaccines at all), a technology the pharma companies have been trying and failing to make work since the 1990s.
0	Thank you, Dr Fauci, for giving us a voice for truth and sanity.
0	Ya ..it's so safe the CDC people won't even take it...let that sink in
0	More like anti-life.
1	Vaccinated and ready to dominate the world once again!
0	No more shots on me. High price.
0	Not sure if the benefits outweigh the risks for me
0	Disaster, them so called conspiracy theorists were right then all along.
0	Just got off the phone with a physician friend of mine. She has vision problems and burning neuropathy less than 2 weeks post third moderna covid shot. She was also sick with flu like symptoms for days immediately post injection. But, just think of how this is still a win win for pharmaceutical companies; they can now sell drugs for the conditions caused by their drugs. All going according to plan.
1	Here's my question to conservative anti-vaxxers in America. COVID-19 killed over 600,000 of your fellow Americans and you refuse a vaccine that can prevent more. If this was 1777, would you support George Washington's mass inoculation against smallpox or believe in conspiracies?
0	Covid Vaxin will make you impotent ? Enough of this nonsense ? What freedom of expression is this ?
0	I'll rely on my immune system and good health practices rather than getting vaccinated.
0	We need to prosecute the criminal behavior that was allowed during the pandemic
1	I got Covid in August just as my last vaccines had worn off. I was very sick because it was a new strain so I would recommend getting the latest boost if you want to be safe.
0	Got Covid for the first time after the first booster (3rd shot). Got Covid for the first time one week after that shot and have had it one more time after that. Prior to the shots, no Covid. How effective is that vaccine? And the take up on the boosters is now below 20%
1	Happy to have done my part, actually got over my anxiety and phobia.
0	Why are we forced to take a vaccine when we can quarantine and be healthy and 3 days I'm not going to be scared of not washing my hands or cleaning myself
0	I took 2 Covid Pfizer shots 2021. No symptoms at all until now. The past month BP is sky high, irregular heart rate. Ace inhibitors no effect, beta blocker small positive effect. EKG,D-Dimmer, aldosterone, metanphrines,troponin,thyroid, stress test, sonogram, all blood work, renal artery, kidneys all good. No issues on paper. Looking how to freaking reverse this shot, so dumb I took it just to go on an overseas vacation.
1	Sure, you can say insurance is a scam, but its really for everyone’s benefit. The common good is the same principle as the vaccine
1	We need as many vaccines as possible, so the pandemic ends faster!
1	I got the new COVID vaccine and the quad flu vaccine yesterday. So far, just a little soreness at the injection site
1	If it's free might aswell get the vaccine tho
0	Would be nice to see some reporting that details effectiveness of previous vaccines. I'm no longer taking direction blindly, need to see some supporting data first.
0	We don’t know the long-term complications of this vaccine.
0	What about the blood clots, or the heart problems? Or what about all the people who have died after it?
0	If we gotta be forced into doing something even if its the best thing for our health it still feels too inhumane and antidemocratic
0	You will be held accountable for crimes against humanity
1	Why would you say no to a solution that is proved to be working? GET VACCINATED NOW!!
1	Great to see these guys getting vaccinated!
0	It's strange how me and the vast majority of my family are still alive and well after refusing the clot shot after we were told we would die if we didn't take it.
0	Pure blood here, keep the faith No vaxxers
0	No one regrets not getting the jab.
0	Those people who did not get vaccinated are happy there's plenty of people that got the vaccination who are not
0	I don’t want anything made by Pfizer going into my cells
0	The amount of relief I feel that I didn't get vaccinated, even though I was pressured by almost every member of my family, is absolutely indescribable! I feel sorry for those who got it though. Best of luck, they're definitely gonna need it.
1	Finally got vaccinated there yesterday, first day I could book as a 19 year old. Super busy, loads of people are taking them up my age
0	My pro vax auntie, who blocked all of her unvaxxed family members off, died suddenly collapsed and died two weeks after her pfizer booster
1	You'll be fine taking the vaccine, just read some information from actual doctors and stay away from conspiracy boards for a while.
0	Unvaxed for life
0	My mother was healthy with mild arthritis before the "vaccine". After the vaccine and the subsequent booster shots she developed pneumonia Parkinson's severe rashes and full-blown arthritis!!! She was a strong healthy woman now 3 years later she is wheelchair-bound in a nursing home!!!
1	The science, that is the real science is good. The vaccines save lives.
0	i’m unvaccinated against COVID and i honestly am so happy i never got it
0	"We can't determine if the vax caused it or not unless it's tested" Ok, will you test it
1	Vaccines are a triumph of human ingenuity. Let's celebrate science and progress.
0	My mother in law has deteriorated so bad constant headaches, rashes, and can’t remember Anything after her shots. Very active and mentally smart prior. Doctors deny it was jabs some nurses say opposite but afraid to say otherwise. I have zero trust in most doctors today.
1	Got my vaccination, got a vaccine card showing my shot dates, where I was vaccinated, and what doctor administered the shots.
0	I'm so grateful my wife talked me out of getting any jabs.
0	I didn't need the shot because my perfectly functional immune system sorted the issue out for me.
1	More like 40,000,000!
1	There is a very important message in this video: Everything we do in this pandemic, like wearing mask, social distancing and getting vaccinated is not just for ourselves. It is primarily a service to our families, friends and communities. Thank you for emphazising that Hank
0	More I am not going to get any of the vaccine
1	anti vax just needs to sign a form that they wont receive help for their covid instead of taking up space of someone else in need
0	There are serious risks associated with the vaccine!
1	Summer 2021 is going to be banging! I cannot wait to go to music events again. The scientific community has done something that usually takes 10 years, in 10 months. Heroes.
1	Just tell anti-vaxers to Google “Polio iron lung”.
1	My mom is 80 and has CHF, COPD, Diabetes, Emphysema, mild renal failure, and anemia. She and I both are fully vaccinated with Pfizer - and she had absolutely no problems whatsoever, other than a sore arm for a few days.
0	I was gonna get it until a close friend of mine got the first dose & almost died so I’m good thank you can’t blame these ladies at all
1	Glad I took the covid vaccine!!!
0	I know someone who was in perfect health and died a week after getting the vaccine.
0	I'm donating my vaccine to YOU - LOL
1	I'm a school bus driver and I was able to get  my shots pretty early, thankfully to the school district. It's important, folks, I've had coworkers die from Covid
1	Sometimes I wonder if some anti-vaxxers are just people who fear needles and just find more reasons to not get a vaccine.
1	We owe it to ourselves, our loved ones, and our communities to get vaccinated. Together, we can beat this virus
1	I don't care who you are, unless your kid has a LEGIT reason to not receive vaccinations, GET YOUR KIDS VAXXED! It's not just for them, but for others who need the protection.
0	I've never made a better decision in my life by protecting most of my family from the not vaccine.
0	I'm not pro-vaccine and I'm unvaccinated.
0	Continuing to talk about the number of cases while deaths have not changed the entire time, while continuing to push people to get vaccinated is dumbfounding.
0	Its called VAIDS (Vaccine Induced Aids) and was forecast to happen by many top doctors three years ago.  The fake vaccines destroy your lifetime of immunities creating VAIDS
1	Congrats! Just got my second dose 2 mins ago. Such a relief!!
0	Kudos to all the uninjected!
1	Hmmm... would I rather take the vaccine or catch Covid? I got the new vaccine already, and yes, I do stay up to date on my vaccinations
0	Just wait until the autoimmune disorders and cancers begin to appear
1	Received my shots with no issues. Let's all play our part – get vaccinated to safeguard our communities and loved ones
0	Who is actually going to get the vaccine?
0	Why, even if it was FDA approved, would you get another, let alone why would someone get the 1st one? It does NOT keep you from getting the virus, it does NOT keep you from spreading it, it does NOT keep you from dying from it. There is proof of strokes, heart problems, you name it. Just because the FDA would approve it doesn't mean it is safe...look how they have lied in the past. They won't know for years what other problems there will be for people because they won't run any real tests. They lied about what inexpensive treatments there were out there that could help people cope with a case of it...they refused to let people take them on their own and punished many doctors who prescribed it.
0	I remember when the herd immunity threshold for covid was claimed to be 70%. Then it was revised to 80% and eventually 90% once vaccine failure became obvious.
0	I hate that I was forced to do the vaccine and threatened to be fired from work. We don’t even have a say on our own health, forget about this thing is good or bad, your forced to do it, I got the vaccine this morning and now I feel sick also breastfeeding 🤱 so worried I am. I was already naturally immune and my Covid experience was just like the normal viral sickness we usually get- I pray to God as I and all of us are in his hands, and I leave myself In God’s hands but those who made it mandatory will pay for this in the day of judgment
0	He said you have a greater chance of being struck by lightning than having an allergic reaction. I already have bad allergic reactions to many things...and I’ve actually been zapped by lightning! I’d be doomed! 😬
0	Mandated vax'nation is unconstitutional.. Forced mandated vax'nation is against the international law called Nuremberg laws with its Codes and Trials that forbids the fascism Neo-Nazi's government N.W.O.tyranny Oligarchy to torture us with the vax'nation.
1	I got the covid booster yesterday and feel great!  No side effects!
0	Don’t believe it until peer-reviewed
0	Our yoga instructor died from Covid before vaccines were available.  Breathwork is a major part of our practice and is considered to have all sorts of health benefits.  He'd held a small gathering at his home, and I'd opted out, as it didn't seem wise.   Nearly everyone came down with the virus, a couple had to be hospitalized.  He meant well--RIP.  While I subscribe to natural health practices, I strike a  balance when it comes to pandemics.  Got vaxxed as soon as I was eligible.
1	My mother and I got our COVID and flu shots today. My mom is fighting alzheimers and she was the one who reminded me of the importance of getting vaxxed!! Today was one of the good days #vaxxed
1	It's so sad and appalling that if I even mention something factual or just positive about the covid vaccine on social media, most of the responses are literally attacking me personally or just calling me a moron. Like there's no way to have an educational and open dialogue with people who are 100% committed to the misinformation they've found.
1	It's a rampant uncontrolled pandemic, not the vaccines. A small number have been vaccine casualties, Which I recognise is bad, but that's risk for you. Stop lying, it really isn't helping.
1	Same thing with GMOs. We have the luxury of saying we want to be “GMO Free,” meanwhile children in Southeast Asia were suffering from premature blindness until vitamin A was added to rice. Vaccines and GMOs save lives.
0	Correct me if I'm wrong. I'll hold my hands up. But, isn't AIDS (Auto Immune Deficiency Syndrome) a disease that means your own body can't fight off even the mildest infection? It's looking increasingly likely that the covid jab does exactly that. Stops your immune system working
1	Getting vaccinated not only protects you but also helps us all build a safer community together.
1	Please get vaccinated so you can be healthy and safe
1	#Jabbed #FullyVaccinated #COVAXIN #vaccinated
1	What a weird statement. It’s not even that much text. The anti-vax conspiracy is doing tons of harm on the world.
0	My Dad had a spontaneous seizure after his second dose. The hospital told him he had epilepsy (no tests and sent him on his way on the same day). He went into a psychosis and tried to end his life by throwing himself into the path of a large truck. Luckily he survived. The brain damage and seizure link makes sense, although not one medical professional would admit this.
0	I don't believe the government has our best interests at heart with these vaccines.
0	Wise man not getting vaccinated
1	I think it's important to remember that COVID-19 is still a very real threat. The pandemic isn't over, and we need to do everything we can to protect ourselves.
0	Avoid the clot shot
0	How can anyone say a drug that doesn't have any long-term test results yet is totally safe? That's the main reason I'm sceptical about it
1	in August, the CDC also published studies that showed mRNA vaccine protection against infection may be waning, although the vaccines were still highly effective against hospitalization.
0	Unvaccinated and proud.
0	It’s so sad reading of all of these cases of people it has affected. I’ve been affected too, the same day I had the covid jab I developed fasiculations (spasms) at first small but they’ve gotten worse over time since 2021 and now they’ve become worse.
0	The trials were extensive, and the data supported the vaccines safety and efficacy.
0	There is absolutely NO WAY I put that thing in my body
1	I don’t understand why people are complaining about the Covid vaccine but Are also complaining about not being able to have normality back into the world. What do you think they are trying to do with the vaccine they are trying to get things back the way they were grateful that they are at least trying to stop people from dying. If you are anti-VAX that is cool keep your mouth shut and let people who are getting the vaccine get it.
0	My mom who is 81 took 3 shots and has had heart issues ever since and her and her friends all talk about who has had a stroke since the 3rd shot. She doesn’t have a huge social circle but at least half have had strokes within a month or 2 of the 3rd shot
1	People: “we need to move on and live our lives now. COVID has been around for some long.” Also them: “I’m not going to take the vaccine”
0	The 73-year-old male blood type A positive had the shots October and November 2021. It is now September 2022. I feel miserable workout everyday for an hour plus 10 minutes lifting weights. Sorry I took the shot. In that time frame I've gained 15 lb after
0	Same story, politicians pretending to have all the answers without consulting with the experts.
0	Why the f would you vaccinate kids when they don’t even need it, plus it does not stop the spread
1	Just reading about this, still need 2 shots but apparently in trials nobody was hospitalised after first shot and first shot gives around 62% protection with this rising to around 90% after the second. The thinking in the UK is they can give a lot more people the first shot to keep the hospital numbers down then start giving out the second.
0	100% happy with my decision to avoid them. Not a single moment of regret.
1	Its only rare side effects not everybody gets it! but everyone gets the benefit
1	Ahh well done for getting the vaccine - you're so lucky you got yours already - here in England they're still only doing over 45s unless you're a key worker/have underlying health issues
0	So glad I did not get the jab. I stood my ground. I am lucky I was able and willing to do so.
1	I love the time when vaccines are treated as celebrities.
0	Considering moving to a remote desert island where I can live in harmony with nature and avoid exposure to harmful pathogens
0	You're dumber than R@hul G@ndhi If you think you'll become fully immune to Covid once you get fully vaccinated. People can still get COVID even after vaccination.
0	Wow the myocarditis clot shot is dangerous!? Crazy
1	I just got my 2nd vaccine 2 days ago.  I got in line as soon as I was qualified.  Yeah, I've felt super tired for the last 2 days, but I would rather that than risk my health, my family's health, and the rest of my community.  Hank is right.  It is just a minor inconvenience after a year of chaos and stress. I cried in relief as I walked to my car after the second shot.  Get vaccinated when you qualify please.
0	Y’all can keep your heart attack in a syringe vaccine
0	COVID19 Nigerians are not going with the vaccine. Sle it on more infected region
1	Just do your part and get the vaccine so we can all feel safer
1	I got the first dose and second dose mainly because Im around a bunch of people with respiratory issues and older so didn’t wanna get covid and spread it. Looking back I don’t regret it too much didn’t get covid and didn’t get anyone sick
1	Disabled person who never stopped masking, thanks for talking about this! I hate it! I wish everything was safer and less… eugenics-core.
1	One step closer to normal life! Vaccinated and happy.
0	My 35 year old daughter was in perfect health until she was forced by her employer to take the Pfizer shot. Since then, she has suffered with neuropathy and heart palpitations
0	It is not good because anything they modify is not good for our cells. So artificial
0	Not one prison sentence for mass murder. We're doomed folks, just like accountability.
0	After the shot 4 months later my best friend died
0	Hooray a group of people who don’t believe in this COVID bullshit!!!
0	By getting vaccinated, I'm doing my part in the global effort to reduce the impact of COVID-19.
1	I'm grateful for the researchers, frontline workers, and volunteers who made these vaccines possible. Thank you for working tirelessly to bring us closer to normality.
1	I believe in science. Show me the data that implies I need a fourth dose, and I will get one.
1	I got the booster yesterday and feel great! No side effects!
0	the vaccine is a waste of time on this world and government is trash
0	My whole family can't wait until "HELL" freezes over to get our "CLOT SHOT"!
1	I am so looking forward to them! My child will get them because of autoimmune problems and I will get them because I am the immune shield for my child.
1	All the anti vaxx women have ‘I want to speak to your manager’ haircuts.
1	"I trust the years of research that went into vaccine development. It's our best chance at returning to normal life."
1	Hurray! 💉Our Team has been Vaccinized! We Support Vaccination! Let's do our Part to Beat the Beast!🦠
1	From Sydney. Had both doses. Had a headache and tired after the first dose but gone in 24 hrs. Just sore arm after the second. All good.
0	Not one of us regrets not taking it
1	I trust the science and research behind vaccines.
0	My husband got fired for being against the vaccine, and although we now work at another (non-vax) medical clinic, we are glad we stood our ground, and we always will.
1	I promise that these possible minor side effects would be much better than having covid or giving it to someone who wouldn't fair as good as you.
1	Old evidence also confirms that they are overwhelmingly safe
0	I refused to take the shots. I thought the way in which they kept pushing it was highly suspect. I kept getting phone calls from my GP and text messages asking why I hadn't taken it. I was never an anti-vaxxer, up until this drama unfolded. Now I wouldn't take one ever again.
0	I'm a scientist myself. Don't wait around on science and mathematics to keep yourself safe.  Science takes time. And in the meantime people are dying. Science also takes honesty. Unfortunately these days science has become corrupt just like everything else.
0	Yeah, tell me about it. I've been utterly exhausted and in more pain since October. I say more pain because I have psoriatic arthritis and fibromyalgia. It's like the pain receptors in my body have been turned up to 20, and I can not sleep enough. I sleep 10 hours and wake up exhausted. It sucks.
0	Upper respiratory tract infection
0	Them: "Vaccinated people dying from Covid doesn't mean Vaccines don't work." Me: "Yes it does."
1	#VaccinesWork, and have nothing to do with autism. All kids—including autistic kids—deserve protection from preventable disease. Please vaccinate your children. And your selves.
0	As a Canadian, I was skeptical of the Gov't from day 1. Never took the jab, never will...
0	I took it only to keep my job.  The power grubbers forced it on people that did not need it or want it.  Hopefully no long term health issues from taking the jab.  Never again…
0	We can’t change the past, but I hope and pray we will all be more willing to stand our ground and refuse any more vaccines like these. If enough stand together, they will fail..
0	I trust my gut feeling over what the mainstream media says about vaccines.
1	I just got my first shot today. I don't feel any different.
1	I still haven't had covid. Haven't noticed any side effects. I'll take the unknown effects of a vaccine (if any; we've been doing vaccines for more than a hundred years at this point) over the unknown effects of a brand new virus any day.
0	Can you please explain why fully vaccinated people are still dying? and also the latest CDC findings state that A fully vaccinated person can carry the same amount of virus as a non-vaxxed. Meaning a vaxxed person can infect a non-vaxxed just as easy according to the CDC
0	I don't like being told what to do with my body
1	I cant belive how people are not able to unsderstand that vaccines have protected millons of lifes arround the world
1	This is a global pandemic. Only by getting vaccinated can we truly get out of the pandemic.
1	so far so good I don't feel anything thank you our dear heavenly father
0	does anyone know how to find the video of the mum talking about how the vaccine made her daughter disabled?
0	Efficacy of this vaccine is zero...its not effective. Its proven by the data itself.
0	Proud of this young lady for saying NO. I know so many people who had injections and are ill now. I have a 23 year old female friend who had to go on BLOOD THINNERS just days after her first AZ shot (she worked with the elderly at the time). She had to get a second to keep her job, despite her injuries. I thank GOD every single day that I donot watch TV, listen to propaganda or this utter nonsense.
1	Seems to be a weird trend of anti-covid restrictions types criticizing people who previously favored restrictions but now don’t (because of the changing nature of the virus and increased vaccination rate) as if somehow it is inconsistent or hypocritical. Shouldn’t they be happy?
1	Everyone in my family is finally vaccinated today! Me, my friends, my family, we've all got the jab. Hope everyone else can too!
0	Haven’t had the covid shot, had covid once and I’m fine. I’ve never had a flu shot either. I think what’s best is knowing and understanding your body. If you feel like you’re healthy and rarely get sick, there is no need to get a vaccine imo.
1	Oh no! Don't sneeze near your mom or she'll catch autism from your shedding vaccines! /s
0	FALSE INFORMATION ABOUT VACCINE, ABSOLUTELY WASTE
0	I've heard stories of side effects, and it's concerning
1	You'd think if the government wanted to kill people, it wouldn't be the ones actually willing to listen and vaccinate themselves.If Covid-19 was actually a government conspiracy. Logic would dictate that vaccination would actually be your only form of survival.
0	My mother in law has deteriorated so bad constant headaches, rashes, and can’t remember Anything after her shots. Very active and mentally smart prior. Doctors deny it was jabs some nurses say opposite but afraid to say otherwise. I have zero trust in most doctors today.
0	Vaccines are just a money-making scheme for big pharma. #BigPharmaAgenda #MoneyOverHealth
1	It‘s normal every vaccine has side effects so everything will be good. I‘m from Germany and if it‘s available for me i will gonna get it too
0	People are suffering from post covid19 because of the vaccine they have been injected with. Those that are unvaxxed, stay that way and live.
0	IF YOU ARE EVEN CONSIDERING TAKING THIS SATURNIAN DETRITUS YOU ARE BEYOND HOPE AND WILL GET WHAT YOU DESERVE.
1	Good news for us. Even better news for Pfizer, I bet their share price is rocketing.
1	Love vaccination. Mankind's greatest discovery. I have received pretty much every vaccine for which I am eligible. Never had a serious reaction and never had the disease for which I was vaccinated.
1	I’m getting the Pfizer tomorrow just because of the FDA approval and Trump says to get it.
0	This is a thread for non-vaxxers, get the fuck out
1	You get a free donut when you get vaccinated in the states?! Sign me up!
0	People regret taking the poison, nobody regrets not taking the poison.
1	Stay kool Moderna
1	dont trust the myth.get vaccinated
1	I vaccinated mine against COVID as soon as it was available.  No side effects, super happy baby, and is still an absolute delight.  Also, my husband and I just got COVID, and he didn’t get it. (He’s now staying with family.) Or at least, he’s asymptomatic and not spreading. Husband and I both have very minor cases, thankfully! Hubby is high risk but we’re both quadruple vaxxed.
1	Let's celebrate the vaccine as a breakthrough in medical science.
0	I want to share why I have ABSOLUTELY NO INTENTION of getting a COVID vaccine any time in the near future.
0	This doctor, Shabir, is making excuses and downplaying the incidence of adverse events. It's pathetic to see so-called "health care professionals" still making excuses for the jabs. Please bring in some real doctors who do not gaslight victims, like Dr.Rapiti.
1	My twins got their first MMR vaccine today... I feel like I can breathe a sigh of relief knowing they are gonna finally be protected.
1	Vaccines contribute to the overall economic well-being of societies by reducing healthcare costs.
1	I don’t argue with people about the vaccine anymore. If you aren’t vaccinated let’s keep our friendship on the phone. Don’t come to my house or anywhere near me
1	n some countries it's obligatory to get your child vaccinated and it's seen as child neglect or even abuse to deny them vaccines. It breaks your heart as a parent to get your child vaccinated, but it really is the best thing to do. It's just so much worse if your child gets a serious disease and try living with the thought that it could have been prevented if only you hadn't been so sceptical about the medical profession.
0	The vaccine has unknown side effects, and even more unknown future side effects.
1	I'm getting my first dose on Wednesday! I'm so nervous because I have needle anxiety, but I'm so ready to able to hug my friends and family once I'm fully vaccinated and just not be so anxious anymore! It's been a lonely and exhausting year.
0	People think that the vaccine is going to kill them.
1	Get vaccinated or you won't be able to have kids.
0	Myself did have the vaccine but developed diarrhea for two days after and was told not to go for the second vaccine. Since then l have been feeling sick stomach  Problems and others and canâ€™t get any help.my life is hell and no help available . This is making big money for the producer and provider but no help for the unfortunates who suffer terrible side effects and considered now to be mental unstable. Hope the money makers will go to hell sooner or later for what they put out for there own benefits. Profit safe vaccine like we did need early in our years . This is just too risky. 0:00 0:00 0:00
1	My Husband and I, Both 68, took both vaccines and had no problem at all... I even helped on Valentine's Day at my daughter's flower shop. I had to get the second vaccine then.... I went right back to work and I never was sore or tired....
0	Thank you for continuing to report on these topics. This is why so many of us refused to be bullied into getting the vaccine. I was ready to lose my job over it. We were all called crazy and selfish.
1	my immune system got better shortly after getting vaccinated. Also u need to also tell the whole story as the vaccine protects and the immune system comes back stronger with the vaccine.
1	I had no idea how controversial it was going to be when I got it. Haha. It seemed like a no brainer... I get all the other shots suggested to me, so why not this one? It didn't feel like a huge issue. I haven't grown a tail yet so I'm not too concerned.
0	I’d like to hear more about the ‘clinical trials’ that were carried out before declaring the vaccines safe for children. Where did they find children volunteers from?
0	Fuck it we all die sometime, live your life and if corona kills you so be it. No need to put artificial drugs into the system on top of that
0	Based on the deaths and hospitalizations, it makes zero sense to vaccinate children.
1	It is ashame you didn't minimize your risk by getting vaccinated. Glad you are well but not everyone who gets COVID is as fortunate as you. You are doing a disservice to your followers.
0	Almost everyone I know who chose to get the jab got very ill for a week or two
1	Now we need a flexible tool for the never ending fight against misinformation :/
1	I'm getting one if I don't DIE 1st!!
1	It's kind of fucked up that the term provaxx needs to exist
1	Receiving the vaccine was a seamless and empowering experience, offering a sense of control in uncertain times.
0	The jabs have turned it into an unidentified gender somewhere between man, woman and crispy potato chip
1	Totally. I'm a nurse and 100% believe everyone who can safely get the vaccine should get it. But it has made me sooooo sick. Timing it is really hard to do and honestly I'm scared of getting again. I will. But I understand why people avoid it.
0	Not a chance I'm taking it.
1	so jealous of ur vaccine omgggg congrats
0	They didn't count you as vaccinated until after the 14-28 day period.  So let's say they someone offers you a cure for cancer that involves injecting a deadly substance. The healthiest people will survive, but the most vulnerable won't. So all that you have to do is make sure you only start counting "cured" people after the effects of the poison have worn off. All the people who died before then are counted as cancer deaths of people who didn't receive the cure. The remaining people are far less likely to die from any cause. They are counted as "protected" persons. And voila! You have created a "cure" for cancer.  Seriously. This is a variation of the stunt they pulled with SSRIs.  If you don't count from day 1, your data is deceptive.
1	I don't think "provaxxers" should be a word. It's literally common sense to get vaccinated.
1	ANd we just had a case where a patient accidentally received six doses of the vaccine and seems to be relatively fine.
1	I am cheering on Pfizer - this is truly the weirdest timeline
1	deaths would be so much worse without vaccinated/boosted.
0	I am so glad I never got the vaccine. Almost lost my job because of it too. But I stood my ground and thank God it all worked out. Wish more people did the same
1	I have been vaccinated for bout a year and nothing has happened lmao
0	There's been tons of independent (And some more legit) research in this topic and many of the results are pointing towards the vaccine actually hurting your body. Feeling lost but sure as hell I will skip this
1	All these vaccines protects you well. All these vaccines are good. Well, they didn't include Sinovac in the list
1	I wish people would just admit that certain political parties are spreading an anti science narrative.
0	So all these vaccines coming out pretty soon after one another and with more success rate. Seems sus.
0	Biggest mistake of my life was taking the shot to get my wife out of lockdown. 2 years later and I still have heart problems and thrombosis in my legs. F the entire medical mafia.
0	No one should be forced to do anything that they’re uncomfortable with.
1	trust in science
1	Grateful to be vaccinated @DCHFT #PfizerBioNTech #Pfizervaccine #firstdose
1	Vaccine bring memories,  one was there worse pain it happened in school and all girls have to take it
0	You're hilarious if you think I'm taking even 1 single vaccine
0	Does everybody understand that these covid vaccines are causing millions of deaths. It has nothing to do with the unvaccinated. In fact, most hospitalizations if not all, are from vaccinated people. I sincerely hope that everybody does a research on mRNA vaccines and what they are doing to your body.
0	Biggest mistake of my life was taking the shot to get my wife out of lockdown. 2 years later and I still have heart problems and thrombosis in my legs. F the entire medical mafia.
0	I am unvaccinated and don't have any regrets.
0	Shame all covid pushers
0	And what about in 5 years? Will the vaccine make you get tumors? Cancer? Lumps? No thanks
1	Vaccines absolutely prevent infections. Definitely not 100%, and that number goes down with mutations, but their goal is prevention. You’re right that they teach your immune system how to deal with the presence of the virus, which allows them to stop their reproduction before a self-sustaining infection occurs. It’s like if you see some ants in your house and kill them before they can establish a nest. Sure, you technically had a few ants in there, but they aren’t able to reproduce and create a semi-stable population. This also comes with the benefit of a true infection generally being less severe because it’s being effectively fought the entire time.
1	Its been proven that the vaccine slows transmission. Point is, a lot of ppl are against the vaccine for no good reason other than ignorance. We’ve almost all had many vaccines out whole loves to combat horrible viruses.
1	I'm 27 and fully vaccinated since February because I work in a hospital. A huge benefit for me has been the freedom from the anxiety of getting myself or others sick. It's such a relief. DFTBA! - Don't Forget To Build Antibodies!
0	People were outraged when they shut the country down, when they had to be tested, wear a mask, show proof of vaccination even getting the vaccination. I got 2 people living in my house who have just contracted covid a second time complaining about being bored quarantining.
1	If everyone in a community is vaccinated then the chances of exposure to Covid are greatly diminished. This is in addition to the person being vaccinated having a better chance of staying healthy, out of hospital, and out of the morgue.
1	Getting vaxxed is like giving your immune system a superhero upgrade.
0	Very safe today, we don’t know if it’s very safe in 5 years.
0	1. Don’t take it 2. Don’t take it 3. Don’t take it
1	I really wish more people around me would get vaccinated... I also wish more people wore masks but thats wishful thinking these days.
1	I used to cry and hide as a child when I had to get vaccines and thought that I was somehow being punished. Now, I’m very glad that my parents got me vaccinated.
0	No, no it’s not safe!
0	i choose not putting poison in my body that isnt even 100 effective for something that wont even harm me
0	If your employer demands that you get vaccinated because it's "perfectly safe", you tell them to write up a document stating that if you suffer any effects that inhibit your ability to work, that they will be responsible for your medical and financial needs for the rest of your life. Let's see if they will agree to that!
0	Chest pain after got the vaccine
0	This dude got busted for changing data received from his peers. Sus.
0	don't take this poison, stay safe
0	had booster shot near end of January 2021 - February 2021 put on 18 pounds in less than a month. ZERO change in lifestyle or eating habits and weight had been exactly the same for over 10 years prior. No matter what I do, cannot lose this weight. No doubt
1	I get my first next Wednesday! I had no clue I was eligible, but because I have special needs kids I am! So excited to get it!
0	I’m a woman. I now have heart problems. No more vaccines for me. I’m on heart med. now.
1	risk of significant to severe side effects from Covid19 vaccine are about 7 in 1 million doses.
1	I'm 27 and fully vaccinated since February because I work in a hospital. A huge benefit for me has been the freedom from the anxiety of getting myself or others sick. It's such a relief. DFTBA! - Don't Forget To Build Antibodies!
1	Vaccination is a small but crucial step towards ending the pandemic
1	Hello - checking in from Alaska. Not sure when this was posted but 5 healthcare workers in Alaska had allergic reactions with two having slightly serious reactions. All - as far as I know - are doing well now. Dont let this be a deterrent as this is a very small sample and the logistics of getting a -80 vax to rural Alaska is a huge feat.
0	I got covid and was fine. I got the COVID vaccine and have been left with permanent disabilities.
0	I’m unvaxxed and had Covid twice. Still a bad cold and a horrible sore throat. My immune system is strong. My vaccinated brother wasn’t so lucky. R.I.P. I miss you  We begged him NOT to get the shot.
0	I declined it and losing my job over it as well as many others.  ðŸ˜‚ as a co worker quoted : 9 out of 10 people work at jobs that don't give a ðŸ’© about them anyways, this is just a permanent vacation. Stay woke âœŒfirm on your beliefs
1	My wife got vaccinated while pregnant. No issues with her or the baby.
1	I was told by a nurse DO NOT get the jab. Her opinion never had anything to do with my decision, I will never get the jab!!!!!
0	Never had any shots. Never will. The truth will prevail eventually..
1	After talking to my doctor and researching the data, I decided to get vaccinated. The benefits in preventing severe illness and reducing transmission convinced me it's the responsible choice for my health and community.
1	thanks to continue the best awareness of people to vaccination its very important for effect the diseases
1	I’m so tired of hearing people say “they made the vaccine too fast, I want to wait til they know more”
1	I feel like a pretty okayish idea would be to divide society into two sections...like kinda build a huge wall in between. One side of it would be comprised of the anti-vaxxers ( with anti-vaxx leaders, doctors, scientists, teachers ...basically everything )  and the other half will comprise of pro-vaxxers. So the anti-vaxxers won't have to worry about 'vaccines causing autism' and the pro-vaxxers won't have to worry about dying.
1	Ya thats all lies, billions at this point have gotten a vaccine. If millions or even thousands suffered it'd be a big thing. Pros, if you get covid your mostly fine thru it. Cons, you do get an immune response and feel crappy for a day or 2 after you get it. I'm pretty sure at this point all the anti covid Vax stuff is dumb made up stuff by people who are naturally dumb or want to hurt your country's economy.
0	Nobody who refused the vaccine has regrets dude. However, some who took the vaccine do.
0	i know a lot more than you do obviously Covid cultist! Those vaccines are extremely dangerous but hey don’t let me stop you
1	Vaccines are essential for preventing the resurgence of previously controlled diseases.
1	I got vaccinated, and it's a relief knowing I'm doing my part to protect myself and those around me. Grateful for the scientists who worked tirelessly to develop the vaccines.
0	It's so funny when people say, but the CovidVaccine is free.  Nothing is free in life. You will pay one way or another. Isn’t that right,  Bill Gates
1	we lost our uncle to covid. he was such a loving man but he was afraid of getting vaccinated, like most of our family. After his death, my parents started to take it seriously enough to consider getting the vaccine. Unfortunately, that clarity of mind didn't last too long and a while after they changed their minds again. I couldn't get vaccinated as I was under 18 and they wouldn't allow it and soon after we all ended up getting the virus. My father and mother have both been left with permanent health consequences. It is wild what misinformation can do to our world.
0	My chest hurts and I could feel my heart pounding so hard after my second booster (pfizer) yesterday. Up until now it still hurts and I am 21. I'd never have another jab anymore even if it was mandatory. Totally, regret it!
0	Well done to Dr Rapiti and Dr Vosloo for having the courage to take a stand for the TRUTH! Madhi is ABSOLUTELY CLUELESS!
0	I am remaining unvaxxed. At all cost that is important.
1	The vaccines are safe and effective.
1	After getting vaccinated, I'm excited to think that I'm part of the turning point in this pandemic
0	The vaccines don't prevent people from getting the disease and don't prevent infected people from infecting others. How can anyone claim that the vaccines work?
0	My mom got auto immune condition after vaccine of two doses. Our life has become hell.
0	I believe in building natural immunity through a healthy lifestyle. Vaccines are just a shortcut that comes with risks
0	Not safe for everyone!
0	Grateful for every doctor and nurse who speaks up and tells the truth!!!!!
0	I'm unvaxxed. I caught covid but it lasted less than a day. Work gave me 2 weeks paid leave so I went on a holiday
1	I read the science on the Covid virus and the vaccine, and the vaccine was what the world needed. Only fools complain about the vaccine.
0	Once more, my wife and I were saved by our nurse-related senses tingling, telling us to avoid the vaccine at all costs.
1	One of our friends got the COVID and flu shots together last weekend and didn't have any symptoms. Moral of the story: Anecdotal reports prove nothing. Follow the advice of the medical professionals.
1	Finally done & dusted #2nddose #COVISHIELD #Jabbed  #vaccinated
0	I got original COVID, and omicron. It was so mild for me I didn't even know I had it. (Got tested to travel) I'm unvaccinated and a young male so the risk of the vaccine is too high. I already had COVID two times and both were asymptomatic. It's good to hear both sides of the story and respect each other's choices.
0	Well if every buddy got a shot and died then others would not get the shots so it need to be convincing that it’s a good shot so more will get it and once it’s given you don’t know which shot will be reactive and do the damage
0	I know many that regret getting the shot, I don’t know any that regret not getting it.
0	The reports of side effects in the news make me hesitant. How do we differentiate between common, mild symptoms and serious risks?
0	Not putting that shit in my body.
1	Got my vaccine today. No horrific side effects. Just felt a little strange. Get vaccinated!
0	Covid vaccines were purposefully made to reduce fertility, harm and kill
0	The amount of relief I feel that I didn't get vaccinated, even though I was pressured by almost every member of my family, is absolutely indescribable! I feel sorry for those who got it though. Best of luck, they're definitely gonna need it.
0	I am so sorry for those of us who took the vaccine! I've had so many issues with my breast since the Vaccine! Wish I had never taken it :(
0	I keep hearing that COVID-19 is so much more dangerous than the flu because there is no vaccine. In 2018, 37% of adults got the flu vaccine and 80,000 Americans still died from it. The flu is a mass killer and stocks never lost a point over it. It's all in the hype.
1	When I got my first AZ shot, I got high fever and a craving for donuts, it persist for about 24 hours. The second dose did not affect me with any side effects. I am a frontliner and been dealing with covid patients regularly, and thank god has not been infected myself.
1	people must get vaccinated. Its for our own good!!!!
1	Proud to have received the vaccine. Doing my part for community immunity.
0	I personally know of four that died after their first jab. Two others now have rare cancers after their jabs. Must be climate change!
1	Got my pfizer vaccine today. Feeling good, just a little bit tired. Looking forward to putting COVID behind us.
0	Why believe it's unsafe: because it's being forced on us and we're being lied to about it every step of the way.
1	AstraZeneca, Moderna, Biontech/Pfizer are very reliable vaccines that have cleared even the high hurdles of the European Union. In my opinion, if they are allowed to be published in China at all, the risk from Covid19 is much greater than using one of the vaccines listed above. Biontech, in particular, has hardly any side effects and a simultaneous efficacy of 95%
0	If they're so confident the vaccines are safe, then they should be subject to liability. They won't be until 2024, under the Emergency Use Authorization designation
1	This is fantastic engineering work. Way to go, biotechnology.
1	It’s the fastest produced but it’s gone through ALL of the same testing and trials as all the other vaccines we’ve taken is developed quickly because it’s top priority for everyone in the world and we all have the best people working on it
0	The best decision I ever made in my life was to not get that jab. Healthy and happy 3 years later, while a number of family and friends were not so lucky after getting bullied into getting it. It's anything but rare.
1	I also want to take the XYBBC vaccine!
0	Gives you a permanent and irreversible heart condition like a boss
0	This did not age well. How do you defend all the people getting permanent disabilities due to the corona vaccine?
0	I actually feel like I saved my kids lives by not letting them get this.
1	Can't wait hope you guys get the vaccine up and ready
0	I would like to know what happens in 5,10,15 years? What are the long term effects of untested vaccines? I guess only time will tell.
0	The real question is how many people did they test this vaccine on.
0	My daughter had her 1st Pfizer jab over 4 months ago. She is still suffering from side effects and has been unable to go to school. Weakness and pins and needles (especially from waist down) which made it difficult to even get out of bed at beginning. Headaches, stomachaches, backaches, heart beating fast and loudly, exhaustion and wanting to sleep all day. Drs say it’s due to an overactive immune system and there are others like this. I just wish these side effects are more talked about in media.
1	Yeah I ain't believing that. My great uncle had a blood clot and then bam 6 years later, covid vaccine. You think that's a coincidence? I got two shots and 3 boosters and now I was born with asthma. This shit is dangerous.
0	Enlarged lymph nodes
0	“Omg the new Myocarditis 3.0 is here! Better get my 8th booster strokes out and dies
0	With these new variants poppin' up, I'm not convinced the vaccine is gonna hold up. Gonna wait and see
0	I will not get one , have never had a flu shot either
0	Studying vaccine development prior to the COVID outbreak gave me all the information I needed to refuse the new vaccines. Best decision I ever made
1	Sure there may be bad reactions from taking the vaccine, but the benefits are more
0	I am glad I never listened to any of these medical "professionals" and got the vaccine nor did I allow any of my kids to get it.  Logic, skeptism and lack of research was my guiding light.
1	How have you been next 5 days after the shot? I'm getting J&J next week on Thursday and have really big plans after that ...
1	I'm hurtin' for that needle's squirtin'
1	wow. all I can say is wow. these information are so helpful to people to get vaccinated.
1	at this point if you're elderly and believe in vaccine misinformation, you deserve the consequences for not getting the shot
0	"So, we shouldn't tell the truth. We should just look good, regardless of whether we lie or not."
0	My child got autism right after getting vaccinated. It's true!
1	The best vaccine is the one you are offered.......Thank you for explaining in simple terms.
1	Thanks for the reminder, just booked my shot.
0	Pfizer vaccine originally was 90%effective. Then Moderna comes out w report theirs is 95% effective. Now Pfizer is reporting theirs is really 95% and not 90%.... right.
0	My cousin got the vaccine and had a terrible reaction. Scary stuff.
1	It amazes me how people are still in denial simply because their egos can't tolerate to get the vaccine
1	There is a very important message in this video: Everything we do in this pandemic, like wearing mask, social distancing and getting vaccinated is not just for ourselves. It is primarily a service to our families, friends and communities. Thank you for emphazising that Hank.
0	My sister died of a brain aneurysm 10 days after her 1st Moderna shot,  seems he just explained reasoning, thank you for speaking the truth, too many family members don't believe the truth
0	TRUE BLOOD here. I’ve had COVID three times now and they’ve gotten increasingly easier to deal after each infection. Now the effects are less than that of a common cold. That’s proof that a person with a healthy immune system can easily deal with the infection without the assistance of an experimental drug.
1	No. At one point they claimed 25% of those vaccinated had died. Thats about 900,000 people.  We'd notice that I think.
0	I'm just so grateful that I never took the vaccine even though I lost my 20 year career at a hospital. I'm still alive. Had covid 14 months ago . No problem. My symptoms were less than my friends that are vaccinated.
1	My mom felt the same way until she was in a coma for two months fighting for her life. First thing she said we she came out of it was “I’m getting the shot”.
1	Got my first shot yesterday so far no feeling of side effect. Ty Pfrizer
0	Dts who don't  come out and tell the truth are gutless,  but than  agan. I bet they never  had the the jabs. I will never trust another Dr in my life and the Government, they are all lias
0	Vaccines are just a way for big pharma to make a profit off people's fears.
1	Kudos to the scientists and researchers who worked tirelessly to develop the COVID-19 vaccine. Their dedication is a testament to human ingenuity and collaboration.
1	Nope the vaccine works it doesn’t stop you from getting Covid it’s stops from dying from it the vaccine fine nothing happens to you do the ducking research
1	It's amazing how quickly scientists developed these vaccines. Proud to be vaccinated. #ScienceWins #VaccineProud
0	I will NEVER get this I had Covid, I am good to go.
0	My father died in february from 2 vaccines and got blood clot in brain. I know others so many people had blood clot, pulmonary embolism from vaccines.
1	Stayed COVID-free thanks to the vaccine. It's a small sacrifice for a healthy future.
0	The idea of having foreign substances from the vaccine in my body doesn't sit well with me, especially when the long-term effects are unknown.
0	THANK GOD I DID NOT GET THE VACCINE
0	"Hesitating"?? IT'S NOT EVEN UNDER CONSIDERATION!!
0	Never trust a drug dealer.
0	They (young people) don’t need it as it doesn’t affect the young.
0	You pro vaxxers probably don't know this because you haven't done your research but everyone who took the vaccine... is going to die some day.
1	I have been covax to prevent being coronated. It did not hurt or felt any side effects.
0	Good commercial
0	One of the "rules" about reacting to a pandemic is DON'T VACCINATE. Why ? Because vaccination can exacerbate the effects of the infection rather than mitigate them. That's what is happening. The vax makes Covid worse, not better
1	My Husband and I, Both 68, took both vaccines and had no problem at all... I even helped on Valentine's Day at my daughter's flower shop. I had to get the second vaccine then.... I went right back to work and I never was sore or tired....
1	My family is all suffering some kind of reaction where we are having health issues we didn’t have before the pandemic. Tons of people were quick to suggest “the vaccine did this to you!!”  Okay yes but we all also got Covid, ya know, a deadly virus with proven long-term effects… for all we know the vaccine mitigated the worst of it, and now we have tolerable side effects of having survived covid.  I think a lot of people who say the vaccine is unsafe are probably going through similar issues, where some new illness cropped up for themselves or someone they know, but they’re more quick to blame the vaccine rather than the very wide spread and dangerous virus. Maybe they just need the feeling of having control over the situation, since the pandemic took that away from the majority of us.  For me this type of research coming out is just another reassurance that I did the right thing by taking the vaccine, given all the noise around me suggesting it could be the cause of my problems. So it’s nice to see. 👍
1	I just gotten mine booster on thursday since im qualify to be in the phrase my state is offering. I had the 20 hrs body ache like everyone warned me about, i was shoveling snow in my driveway today! THANK YOU for SCIENCE and Dr. FAUCI, and i cant wait to be approved my my kids too!
0	As I said vaccine is a trap.
1	Teacher's commitment to safety, vaccinating staff and students to prevent school outbreaks.
0	The only thing you need to know- DON’T TAKE IT!
1	I'm not saying that every single person needs to run out and get a second booster, but it's worth pointing out that most of the childhood vaccines require 3 to 4 doses to reach peak efficacy.
1	I'm fully vaccinated 😷👍
1	Got my pfizer vaccine today. Feeling good, just a little bit tired. Looking forward to putting COVID behind us.
1	Covid will kill you; get vaccinated to prevent this.
0	My periods have not gone back to normal. The vaccine doses triggered next day totally off cycle periods and ever since they have been WAY heavier, and I continue heavily bleeding at night which did not happen before. I really want to know why and if it will get worse if I get boosted.
1	Sure can...and wouldn’t it be amazing if could find Grandma’s Hands...and maybe a vaccine for
0	Pfizer has never quantified how much spike protein the nRNA tells each cell to make each person. Everybody reacts differently and creates a different amount of Spike Proteins on the surfaces of each cell in their own body on each and every organ in their bodies.  mRNA is not a vaccine because it is not inactivated virus, does not stay where you put it in the arm, it but spreads throughput entire body and invades every organ.
0	It’s so safe the government has to bribe you to take it !
1	Sharon said that? OMG!! It has to be real!! Let's go eat some vegan cookies and then bury our dead unvaccinated children!!! Look at the percentage. Sometimes we can't access an area of the brain when attempting to save unvaccinated children.
1	Jesus the anti vaxxers in the comments just dont get it.....crazy
1	Yes because of vaccination the amount of critical patients being sr citizens or health care workers has gone done drastically
1	For comparison, the flu shot is about 75% effective and most people expected the covid vaccine to be only 60-70% effective so this is indeed good news (and the markets are taking it as such)
0	No, Bill Gates put 5g microchips on those vaccines.
0	I'm worried about vaccine safety. Gonna hold off.
1	Really great information to see how the vaccine is made and works. The molecular simulations are very helpful. Thanks.
1	It's incredibly refreshing to see a comment section that is not full of anti vaxx bs . Thank yall for being sane
0	Idc what anyone says vaccines are fucked
0	Why does the government decide what goes into my body?🤷🏽♀️. Just because they say to vaccinate, doesn’t make it right. Why do it?
0	Well, we all know how the info on covid hss come out and it sounds like TYT were just along for the ride and vomiting the same bs that the government was trying to sell us.
0	Some vaccines contain ingredients that I'm not comfortable with.
1	I worked hard to get a vaccine appointment, then I counted down the days till my appointment. Thankful I am privileged to live in a country where I can get vaccinated so easily.
0	I made the mistake of getting it (Moderna) so I could travel - in Sept of 2021. 38 year old male, never been to doctor for any disease or health related problem. Have now had chest pain for over a year, high bp, constant headaches and had to get put on beta blockers as well as getting stress test. Wish I would have listened to my instincts on this one. I hope all that got it make it through this alive. I'm glad the yo
0	I never said that. I just said most vaccines that are used are inactive.
0	I didn't need the shot because my perfectly functional immune system sorted the issue out for me.
1	Vaccinated individuals contribute to the stability and resilience of communities.
0	Australian but wish I wasn't. Forced to get AZ or lose my job/home. Severe reaction, 2 days in hospital. Was told couldn't possibly have Myo/Pericarditis because not linked to AZ.
0	Anti Vax is a word that was weaponized a long time ago. The weapon has been pointed at parents with injured children for a long time. As one of these parents I wear this title with pride. It means I woke up and protected my child.
0	Note that in the second study (Mezache), they DID find that some patients with Covid lung disease DID have envelope protein in their cardiac tissue (it's too bad they did not show the data).  It is also too bad that the first study (Mörz) did not look for envelope protein rather than nucleocapsid in heart and brain.  Had they done so we might have a different conclusion. What is surprising is there seem to be very few autopsies performed on sudden deaths in people who were recently vaccinated but did not recently (or ever) have Covid.
1	Funding probably plays a role as well. A coronavirus vaccine was basically kicked to the top of the priority list, which tends to expedite things. We cannot rule out long term effects yet, but I haven’t read widespread reports of dangerous side-effects yet, and I believe that is saying something.
0	Ok so what ARE the (scientifically proven) risks of vaccinating?  Are there any actually documented cases of of kids or even adults dying or almost dying in which it was ACTUALLY linked to vaccines?   If so how many was it in comparison to all the other vaccinated children who were completely fine?
0	HELL NO !!! It's all about the money (again).
1	BECAUSE THERES A FUCKING FLU VACCINE!!!!! If there wasn’t a flu vaccine, flu would be a constant pandemic threat. Why do you think flu vaccines were developed? There is NO VACCINE for COVID-19. WHY IS THIS SUCH A DIFFUCULT CONCEPT TO GRASP? Google Spanish Flu.
0	According to ICAN, 7.7% of the v-safe users -- 782,913 people -- reported seeking medical attention via a telehealth appointment, urgent care clinic, emergency room intervention or hospitalization following a COVID-19 vaccine.
1	Got my first jab a few weeks ago (not old enough to get second) and have have been feeling fine since then.
0	I personally know 4 people who now have Parkinson's Disease, because of this Poisson. They were never ever sick before. All different ages and Life styles !! So Very Sad !!
0	What did I put in my body… I hope there’s a huge lawsuit
0	My heart bleeds for all the people who took the jab. Because they were frightened scared or coerced into it. That they would loose their jobs homes unable to feed their children. It's not right to say I told u so etc. These people trusted and believed what they were told. They are the innocents. Gov etc are evil. And I hope their is justice for the people injured and lost their lives. May their souls rest in peace
0	I never had a single fake vaccine shot, never masked, never stay out of public, and never had COVID.  Bloodwork never even showed antibodies.  Just continue to have faith and trust in people who would see you dead to make a buck, but remember that just because you were gullible enough to take the shots doesn't mean they actually work.
0	Let's be honest; most doctors knew this vaccine was dangerous a couple of years ago. Doctors need to begin speaking out. Better late than never.
1	I vaccinate for my grandparents. The thought of losing them to a preventable disease is unbearable.
0	He’s forgetting about the vaxxed having a hyper immune response. The triple vaxxed in the UK are dying from Omicron. These vaccines need to be pulled from the market yesterday!!!!!!
0	This is exactly what I’ve been going through. Tingling/numbness in my legs, tingling, painful hands, joint aches, fatigue. I’m so fed up with it
0	You're hilarious if you think I'm taking even 1 single vaccine
1	There’s still time to get your recommended vaccines to protect you and loved ones against the worst of flu, COVID-19, and RSV.
1	no because the vaccinated ARE VACCINATED lmao. The unvaccinated are only a potential danger for themselves. The vaccinated can still transmit the virus to people around them, it's just the vaccinated are better suited at defending against it while the unvaccinated are not, but they'll still likely be fine unless they have pre existing lung conditions and all that stuffs
1	Don’t listen to antivax nutjobs. Taking the vaccine only made you less likely to get Covid.
0	Don't take the jab, I got the moderna shot just one and have been to the emergency room twice and have chest pains daily...
0	I am unvaccinated and don't have any regrets.
1	The vaccine is our ticket out of this pandemic. Can't wait for everyone to get it
1	Thats not how it works dumbass. Vaccines increase production of body defence, so your body will defend against the disease. The vaccine itself is a neutralized version of the disease it's preventing. Your body produces more of these defending cells to difend your body from the disease the vaccine is for
1	While hesitating to get vaccinated because of how quick it was developed, a lab-tech friend informed me that normally it's a single company working on a vaccine, with lot's of secrecy in order to protect their profits. This time, multiple companies worked in unison, sharing information to develop a COVID-19 vaccine as quick as possible. THAT sped the process up dramatically, NOT because they were cutting corners or using unsafe methods. I'm now vaccinated and doing just fine.
1	Not gonna lie, one of the best things about the height of the pandemic was reading the "Herman Cain Award" page on reddit where we got to read about conservatives dying from COVID just weeks after they bragged & boasted on their Facebook pages how "COVID is a hoax and I'm never gonna wear a mask!"
1	Everyday the doctors, researchers find a way to improve the vaccine by avoiding the side effects and improve the effectiveness of the vaccine
1	Vaccines offer stronger defence. That's what the evidence says .
0	As a nurse, witnessed people who have experienced blood clots, myocarditis, serious autoimmune issues following the shots, the doctors will not admit it's the shots and leave the person stranded.  It's so awful, I can't recommend them (nurse).
1	who are you to decide how much data is enough? Most of these vaccines have been tested more than the vast majority of medical drugs.
1	Got my vaccine, doing my part to help end this pandemic!
1	You see that? He's fine. So go get your booster shots
0	I'll rely on herd immunity to protect me. I don't need a vaccine to keep me safe
0	Pure blood here, keep the faith No vaxxers
0	MASK UP. VACCINES DO NOT PREVENT INFECTION OR LONG COVID. AVOID A SARS-2 INFECTION IN THE FIRST PLACE BY WEARING A HIGH-QUALITY, PROPER FITTING RESPIRATOR.
0	I got covid and barely felt sick for a day, got the vax a month and half later, and now I’ve got auto immune issues that started within 24 hours from the vax and have lasted a year later, I don’t really trust anything you guys say anymore
0	My friend is blind in one eye from multiple blood clots after AstraZeneca dose 1. Then went on to develop heart issues including atrial fibrillation. Specialist refused to report these adverse reactions and told her she’d die of c ovid if she refused to take the second.
0	These people need jailed! Keep your poison to yourself!!
1	I would regret not taking the third boost considering how well everything went.
1	Can an antivaxxer explain that if the covid vaccine is a ‘depopulation bio weapon’ why are more non vaccinated people dying at a faster rate?
1	pfizer is effective!
1	What pandemic silences the worlds most qualified immunologist if they see problems with the vaccines? Even the inventors of the said vaccine!
1	I just pray that, when the government flips the switch, a Billion people don't just fall dead... ï¸
0	Today is January 31st, and the COVID “vaccines” are the DEADLIEST vaccines in US history
0	Stop taking the death shot.
0	Don't take the vaccine my mom suddenly died from a major stroke after having her C-19 shots. She was in perfect health prior.
1	I haven't died to covid. I don't know a single person who has.
1	Eww… get these antivaxxers out of here
1	I'll my shot. Would feel good to go out and not worry about getting sick. I can't wait for everyone else to get their shot so we can all hang out.
1	This is truly a huge achievement for the human race. This isn’t just about Coronavirus but it’s also about mRNA and the future of vaccines. We were confronted by a novel and deadly virus (relative to other respiratory viruses) and we poured money and resources into science AND SCIENCE WORKED. This is a true testament to science and what it can do for us.
0	Stop trying to force people to get the vaccine
0	I know the ingredients to a flu shot and it's literally nothing to worry about unless you have some sort of allergy to one of the ingredients. Again, TONS of people get these shots and are perfectly fine.
1	it is obvious you do not understand viruses or vaccines. And yes, the vaccines help prevent infection and have been shown to limit the possibility of long COVID.
0	Vaccines save lives
0	I used to think that there were many side effects from the vax, but now I realize the damage was the whole purpose of the vax.
0	She’s correct.. I’m happy my kids have never ever had any poison shots.. I love them
0	Quick, the 74729th booster should be handy enough to prevent you from getting it!
0	My gf and I have come to the agreement well get our kids vaccinated with the 6 or 8 vaccines they were doing in the 70s or 80s but nothing more
0	Never vaccinate your kids...
1	Health care worker here.  Thank you and thank you to everyone for wearing masks, social distancing and for getting vaccinated (when the time is appropriate).  We will get through this, together
0	So relieved that I didn’t crumble, I remained strong and do not have that poison in my body !!
1	Oh thank God for this honest man. He realized how bad the vaccines were and stopped recommending them.
1	Post-vaccine life's like unlocking a new level, everything's possible again, game on.
1	Standing with Dr. Fauci. Many deaths occurred unnecessarily because DJT ignored the Science. Dr. Fauci followed the Science & saved lives. Biden showed leadership. Lives were saved without using an IV drip of BLEACH. Follow the Science. Truth & Leadership Matters. 2024 Vote Blue
0	Poor man his wife is gonna suffer more because the jabs weakned her immunesystem
0	Like the shot works?.
1	I am so glad you got the vaccine! I got my 2nd dose (Moderna) today and so far so good.
1	Its necessary to get vaccinated for things like covid and the flu if you haven't got yours yet you probaly should
0	I'm so glad that I found a community who are against getting vaccinated. We are a rare few.
1	there’s millions of people dead from Covid on the planet, but an extremely low amount of people with genetic conditions dying from the vaccine makes the vaccine terrible?
0	You're hilarious if you think I'm taking even 1 single vaccine
1	Getting vaccinated is our best shot at ending this pandemic.
0	I got terrible permanent side effects from my second pfizer jab. Screeching loud tinnitus, clicking sounds in my ear, swollen thyroid, constant reflux type feeling and ear aches. If it wasn't for the media and govt con job, and mandates, I wouldn't have got it. I'm suffering. I would prefer to die from covid.
1	another one who doesn't get how vaccines work. They help you fight the illness so you don't die, so get vaccinated!!
1	This makes alot of sense actually. Understanding is only part of the solution though.
1	you have a lot to learn about vaccines, but I can help you out (I'm literally a scientist who develops them, so apologies if I come off as frustrated about this topic).  start off by reading up on herd immunity and why that is important.  but moreso, its because they are flat out wrong and there is insanely strong evidence to support vaccine's safety profile.  its really unsafe for a child to not be vaccinated with the large population we have now on Earth both for the child and for other children/elderly/immunocompromised people.  its not an ego thing, its just knowing facts.  it's like if someone is arguing to you that gravity doesn't exist or something, literally that scale of evidence exists for vaccines. many of the arguments, like Autism, are actually opposite of reality - not vaccinating your child leads to slightly higher rates of Autism.  I have a chronic illness that may have been prevented, maybe, if not for the original anti-vax movement - Lyme disease. There were numerous companies developing a vaccine at the time, and I would've gotten it as a child if they didn't get shut down because of the movement which was exposed as false at the time.  Now there is no vaccine (except for animals) and hundreds of thousands get that disease every year.  So its really trying to combat dangerous misinformation both to protect the public but also the individuals who believe in this fake stuff.  With how powerful the anti-intellectual and anti-facts movement is today, you have to be strong and stern with people who are willfully ignorant or woefully misinformed.  Its more about public health than anything else, and I pledged to protect public health as a pharmacist and I pledge my life to research and spreading knowledge as a scientist.  That might sound extreme or whatever but I do take that stuff seriously, so it irks me to my core to see uneducated people putting their own child and other people at risk because they don't accept or know the truth.  Its not that they are inherently bad people, but they are doing a very bad thing.  Its like if someone got in an accident with a passenger in their car and the passenger flies through the window and dies.  But they removed the seat belt from the passenger seat because they think it causes Autism because of a facebook post.  Are they bad?  I'm not sure, but I do know they are making a horrible choice removing that seat-belt.  They'll argue to the death because one person one time got hurt by their seat-belt being too tight during an accident, though.
0	My sister was lucky she just had a heart attack and had two stents put in after her 3rd one. I know of 6 people in my small circle who died.
0	I have so many friends that are unvaccinated , caught Covid and were fine
0	Not a single person that didn’t get the vaccine regret their decision
1	Taking the vaccine is like giving blood. Might feel dizzy and somewhat weird, but at the end you know that you did something to help
0	Side effects include bleeding anus, headaches, hair loss, loss of memory, joint pain, itchy eyes, nose bleeding, auto immune disorder, ringing in ears, high blood pressure, toe nail fungus, stroke, heart failure, cancer and death...ask your doctor if Vaxxlorass is right for you.
1	For anyone worried about how they'll feel after getting the vaccines - I know a lot of people who felt just fine after both their shots! I feel like people only hear about the bad experiences - you might not have any side effects at all, and even if you f
0	Scientists and doctors can be bought just as easily as politicians, don't trust what's in the so called vaccine
0	Every day that passes I am more and more convinced I made the right decision in not being jabbed
1	Amazing how professional and efficiently run Ontario's Covid vaccination centres are. Staff,  nurses & volunteers at Cloverdale Mall and Woodbine Centre have made it an actual experience to get a shot. Same across the province no doubt. Thank you @ONThealth and Team Ontario.
1	Just take the damn shot, how bad can it be
0	The coronavirus vaccine as a source of dangerous invasion #BreakingNews #Coronavirus #CoronavirusOutbreak #COVID19 #COVID #COVID_19
1	So incredibly grateful to have received the #PfizerBioNTech #CovidVaccine here @OSUWexMed!
0	I think most of us are over this, got 2 vaccines and have had covid 3 times. I dont plan on getting more vaccines.
0	I am starting to believe that covid vaccination is a propaganda.. 😬
1	Understanding the rigorous testing and approval process the COVID-19 vaccines underwent, I feel reassured about their safety. The transparency and rapid response of health agencies worldwide in addressing concerns and side effects only heighten my trust in the vaccination process.
1	I feel good about myself when I do things in the world that helps others live a brighter, better , happier day. I go to bed feeling like I had an awesome day.
0	I received the Pfizer vaccine on the 19th of March about a week later I had a few dizzy spells, then about three days later woke up and went into full blown vertigo. It is April 9 and still dealing with vertigo and lightheadedness if I move my head wrong. Also have very loud tinnitus in my right ear. I am hoping this isn't a permanent problem. I am going to cancel my second vaccine.
0	I know so many people who had injections and are ill now. I have a 23 year old female friend who had to go on BLOOD THINNERS just days after her first AZ shot (she worked with the elderly at the time). She had to get a second to keep her job, despite her injuries. I thank GOD every single day that I donot watch TV, listen to propaganda
1	After getting vaccinated I'm filled with hope for the future
0	Vaccine was a weakened virus insert to your body .. How can you know that the virus will not able active again and make your whole organ shut down by the virus .. stoopid vaccine
1	Great escape from pandamic
0	I didn't know Burlap was CEO of Pfizer, but it seems to make sense; the guy is a veterinarian in charge of human sniffles vaccines forced upon the masses.
1	Finally get some hope for the rest of the world, we stuck in this bad situation for more than one year and hope in vaccine can save people's live. UK is an important role in this event and hopefully get a good outcome.
1	I will not quickly forget the people who used fake propaganda to stigmatize vaccines, masks, and social distancing. I have no doubt it led to more deaths, and I blame them.
1	this is one thing that I just can't wrap my brain around. they refuse medical science solutions to mitigating COVID, but then they still come to a hospital when they get really sick and expect to be offered something else than solutions medical science has developed. like what do you want, the doctor to say a prayer for you and release you?!
1	My Husband and I, Both 68, took both vaccines and had no problem at all... I even helped on Valentine's Day at my daughter's flower shop. I had to get the second vaccine then.... I went right back to work and I never was sore or tired....
0	I'm not anti-vaccine, but I am cautious about this one
0	I'm still proudly unvaccinated. Sometimes I feel like I'm the only one I know who hasnt gotten it. I feel for those who were forced being in healthcare, travel or almost any other corporate job. I work for myself so I didnt feel pressured but I've lied when I went to a Dr. Or hospital. I just don't want to hear it.
1	"I got the Moderna vaccine yesterday around noon. They gave me a little in my left arm, and the vaccine didn't do anything. It's been 24 hours now, and luckily, I didn't have any symptoms."
1	Y’all anti vaxxers are a MESS. Grow tf up
0	Imagine these vaccines don't work on incoming variants, and WHO has to make another vaccine and all those fully vaccinated still need another dose lmao the business keeps going
0	Trump: The vaccines will be ready before election Fauci: Am I a joke to you? Trump: Yes
0	it's pure poison.
0	Happy to be unvaxxed
1	Wanna show gratitude to masks, all three of my vaccination jabs, and my extremely introverted personality for getting me thru year 2 of being covid free. Here's to hopefully continuing the trend in 2022!
0	I'm glad I trust my gut feeling, the pharma industry is absolutely evil. I have companies still denying me just because I'm unvaccinated, its crazy
0	I'm still trying to find out if my very low risk of a severe case of COVID-19 is worth the risk of a completely new vaccine technology.
0	The need for booster shots raises questions about the effectiveness of the original vaccine, which makes me question its long-term efficacy.
0	I don't believe in this at all. We don't have enough validation.
0	King Charles was just diagnosed with cancer, I wish him well; my dad passed from cancer and I wouldn't wish it on anyone. However, cue the anti-vaxxers who will definitely blame this, on the COVID vaccine.
1	That moment when science and technology saved us all by creating amazing Vaccines!
1	At first, my mom was hesitant to get the vaccine. But when I had covid just last yr September, she immediately took it after the quarantine
0	I've heard that the COVID-19 vaccine can cause serious side effects, like myocarditis. I'm not willing to risk my health for a vaccine.
1	i'm so glad you got the vaccine! i have barely left my house this past year and got it last week as well, better days are coming <3
1	The benefits of getting vaccinated far out weight the potential risk or side effects
0	Those people who did not get vaccinated are happy there's plenty of people that got the vaccination who are not
1	I just came to say "F*ck anti-vaxxers."
0	I'm jelly. Got two jabs before I realised it was a scam. At least I've woken up now. Won't be getting another thats for f'ing sure.
1	Antivax Parent: "I'd Rather have my kid die than have autism"  Kid not getting the vaccine: "But mother, i'd rather not die."
0	I got myocarditis after the first Pfizer shot. That shot is poison
0	I'm sorry... As a lay person I don't like the idea of hijacking my cells and turning them into spike protein factories.   Don't like the idea of that at all.
0	Well the vaccine doesn't work. People gets breakthrough infections
0	The 'cv19vaccines' are leaky & have dangerous side effects as per UK yellow card system
1	Trust the Science and get the vaccine.
0	High blood pressure
0	The vaccine bullshit is done. Either you got it or you didn't i don't care either way. I made my choice (non vaxxed, almost lost my career) and live with it without regret. The only reason I would think someone would continue to drag this out is they got vaxxed against their wishes. Sorry bud, you always had a choice, you were just too scared to risk the stakes.
1	I always loved arguing with clowns on this subreddit who all somehow knew 2-3 people personally who died from the vaccine despite the odds being something like 1:15k. They were all just insanely unlucky I guess.
0	Just the fact that you can't sue drug companys makes me not want to take the jab.
1	"I already got the second dose, and everything is great."
0	I don't trust the rushed development process of these vaccines.
1	People who talk bad about the vaccine doesnt know how much time and dedication was given to it.
0	Please keep all of your records. Never can we let the bastards who forced these jabs on people, knowing they were not safe, nor the practitioners who did not care enough to advise their patients to avoid this injection, get away with saying “we didn’t know the harm they could cause”. We knew - they knew.
1	Yes! My mom has covid and I've had to take care of her for weeks and I still haven't gotten sick, she's toward the end of her sickness so 🤞🏼 ❤️ Not sure if it's just my disinfecting abilities and masking, but I'll take the vaccine as a win too :') I don't want to get that sick like she is with covid, it sounds insufferable
0	Be careful the FDA recently just released a statement about a correlation with increased stroke risk if you have gotten the flu vaccine and the Covid shot close together
0	Whooping cough killed approx 5,700 children a year in the early 1900s until these 3 women worked overtime to develop a vaccine
0	Don’t let them scare you or force you to get mark !!!
1	For the love of everything if you have access to the vaccine take the advantage and get it. Encourage others to get it as well
0	Someone who was perfectly healthy then had 3 heart attacks and other symptoms . It is perfectly reasonable to assume it might be a vaccine injury.
1	No need to spread false information. I’ve had flu vaccines for years now and recently the covid vaccine and I’m absolutely fine. And I know in the future I will be fine too.
0	“Trust the science”“Okay let me see it” “Sure thing I’ll show you in 75 years”
0	Get vaccinated they say??? The results will have you feeling……well if your going to get the poison you decide on how they make you feel???
0	A child in our neighborhood died of myocarditis, only a few days after the Pfizer. It was horrible.
0	Glad I took the risk of refusing all of these "vaccines" despite pressure even from within my own family
1	I've been saying for years that the only reason anyone in a first world country would be against vaccinations was because they were raised in a world that benefited from them in the first place. If they had watched people suffer at die due to these diseases they would be singing a different tune. Glad to see this getting traction. Hopefully more will follow his lead.
1	I'm proud to be vaccinated and encourage everyone to get their shots too. Vaccines are our best defense against debilitating diseases and allow us to enjoy a higher quality of life.
1	anti vaxxer: my kid got autism after he was vaccinated, that proves it! Me: I hurt my elbow after drinking water, that proves it!
0	The risk is not worth the benefit. That is why I did not have my tween boys get the shot. They already had natural immunity. They didn’t even get that sick with COVID. This was during the delta outbreak.
0	100% safe from side effects, 99.98% safe from COVID death. I think I’ll stay unvaccinated. Let’s Go Brandon!
1	Got 2 vaccinations, then Corona & couple days ago my booster. Should be good now right😂
0	Yeah the shot gives you a damn blood clot
1	Vaccinated and proud! Grateful for the opportunity to contribute to herd immunity.
1	This vaccine cannot get to New York fast enough.
0	It’s not worth risking taking vaccination. It’s worse than coronavirus itself.
0	Its safe to trust your immune system
1	it doesn't matter, you can provide scientific evidences to them, they won't change their minds at all. They're just like religious fanatics, they'll keep believing in their delusions, even if you show them facts against their beliefs. It's no wonder why those two groups usually overlap.
0	Thé only vaccine I need is the Blood of Jesus.
1	"My grandmother already got it, and it only hurt where they applied it, and she felt tired, but she's fine now."
1	God I can’t wait. Once my kids are vaccinated I can be a human again.
0	We as unvaccinated were doing just fine until vaccine roll out started globally. Today, two thirds of Americans are unfortunately injected with mrna shots. Our loved ones are injected and so many people are asking me how to detox from the vaccines. Doctors are recommending Ivermectin as an essential drug to give power our body to detox. You can get ivermectin to detox your body by visiting getmeivm.com
0	These side effects are not rare. They are underreported.
1	Feeling a bit sore at the injection site, but no other issues.
0	This "doctor" called Sherri Tenpenny also thinks that if take the COVID vaccine, you will be able to break the physics and make a brass key magnetic, and it'll stick into your arm.
0	So glad I was able to resist the pressure to get injected with that garbage.
1	I just got the J&J vaccine and had felt really bad for a day tiredness, chills, and fever but in the end I am still here with no major complications.
1	I'm very pro vaccine. I get all six of my kids vaccinated. I believe vaccines save millions of lives, and people ought to be getting vaccinated.
1	Proud to be part of the solution. Vaccinated and feeling good
1	A friend and her husband both were fully vaccinated, when their son got severe case of covid. Their daughter also tested positive, but with no symptoms. Friend and her husband tested negative. That shit works!
0	Shame on everyone who coerced or pressured people to take that shot.
1	Just got my third shot! Boost me up!!!!
0	What is long turn side effects, it need a lease 2to3 years to show
0	My mother was healthy with mild arthritis before the "vaccine". After the vaccine and the subsequent booster shots she developed pneumonia Parkinson's severe rashes and full-blown arthritis!!! She was a strong healthy woman now 3 years later she is wheelchair-bound in a nursing home!!!
1	Any Body that got the vaccine, I'm following you!
0	I'm not sure if the vaccine is safe for pregnant women or individuals with certain health conditions.
1	Do you know about herd immunity? It's sort of the entire principal vaccination is based on. It's pretty cool.  If the disease can't find a suitable host before it is no longer transmissible it means that the the herd becomes immune to the disease. When enough people are vaccinated transmission of the disease becomes impossible. Vaccination has killed off diseases like cow pox, small pox, and more.  So go get your shot so we can hit herd immunity and we can all hang out.
1	Got my first jab today and somehow immediately decided that now is the time to scare myself to death by exploring the side effects. By the way, I've had no soreness, no nothing so far. Yay.
1	I love when you point to studies but they say those studies are wrong.Like there is always a risk. But the risk is very low overall
1	I don't understand the people who use the "government bad" excuse. The government is the reason why you can express your opinion on the internet in the first place.
0	The effect of the vaccine is mainly reflected in psychological treatment.
1	I believe in the COVID vaccine and am fully vaccinated + boostered.
0	48 hours post-2nd-vax Still achy & exhausted. Fever, but lower than yesterday. The lymph node above my left clavicle is still swollen & painful, and I woke up with swollen & painful lymph nodes in my left armpit. The nodes hurt worse than the injection site. GOOD TIMES #Moderna
1	This makes me so nervous for my second dose
1	More evidence from SA that Omicron is milder for those who have a previous infection or double vaccination. Better to get your immunity from vaccination as it also protects against long covid. Too bad for the recalcitrant unvaxxed.
0	I had 2 Moderna’s and have still not recovered fully from them, never felt soooo sick in my entire life and still feeling generally unwell
0	Vaccines have risks, and I'd rather not take that chance.
1	Had the vaccine, no issues, and proud to be part of the solution. Vaccines are a gift to humanity. Choose science over fear!
1	lets fight against the covid! join hand! lets overcome this
1	COVID-19 vaccines can help prevent you from becoming hospitalized if you do get infected with COVID-19.
0	I got the jab…worst decision of my life. Ever since I got it I have had health problems such as a chronic cough, chest pains and regurgitation. Anyone else feel similar?
0	Vaccines are just a way to make our kids sick and dependent on meds.
0	My mother told me " Never take drugs from convicted felons with legal indemnity . "
1	Fully vaccinated with AZ.  And now we won’t die of covid.  That’s pretty fantastic.  And an opportunity many people didn’t get. Get your vaccines people - to quote someone wiser than me: ‘the best vaccine is the one you can get now’
1	Hoping praying this vaccine works and we go back to normal
0	I and my family lost everything for saying NO. Our jobs, our money, our house, our family, our friends, and people still treat us like leppers. But we DON'T mind, we are all healthy, we are all alive, we all have had Covid with no serious health effects, whereas many we know now are dead, dying, or have serious life changing side effects. NEVER FORGIVE NEVER FORGET
1	Got vaxxed! It's a whole vibe
1	As a responsible citizen I think we need to listen to the doctors and get vaccinated
0	I'm staying in the Control Group. No jab with endless boosters!  Clot shot. No Thanks. Immunity from my system.
0	I had a lady that worked at Pfizer Manufacturing them tell me and she didnt elaborate but she said do not get it and def. Dont give it to your kids.
1	The vaccine isn't just about avoiding illness; it's about reclaiming our lives. Can't wait to enjoy the simple pleasures again safely.
1	I will continue to get shots and boosters. I caught a new variant of Covid that the vaccines and boosters were not specifically designed for, and it kicked my butt! Without the immunizations/boosters I likely would have been hospitalized.
1	Stab me with that needle please!
1	People before the new vaccine: ugh wish companies would develop a vaccine faster. Companies: develop a vaccine faster. People: now I don’t want it
0	Vaccine are pure poison
1	Vaccinated! Feels like a step in the right direction.
1	I’m grateful that I live in a place and during a time when vaccines are readily available.
1	I'm so grateful for the COVID vaccine. It's our best tool to end this pandemic and protect our communities.
1	I just got my booster. Then got covid. I am perfectly fine and was sick for 2 days. Obviously I felt good but quarantine because still contagious.
0	I support people's decision to not take any covid vaccine
0	If vaccines where safe, the manufacturers shouldn't be shielded from lawsuits
1	I got vaccinated as soon as I could, and I'm so glad I did. The vaccine has kept me safe from COVID-19, and I'm able to live my life without fear of getting sick.
0	30 million deaths from vaccine and counting
0	I've yet to get the needle for anything covid related
1	Does everyone remember the polio outbreak? I bet you all got the vaccine when you were little. How do you think it was eradicated?
0	10 years down the line: "Who knows what the long term side effects are? Just give it another 10 years" 20 years down the line: "Who knows what the long term side effects are? Just give it another 10 years" 30 years down the line: "Who knows what the long term side effects are? Just give it another 10 years" 40 years down the line: "Who knows what the long term side effects are? Just give it another 10 years"
0	All of you who are so adamant on not vaccinating yourself and your kids, hope you go extinct due to preventable diseases like polio and pox so that rest of vaccinated population can live happily
1	I will be getting the vaccine asap. My parents are both in several high risk categories. I have been so scared for them and want to protect them as much as possible.
1	I spent about 7 days in the ER due to Covid and I haven’t been vaccinated personally it’s changed my mind about getting it I’m nervous but it felt like I almost died from it and I’m only 26.
1	Thanks for everyone who commit themselves to make the covid-19 vaccine! ️
1	Damn this is so impressive. Hail Science!
1	I was quite reluctant to take the vaccine, but after this I'll definitely consider it and I'll be sure not to take it anytime soon since I have exams and wouldn't want to risk anything. Thanks for this💗
0	Wow I've never had any of the variants. Never took a shot..hmmm?
0	So relieved that I didn’t crumble, I remained strong and do not have that poison in my body !!
0	Haven't had a vaccine in 6 years, I recommend we quit vaccines for less threatening diseases.
0	I'm not an anti-vaxxer but a vaccine developed in 6-12months is a NOOOOO from me
0	Lost a HEALTHY 45 year old nephew who had a heart attack while walking his dog, 3 days after he got the jab. His girls were devastated. Just read  In the first nine months of this year, 158,000 more Americans died unexpectedly than in all of 2019. Actuarial reports that young people are being disproportionately affected here. Mortality was 26 percent higher among insured 35- to 44-year-olds and 19 percent higher for 25- to 34-year-olds.
1	New York state is keeping weekly infection rates on vaccinated and unvaccinated people. While there is significant infection among vaccinated, the rate among unvaccinated is many times that of vaccinated:
0	As a nurse, witnessed people who have experienced blood clots, myocarditis, serious autoimmune issues following the shots, the doctors will not admit it's the shots and leave the person stranded. It's so awful, I can't recommend them (nurse).
1	Vaccines are great for young people with strong immune systems. They are significantly less effective for the elderly and newborns and the immuno-compromised.So if you get a nice thick herd immunity of healthy people surrounding the immune-weak, you can avoid sudden rampant disease spread into - say - retirement homes or daycares, which spike the incidence of illness for everyone. Also, keeping rates of spread low reduces the incidence of mutation and the chance for a given virus to evade the current vaccination protocol.This isn’t an individualist problem. Either we all immune together or we all get variants separately.
0	I and my family lost everything for saying NO. Our jobs, our money, our house, our family, our friends, and people still treat us like leppers. But we DON'T mind, we are all healthy, we are all alive, we all have had Covid with no serious health effects, whereas many we know now are dead, dying, or have serious life changing side effects. NEVER FORGIVE NEVER FORGET
0	Pericarditis (inflammation of the lining outside the heart, very rare)
0	My daughter, a nurse at the AP-HP, on the vaccine ”Ah ah ah! They don't evendream about it, they start with the old ones so that we can attribute the side effects to age”.
1	"I was in the Marines but was discharged because I didn't want to get the vaccine" is legit the lamest military story ever.
0	Both my mother and step mother died shortly after 2nd booster a month apart . Can't believe these two are gone now! Very lonely!
0	gonna have a shot this season? you are the clinical trial. thanks for your help!
1	Want to travel, vaccinated for safety and peace of mind
0	You're downplaying the risks of vaccines.
1	Getting vaccinated is a personal choice that can have a positive impact on the entire community.
0	You are talking about me! 67, covid vaccine 2-15-21. Two weeks after shot, I was sick, migraines, blackouts, fainting tachycardia. I suffer so bad , I drop like a stone, where ever I am. Causing injuries to my face, shoulders, cracked tailbone. I hold the walls wherever I go. I have 15 years of medical history, of a perfect heart, 120/60-70, no high pulse. Now I’m damaged. At 67, I’m mad!
1	Looking forward to receiving the vaccine.  I believe it will reduce my already low chances of severe illness.  And it will greatly reduce my chances of getting sick at all for about 3-4 months.
1	I can’t believe some  people who need a transplant would rather die than get the Covid vaccine. Like … huh 😂
0	7 dead in my circle of friends who were perfectly healthy before this poison was put in them !
1	Immunisation is giving people the antibody, vaccination is giving the weakened form of the virus so the body can then generate antibodies and generate immunity against the real virus, and once people have had the virus they are immunue.
0	My mom had 2 stokes after getting that poison and then a year later died!
1	First dose of the COVID-19 Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine! Do your part, get the vaccine if you are offered it!
1	My grandma refused to get vaccinated and died of covid
0	i know we all have our own opinions but for me i wouldn’t take it
1	Pro-Vax here
1	Great news! Dr. Tam has announced that a COVID-19 vaccine booster for young children in Canada (5-11) has been approved.  💉💉💉
1	I still feel sorry for her and I wish her husband a full recovery. Please get vaccinated. Don’t wait until is too late.
0	Never will I get it. Quite simply, feck that shoot
1	Parents who don't vaccinate their spawn should face criminal charges.
1	While I wasn't doubting the vaccine, this cleared up my confusion on the differences between the vaccines and that they work. I really appreciate these facts. We're almost there!
1	I'm sick of all these misinformation and anti-vaxx propaganda about the COVID.
1	In Bangladesh we are struggling because we don't have enough vaccine to immunize such a large population. Thankfully My family and I live in the capital (Dhaka) and we were able to get the 2 doses and my parents who are elderly in their late 60s got the 2 plus the booster. I am almost 38 and the other 3 of my siblings are still waiting to get the booster. Looking at the USA (for better or worse, the world always tend to follow what happens in the USA) it saddens me that these people are being stubborn and very selfish with the sense of entitlement is mind boggling.
1	Yeah, people worried about the vaccine having a gps tracker while they carry around their phone
1	I'm kind of laughing at the lack of unvaxxed representation in the Australian death stats this year (2022).
0	Zero shots and I feel great
0	Safe? Highly effective? In what reality?
0	Stay safe. Stay away from anyone pushing the jab!
0	Vaccination feels rushed. I'll stick to natural immunity. #NaturalImmunity #NotConvinced
0	"We don't know how long natural immunity lasts" gets a jab every 6 months
1	Took the shot…got covid
0	This aged so well. Even my elderly parents are like “no more vaccines”. They blew all the belief in the medical establishment in 2 years…
0	This documentary sickened me to my core. And further convinced me that I would never take it. Well done to Nazarin for standing up for herself.
1	You are going to do great! You got this.
0	Wow. It’s 2024 and some people still believe C-19 was real and that the jabs and boosters were actually vaccines.
0	I've seen documentaries exposing the vaccine cover-ups. Terrifying stuff!
0	The COVID vaccine was in IQ test - sadly many people failed and many were unscrupulously co-erced into taking the shots under threat of losing their employment. Everyone in government, the public service and the medical profession that promoted the COVID vaccines and boosters should be forced to get the booster shots every 6 months for the rest of their lives - however long or short that may be.
1	Y'know I'm glad there are doctors taking the time to educate people about the vaccine
0	I recieved Pfizer 1st/2nd and Moderna booster... My symptoms were sever chills, muscle/joint aches, moderate headache and fever... Couldn't sleep for 2 days
0	Lol so much misinformation and straight up propaganda in this video. Yikes
1	First time I see people being more afraid of a cure than the actual virus
0	I will NOT be part of this mind controlling operation in any shape or form
0	I am scared to take it because this vaccine is not tested and have unusual side effects
1	"They administered it 2 days ago, and it was the worst night of my life. I had a high fever, chills, headache, and body aches. Thank God, it was only that night."
1	Only bad thing coming out of this for me is the fact that it’s a needle, I hate needles but it’s worth it
1	Got the vaccine, still somehow got the ‘rona, I have a trash immune system as is so luckily it turned out to be a mild case, GET THE VACCINE.
0	My body, my choice. I choose not to vaccinate
1	Pfizer do wonders!
1	A couple of shots in the arm to potentially save your life is better than dying
1	As covid-19 variant spreading faster which one would you get, the vaccines or thoughts and prayers?
0	Nah bro not taking that poison
1	I love how everyone is so fixated on the long term effects of the vaccine, when they don't even consider the long term effects of being infected with covid.
1	The answer is, yes, get vaccinated. Be smart and save your friends life.
1	Vaccines are effective
0	As a nurse, witnessed people who have experienced blood clots, myocarditis, serious autoimmune issues following the shots, the doctors will not admit it's the shots and leave the person stranded. It's so awful, I can't recommend them
0	I am not getting it, no hate to u though for getting it
1	He trusted the government, like we all did. Scary stuff when you can't trust the cdc and government.
1	I don't understand why so many people are concerned about the possible long-term effects of the vaccine and not the possible long-term effects of the virus. It makes no sense.
1	"It's a small effort for a significant impact on global health."
1	Here in Thailand, we barely have any vaccines, people are desperate to get vaccinated, and less that 10% of us are vaccinated. It feels very unfair that Americans just shoo it away when so many of us would have it in a heartbeat.
0	Someone who was perfectly healthy then had 3 heart attacks and other symptoms . It is perfectly reasonable to assume it might be a vaccine injury.
1	Vaccine is the solution... NOVUS ORDO SECLORUM
1	Unvaccinated people are out to destroy humanity.
0	Vax rage, or spaced out people are things no one is talking about. People driving crazier than before,  more accidents, and on the I there hand, those who can no longer function.
1	Just got my shot. Feeling a mix of relief and excitement. Can't wait for the day when 'social distancing' is just a distant memory.
0	Thank GOD I didn’t get jabbed. Feel terrible for all the trusting individuals who thought they were doing the responsible thing. So sad
0	This is the first time in history where people are more scared of the vaccine than the actual virus... omg guys i got the vaccine now im magnetic
0	I still haven’t gotten any Covid Vaccines
0	It blows my mind how many people actually took the jab. It was so obvious what was going on...
1	It is safe, it's just a modification of existing vaccines
1	Feeling optimistic about the future thanks to the vaccine.
1	We are waiting for the vaccines, please make it as soon as possible. We need now... many people are dying everyday,,, ONLY VACCINE Could help the world and we back to normal again... NO more tears and struggling.
0	I'll wait till the vaccine's been around a bit longer.
1	If I got a covid vaccine AND Ruby Rod as a roommate, I'd have two good gifts that would keep on giving.

0	was take 2 yrs ago moderna vaccine, now diagnosed me a decease it called Myastania Gravis (Ocular)
1	I love vaccines and the things they have done for humanity. My only concern is the synthetic lipid layer that holds the RNA in this new type of vaccine, which if I'm correct never existed in other vaccines? If you have any info on it, please reply below, it would make me less worried to know more.
0	So how does the message sequence stop the spike protein from repeating process multiple times and what is the estimated time sequence remains in manufacturing mode?
0	I find the notion of being controlled by a vaccine a bit unsettling.
0	As a medical professional, I can tell there are a lot more of these injuries than are being admitted.  There is the potential for a tsunami of unintended consequences in the coming years.
1	I've had 4 COVID shots. Aside from an occasional bout of sinusitus, I've been healthy as an ox. I am also thrilled to say I haven't come down with either the flu or a cold since the COVID pandemic started.
0	Every single person I know regrets taking it and said they will never take another one..come one people the government cares about you.
1	Yes, I will be taking it as soon as it is available to me. I know it's a brand new vaccine but I trust that those who made it used good science despite the short time frame.
1	This hashes up to, VACCINATE YOUR CHILDREN
1	I'm baffled at how much people are disliking the video and saying that vaccines are harmful IN THIS CENTURY
1	ust got my third shot! Boost me up!!!!
0	Common sense/the grace of God kept myself and my family from being convinced, bribed, coerced, frightened, and shamed into getting it. And they did try all of that..
0	The whole conversation around COVID vaccines seems more politically driven than focused on actual public health concerns.
0	THANK GOD I DID NOT GET THE VACCINE
1	Anti vaxxers are just like flat earthers, brain dead.
0	I'm still glad I'm unvaccinated!
1	Good news
0	Muscle pain
0	Vaccines are a cash grab for Big Pharma. Wake up, sheeple!
1	When micro organisms and virus’s become a natural disaster that we can only try and stem the tides of. We adapt or die. Such is life. It’s not fair and never will be. We create a vaccine to kill them or they kill us and most likely die trying. #COVID19
1	Today I was lucky enough to get vaccinated against #COVID19. I did it not just for myself
0	if you want to protect yourself from covid just get infected with covid to be protected yourself from getting covid
1	Very happy! Got 4 and plan on getting a fifth soon.
1	Vaccines are the light at the end of the tunnel. Let's all do our part to reach it.
1	I'm getting mine.
0	My mother died of a stroke after her second vaccine. She’d never had a stroke before.
0	My friend's 65 year old father died suddenly 10 days after his first shot. Only preexisting condition was he was taking Heparin. Autopsy was inconclusive and done 15 days after his death because their were so many other deaths......
1	I was as sick after this COVID booster as when I had COVID in March of 2020, before the vaccines. I didn't take Advil in case it compromised developing immunity until the next day, and I was still terribly sick. I recovered after two horrible days and now I can live my best life! I'm so grateful for these vaccines!
1	This is a game changer for the world. Lower costs, easier storage requirements. A bigger milestone than Pfizer/Moderna vaccine approvals of past weeks. Eager to see US trial wrap up and FDA give their approval next month, so we will have enough supply to vaccinate general public.
0	Not talking about the blot clots and heart attacks… it’s wild people would get anything the government tells them to
0	I am so glad I never took those covid shots. I have no regrets
0	Remember kids.. Just Say No to drugs!  Say no to peer pressure. You don't have to put anything in your body that you don't consent to.
0	the first covid vaccine I got gave me heart palpitations, no thanks.
0	Pure blood here, keep the faith No vaxxers
0	Oh they do more than suspect.  They know.  Even here in Californian doctors will tell you that.  The doctors I go to will tell you they have had patients die from the shots.
1	I could easily win the debate between me and 700,000 dead bodies
1	This was helpful. I'm so tired of the anti-vaxxers out in full force, protesting in the streets!
1	if we have rules that force to, for example, not walk around naked, we should also have rules that force you to vaccinate and therefore not to spread preventable disease
0	Shut up you apes. I can’t believe you WANT lockdowns and mandatory injections. Please remove yourselves from the gene pool.
1	getting mine this week coming
1	I’m one of the people who chose to get vaccinated.
0	Omg the new Myocarditis 3.0 is here!  Better get my 8th booster
0	Nope, don’t need it I actually take care of myself
1	In conjunction with Griffin Hospital #Moderna vaccines available! Tomorrow, Wednesday April 14th. No appointment necessary. No proof of residency necessary.
0	The spike protein is the silent killer since it destroys the T-cells which is your only defense against all illnesses. The media, including Yahoo, are controlled by the Pharma Cartel, especially the corrupt CDC which receives the bulk of their funding from Big Pharma. I know of 7 people who are dead from the shots and the insurance actuarial tables paint a grim picture of a 280% increase in deaths since the launch of the untested shots.
1	How do we convince them to vaccinate, then?
1	I have been fortunate, gotten all my vaccinations, always wear my mask indoors.  Never had Covid. Somehow, 10 days after my latest booster in October I came down  with a cold, Rapid tested negative 3 days in a row.  My daughter suggested a PCR test, so I did, on the same day my Rapid test said negative.  Through that weekend I had my cold, recovered easily, then, after 8 days my PCR came back Positive for Covid!  By then I was testing negative Rapid test again.  I had the mildest possible Covid case.  I am thankful for the booster that probably allowed an easy case of Covid.
1	Vaccine booked Monday night
1	I would like to thank the 31 million people who won’t take the vaccine. That is 31 million who will get it sooner .
1	Anti-vaxxers have got to be some of the dumbest people on the planet.
0	Sorry I will not get it. Have not had flu or a bad cold in 20+ years. Have not had shots either.
1	I got both doses last year. For the first shot, my arm was just sore for a day. The second dose was a little bit unpleasant.
0	My husband have been a nurse for 18 years and I don't want him to get the shots. I ask my 4 kids if they would like to have the shots and they also will not take it. Our body our choices.
0	Where could I find a fake vaccine card
0	It’s really annoying that so many ppl think they’re an epidemiologist/medical expert when it comes to COVID vaccination. Who raised you?!?!
0	Vaccine is false sense of security. All about $. Covid been waaay overblown since beginning. It's nature weeding out excessive population. Black Plague in Europe wiped out 100+ million. Over 8 billion currently on planet. Wiping out a few billion would improve quality of life.
0	I had so many family members try to tell me that I was reason that COVID persisted because of not getting vaccinated. They are not saying that now.
0	if people wont be told, then sod them. they made their bed, they can lie in it. myself i didn't have 1 of the rushed experimental  jabs and done fine without but if you want to keep putting that crap in your body, its your choice, feel free, hell you can even have mine.
1	My pharmacist recommends wearing a mask even with the jab. Good advice.
1	Fully vaccinated for Covid 19 the best gift of 2021 thanks to all who helped and test this vaccine
0	Im not being ignorant I just think that its no good. The vaccine is not proven to be working 100% yet and until then, count me out
0	By not taking the vaccine jab, I'm 100% safe from side effects and 99% safe from covid.
1	I have had COVID 4 times and it was terrible. I like to think those vaccines helped me. You have no idea what your saying. Was the virus man made? Maybe... but it was real and I'm alive thanks to those vaccines.
0	I had so many family members try to tell me that I was reason that COVID persisted because of not getting vaccinated. They are not saying that now.
1	If you don’t trust the vaccine then you probly don’t trust whoever is calling it safe or doing the tests to call it safe.
1	Yup. I was astounded at how the media ran with the meme that the J&J vaccine was much less effective. Especially when you factor in how easy it is to ship and store it, and you only need ONE dose!
1	I had the Moderna. All I had was a headache and very sore arm the first 24 hrs. I’ll be getting my second dose soon. So thankful to be able to receive it!
1	I will continue to get boosters as they become available.  I think that the Covid vaccine will continue to be modified as new variants arise.
0	All these “doctors” with no idea how disastrous these jabs (all of them) turned out to be. This is just shameless marketing so this thing gets its kickbacks from Moderna.
0	DOn't even worry about the countless cases reported to VAERS of blood clotting, seizures, inflammation of the testicles and ovaries, myocarditis, bells palsy, tinnitus, permanent residual brain fog, hearing loss, tinnitus, cancer, kidney failure, Guillain-Barre Syndrome (when your immune system attacks the nervous system), tumors/lesions under the skin... no big d
0	30 dying a day from the jab.....emails from nursing homes saying a third of residents died after receiving the experimental covid vaccine.
0	Nah, I'll pass on the vaccine. I trust my immune system more than some rushed shot.
0	My heart breaks for all the people who felt pressure to take the jab
1	It stung like hell and stung aftewards too, still worth getting vaccinated though
1	I take my vitamins, drink my tea and get a Covid booster once every 12 months.
0	I did not get the clot shot. The surgeon general of my state came out saying the shot is linked to blood clots and heart failure. I’m so glad I listened to my instincts and not the doctors trying to force me to take it.
1	I just got my first Phizer vaccine shot today! YAY!
1	I’m a nurse and getting mine this Friday. I’ve been getting lots of fear mongering articles from my conspiracy theorist mother (who is sadly... also a nurse). So I’m spooked, but I’m gonna go with science. I’m getting the Pfizer one which I’m happy about. I wanted to be vaccinated ASAP, and that one has shorter waiting!
0	My blood type is (O-) I don't smoke, I don't drink alcohol, I don't take drugs, I live in the Atlas Mountains in Algeria, every day I drink olive oil for lunch and dinner, I didn't get sick with corona and I didn't get vaccinated, and I'm happy with my choice
0	I was forced to get my vaccines by my mum because I was under 18. I never wanted ir, because I knew it was a terrible idea, and I'm blessed to of had zero effects, but seeing what's happened to others, I am terrified now. I wish I was like you all who never touched it.
0	“The vaccine should be tested on politicians first. If they survive, the vaccine is safe. If they don’t, then the country is safe.”
1	Community leader's vision, advocating for community-wide vaccination to halt COVID-19's spread.
0	people are so stupid and the gov is trying to bring the covid fear back
1	The eye roll I get when I recommend flu and covid vaccination at the end of my consults is really starting to wear on me.
1	Kudos for this video! Instead of shaming and manipulating people, you understand them. It humanizes the situation and puts science above all. Good job guys!
1	Please take care and be vaccinated.
0	I'm an old person, rarely get a cold, am on no meds. I rely on Jesus as my med.   And it works.
0	Why do they need a microchip in it?if it’s gonna cause any harm I don’t think we need it
1	Wooo! Glad I got Moderna.  I can still be the human sacrifice going to the grocery store since I'm the only one vaccinated.
1	I got vaccinated to protect my loved ones, my community, and myself. The more people vaccinated, the closer we get to defeating this virus. Let's encourage everyone to do their part and get vaccinated!
1	get protected by taking vaccination
1	Anti-vaxxers children shouldn't be allowed in schools, or any other places other children go. When I went to school in NYC in the 80s my parents had to show proof of vaccination or I couldn't attend. What the hell happened?
0	I am glad I watched this because it helped me realise that the shots are certainly unsafe.
1	I'm Canadian and myself and everyone I know have recieved the Pfizer vaccine. Canada is a major buyer of that
1	I'm 52 with stage 4 cancer. I just want to last a few years and enjoy them, not staying trapped in my house. I'll still mask up and distance but my health can't take the chance of catching it. I'm ok with taking the vax as long as it doesn't impact me majorly. I can deal with headache and short fever if it allows me to venture out with more safety.
0	I am unvaccinated and don't have any regrets.
1	Did my part, got vaxxed. It's about community, people!
0	100% regret it, my political views have also done a 180. If I could get it sucked out of my body I would. Fuck the government
0	The new vaxx-sin is "Safe and Effective "
0	You'll excuse me if I'm skeptical...
0	Since getting sick after my Twinrix vaccine in 1997. I started reading and researching more.
1	vaccine lead to healthy life
1	Score!!! My former barber who I tweeted about recently just texted me. He finally got his *first* #COVID19 vaccine dose today! I know it’s hard but we have to keep our compassion.
0	This happened to me! I got my first dose and a few weeks later I was hospitalized and my platelets were VERY low and my red blood cells were EXTREMELY high. The doctor said I wasn’t supposed to be alive. I had the Pfizer vaccine. I regret I ever got that shot.
1	Everyone I know that died weren't vaccinated !
0	The majority of the people I know did not get the Covid vaccine and haven’t died Brian so that’s a weak argument.
0	So glad I didn't get the vaxx, my kids would have lost their papa.
1	Got the shot. It's our best weapon against COVID.
0	It’s a very bad treatment. Ineffective and dangerous!
0	BE SAFE      DON'T TAKE THIS EXPERIMENTAL SHIT.
1	Nothing makes me madder than anti-vaxx fools.
0	Unvaccinated, NO symptoms = FIRED. Vaccinated, POSITIVE test = Come to work
0	I regret getting it man.. I regret it
0	I have not been vaccinated and never had Covid.
1	Go ahead, make covid adapt and make it stronger. Evolution
1	Safe, tested, proven, effective
1	Assalamualaikum and good morning semua! It's vaccine day today! Happy weekend!
1	I hope you’re right. I keep blocking anti-vax idiots on FB left and right. Nobody at work will wear a mask, they blame everything on Biden and the Dems. Half of my family members (most of dad’s side) are dumb country bumpkins against vaccines/anything a Dem would suggest they’ll do the exact opposite. I no longer speak to any of them. It really does seem like most people are against common sense measures like vaccines and it’s fucking sad and angering to see. Where the fuck are the sensible, science-believing people?
0	Can’t believe people still believe in covid
0	I am 42 years I haven't been vaccinated but my friends those who had  been vaccinated facing heart' blockage problem
0	Pretty much everyone is getting COVID, regardless of vaccination status
0	We lost all medical standards during the push to force failed toxic COVID-19 mRNA vaccines on the entire population including pregnant women and children
1	Imagine a world without vaccines. We would not be alive by today
1	Vaccines are a critical tool in preventing the resurgence of diseases that were once major health threats
1	I've spent probably 5000 hours researching books, articles, papers, stories, documents, history, films, talked to pediatricians, gastroenterologists, general practitioners, been to talks, talked with hundred of people and family and friends in detail about their experiences, talked to scientists, listened to scientists lectures online, and I've spent dozens or hours researching immunology in books and writing my own documents. I've also listened to the opposing view and articles from the CDC FDA and who, and all the vaccine proponents, and tend to get information about their honesty, claims, evidence, fraud and misconduct.  Don't fucking strawman and rehash bullshit blanket phrases and sentences I hear over and over by pro vaxxers, who probably just went to CDC and bought all the claims blindly without checking to see if they were credible or just pushed as credible because of the media being 95% against anti vaxxers religiously.  Guess what, many doctors, like Dr Richard Kelly, Dr Zimmerman, Dr Andrew Wakefield, Dr Suzanne Humphreys, and Dr Jack wolfson, used to be pro vaccines for a long time. And some doctors are now completely changing their minds and coming out against vaccines.  So, trust a pro vax doctor, and you might just be trusting a future ANTI VAX doctor.  You also want to know why theirs little doctors and scientists that are anti Vaccines? Well let's see, oh yes, all the ones that were were fired.. No shit there isn't many of them, they all got chucked away by the medical establishments and councils.  Seriously, open your mind.
1	One wonders how some individuals who are hesitant about vaccines still take birth control pills, which pose a higher risk of side effects.
0	I don't need vaccine, I am young. My chance of dying is like 0.000003%
0	Biggest mistake of my life was taking the shot to get my wife out of lockdown. 2 years later and I still have heart problems and thrombosis in my legs. F the entire medical mafia.
1	Any risk from the shot is WAY smaller than your risk of getting severe Covid
1	Got my second vaccine today and guys the side effects everyone is scared of are basically nothing
0	“COVID aware” is a strange way to say “coprophilia”.
0	Now they want to stop counting the cases. Because 65% of the positive cases of covid are in fully vaccinated people and some who've had boosters.
0	I personally know of four that died after their first jab. Two others now have rare cancers after their jabs. Must be climate change!
0	I'm glad my family doctor said I didn't need the vaccine
1	So many people who failed their science classes in school with negative opinions on this scientific breakthrough
0	Yes they are. I know someone who had all three shots and THEN caught COVID and died.
1	Moderna gave me a fever for 24 hours, but the real pain was in my arm. It felt like someone beat the absolute shit out of my arm with a baseball bat for about 2 days.  No regrets.
0	Thankfully someone is speaking about long vaccine injury. I have been suffering immensely since the first one and each one after. I took the first 2 and the first booster which nearly finished me off! My GP wouldn't have a word said about the vaccine and still won't even though I'm still suffering. Medical gaslighting is real folks, please try and stand your ground
0	"I'm hesitant about the vaccine due to potential long-term effects. Natural immunity seems safer to me."
0	vaccine-induced autism is real – don't let them hide the evidence!
0	I'll never regret being unvaccinated.
0	At no time in history has the people forcing others into compliance been the good guys.
1	Vaccines teach your immune system how to create antibodies that protect you from diseases. Vaccines will help keep you healthy.
0	I am unvaccinated and don't have any regrets.
1	I've had 4 shots (I qualified early for a second booster). No regrets. Absolutely none.
0	I’m 41, not super young, but after booster, got pericarditis, now enlargement of left atrium and unregulated sinus rhythm
0	As an emergency nurse I’ve triaged patients with complications of this vaccine rollout.. I have told my workplace I’ll be resigning if and when it becomes mandatory..  and I don’t believe in coercion to take vaccines.. we are supposed to allow our patients to have informed consent and respect a patient’s decision, but we don’t have that ourselves….if you want it, have it, but don’t force those of us who have made the choice it’s not for us.
1	Just got BOTH the new Covid vaccine AND the flu shot today!
1	The vaccine is a huge step towards safety for us all
0	By not taking the jab, I'm 100% safe from side effects and 99% safe from covid.
1	assisting in vaccination campaigns to safeguard the public.
1	Been vaccinated and I lived. The second shot left me a little tired for a day and I had a sore arm. Compare that to COVID.
1	Vaccination is the cornerstone of ending this pandemic. Let's all participate.
1	Finally the vaccine is almost ready. I hope the World Health Organisation will be proud of the good news. We are almost close to normality.
1	I just got my first vaccine today. No side effects so far. Thank you to all the scientists and researchers around the world for making the vaccine available this early and thank you for this channel for spreading the science. Yes, it’s definitely OK to be smart. Science rules!!!
1	I got my first dose of Moderna yesterday and only had arm soreness, a bit more than a flu vaccine but back to normal now. Hoping the second dose is just as smooth
1	Ironic, because most pro-vaxxers don't understand herd immunity.  Only 50% of adults are up to date on their vaccinations, and vaccines wear off, which is why they suggest booster shots.  If vaccines wear off, and adults aren't getting boosters, we DON'T HAVE HERD IMMUNITY.  Yet diseases aren't spreading.  Explain that one.
0	But I know someone, who knew the brother in law, of a cousins friend, who died from the "vaccine ". clearly not safe!
0	Let’s all just agree we witnessed the greatest experimental trial study in human history. Ever body lined up like Guinea pigs when it wasn’t  necessary.
0	Risks you say? Well when businesses were mandating it for people to work without them knowing the risks. I'm just so grateful that I never took the vaccine even though I lost my 20 year career at a hospital. I'm still alive. Had covid 14 months ago . No problem. My symptoms were less than my friends that are vaccinated.
0	You're not going to wipe the floor with anyone. I'm sorry that you lack the cognitive ability to accept the fact that vaccines are safe and effective.
1	Covid vaccines are safe
0	I’m unvaxed, had Covid once in Nov of 2020. I go to the gym and work out with many other ppl. I play poker with 9 other ppl on the table shoulder to shoulder and pass things around each other and socialize with others for hours at a time… my immune system still works…
1	Got the 2nd dose of the vaccine about a month ago. I know it probably won’t change anyone’s mind. But I feel fine. I hope you all stay safe and get the vaccine. ️ It was nice to hug my family members again.
0	Just wait. Next time you have an unexplained headache, weird abdominal pains, limp dick, the clap, flat tire, just know it was because you got that shot.
0	By not taking the jab, I'm 100% safe from side effects and 99% safe from covid.
1	Had my booster a while ago with no problems. Happy to take the very simple measures the Government have proposed. Wear a mask, wash your hands and get vaccinated. It's really very simple…
1	The COVID vaccines are empirically proven to be effective.  Liars like Johnson caused needless deaths from COVID.
1	Congrats. Those vaccines helped saved a lot of lives.
0	Keep getting jabbed up people …. They won’t take me alive … pure blood
1	Took the vax and feeling fine!  No COVID, no flu, no bronchitis. Everyone is coughing. I'm not!
1	I'm happy for this world will come back to normal life thanks to the vaccine.
1	I have know many people who got the virus and is still haveing problems from it. And there edvience of blood cloting and worse from this virus. For hear what I say if you don't what to take the vaccine then don't do it if you don't want to wear a mask don't do it. And if you get sick because you didn't take the precautions that the health experts and the disease doctor know then I don't feel sorry for you
1	I got the vaccine 3 days ago. It’s good for me!
0	2 people passed in my family one after 2 dose , 1 after 15 days of first shot, both were healthy prior vaccination
1	Its sad that you had to explain vaccines
1	Vaccinated and proud to contribute to community immunity. My son and his wife had COVID, but we took precautions. Vaccination is the responsible choice.
1	I'm vaccinated. I have the Pfizer vaccines. I personally didn't experience anything other than my arm being sore with both vaccines
1	The vaccine rollout is a testament to human resilience and cooperation in the face of adversity.
1	Yes... I'm alive ... spent months in hospital as a child with pneumonia and have never been able to get past a cold without a chest infection. 8 days into my post vaccine and positive COVID result I'm starting to do ok. There's no way I would have made it though without...
0	Rather taking a shotgun shot than the vaccine shot tbh…
1	SputnikV welcomes J&J vaccine approval in the US. This is also another validation of Sputnik V pioneering technology as J&J vaccine is essentially a first shot of Sputnik V vaccine
0	Seriously considering investing in a high-tech hazmat suit to wear during flu season
1	Seeing the positive impact of vaccination worldwide
0	Stay away from the poison
1	Every vaccine administered is a step towards breaking the chain of transmission. Together, we can create a safer environment for everyone. #VaccineSolidarity
1	I got my first shot as soon as I found an open appointment and that was four days ago. I am getting my second dose on May 11th! Luckily finals will be over and I can feel like crap for a day or two on my own time.
1	Once a vaccine is out the timer is on for reopening. If you want to be protected take the fucking vaccine, if you want to accept the risk don't.
1	After getting vaccinated, I found myself more compassionate towards those who may have reservations or concerns about the vaccine.
0	My mother told me " Never take drugs from convicted felons with legal indemnity . "
1	Every antivaxer needs to delete their computer's virus protection.
0	Here’s Why The #JohnsonAndJohnsonVaccine Is The Worst of All 3! New reports have surfaced which indicate that the new Johnson & Johnson vaccine relies on #AbortedTissue. It's well known #Pfizer & #Moderna also use aborted fetal cells in their vaccines.
0	People have a choice... And not everyone wants to pump their body with something that they have no guarantees wont effect them negatively.
0	I actually tested positive for Covid even before I got my vaccine. Believe it or not, I was more sick from the vaccine than actual Covid. Since I work in healthcare and pay bills, I had to get the horrible vaccine so I can keep my job
1	Cried with relief that an RSV vaccine is approved! It's no joke. Staying in a crowded ICU with a brand new newborn is awful. But now that doesn't have to happen!
0	Hollywood pushed the vax hard. Look how many of them had died suddenly now.
0	Big Pharma companies are profiting immensely from these vaccines, and their financial gain makes me skeptical about the true intentions behind the vaccine push.
1	I'm 28 and should be getting dose 2 next month. I work in mental health care, so I'm lucky I'm so quick. My parents get theirs next week and I'm so so happy I'll be able to hug them again
1	Honestly... as long as the vaccines are universally available and highly effective, I'm done fighting with antivaxxers.  They tend to be pretty awful people; if they want to die to "own the libs," who am I to stop them?
0	Never would go near it…But as soon as I heard that the government was offering gifts and money to people for getting their shots, that’s when I knew. The government does not care about your well-being that much lol. Best case scenario, this whole thing was just a money grab scheme. Best case.
0	66 unjabbed never wore a mask. Great social life and travel over the last few years. Better health than ever.
1	Honestly... as long as the vaccines are universally available and highly effective, I'm done fighting with antivaxxers. They tend to be pretty awful people; if they want to die to "own the libs," who am I to stop them?
1	A small minority will suffer immensely and a finite number of cases will prove fatal. Seasonal flu has broadly the same description. A vaccine does not exist for CoVid-19 A vaccine exists for (some strains of) flu Big pharma are irritated by anti-vax rhetoric
0	Hey - if TEN mice say that this 18th booster is good to go & this doc says it'll work 'NICELY', it MUST be an offer to good to turn down then - right?
1	My second shot is tomorrow (26yo). I also have booked a flight three weeks after that to visit my parents just in time for Dad's birthday!! I have been feeling great relief for being partially immune, and can't imagine how much relief I'm gonna feel tomorrow
0	Glad I said no to the jab and stood my ground despite the challenges from friends and families. I don't trust the system, period.
1	I spent about 7 days in the ER due to Covid and I haven’t been vaccinated personally it’s changed my mind about getting it I’m nervous but it felt like I almost died from it and I’m only 26.
0	All of the anti-vaxxers out there I've got one message for all of you I salute you keep up the good work
1	"Only two things are infinite: the universe and stupidity, but I still have some doubts about the universe." -Albert Einstein The existence of the anti-vaxxer movement proves Einstein's point.
1	THEY WERE VACCINATED AS KIDS LIKE OMG
1	The big COVID vaccines reduce mortality, your overall risk of death *after infection.
1	You are literally a risk to the entire world population when you don't get. The only way vaccines truly work to eradicate viruses is by a largest percentage of the population getting it.
1	Call me crazy, but I’ve never had Covid sincethe vaccine came out
1	The problem was/is that people fail to understand that #VaccinesWork incredibly well for preventing DEATH & serious complications. Expectations of invincibility were overhyped and unreasonable. The key to remaining Covid-free involves;
0	Doesn't matter I'm not getting any of them, haven't gotten any of them still alive
0	I feel for the people who got the vaccine shot and had I’ll affects or died!
1	Whether you think the covid will function fully or not like he said the initial effects of the vaccine are going to be better than getting the actual disease.
0	Both of you explained the CV19 vaccine very well. Now could you please make a video about the advantages of contracting CV19 and what happens when you're body creates its own antibodies that's 10 times greater than the CV19 shot could ever produce? 👊🇺🇸🇺🇸💪
0	the problem is that it's still impossible to book an appointment for vaccine. The waitlist has always been full.
1	I Am so grateful to get my #Vaccine this noon. A million thanks to our incredible health care workers who have put themselves at risk for our people
1	I had all my shots. No regrets
0	So safe, the manufacturer needs to be absolved of any financial liability
1	How sad... such a waste....just get vaccinated.
1	I'm 27. Just got my second dose yesterday, don't feel great but it's livable. Please get it. We want this pandemic to end so we can 1work on the next crisis.
0	I didn’t get it because I don’t want to be a test subject to some vaccine we don’t know the long term effects of
0	the first covid vaccine I got gave me heart palpitations, no thanks.
0	People are dropping like flies
1	Vaccinated, feeling safer.
0	So, no data on anything other than limited sample around increased antibody levels - itself simply evidence that something was injected but other than that, no claims of absolute or relative risk reduction of anything... The great experiment continues, no doubt with a significantly similar population of takers at this point.
0	My daughters boyfriend lost his dad to a blood clot in his brain right after his second Pfizer jab. They found him on the floor one evening about a year ago. He had a horrible migraine for a week after the jab than died from the blood clot soon after. Obvious it was the jab. He was just 52 yrs old
0	...politicians would get saline shots and tell you it was the jab...
1	That's the whole point of vaccines, they build your immunity.
1	Phil and I both got Moderna, our 5G signals will forever be intertwined ♥️
0	Dear fellow purebloods. Stay strong
1	Vaccination is essential for global travel and a return to international normalcy.
0	For the people showing up late, covid vaccines turned out to not stop infection or transmission, yes it’s unfortunate
0	I never understood the idea of getting vaccinated because one is protecting others , because if you get vaccinated the vaccine is injected  in your system, to function in your system.
0	This is desperation. Their poison vaccine push isn't going as well as they hoped so they're looking for a reason to take it all by force. I just hope our servicemen & women remember their oaths when that order drops. I believe they will. Keep pushing. We're winning this fight.
1	Anti vaxxers: “But who is John Vann, MD, really? Has anyone actually met him? He’s an obvious crisis actor.” John Vann: “Actually, I have over a thousand patients in my 30 years of medical service that could vouch f-“ Anti-vaxxers: “OBVIOUSLY MORE CRISIS ACTORS.”
0	My kids and I won’t be taking it. The company that I work for can fired me if they want
0	vaccine is  very danger
0	So glad I never got this jab.
1	Congrats for the two scientists who won the noble prize in medicine this year(2023) for their novel technique of developing vaccines
1	Billions of shots have been administered and everyone is fine. It’s just the anti-VAXers who desperately want to be proven correct that continue to post this nonsense. You know, people like you.
1	I am unapologetically pro-vaccine. All vaccines.
1	I already had long COVID and now have COVID again. You don’t want this. Everyone who gets sick is chipping away at their health slowly but surely. COVID destroys your immune system and repeatedly infections don’t build it up or strengthen it at all. Avoid if you can.
0	I'm wary of the influence of pharmaceutical companies in the vaccine rollout.
1	So glad I go the jab! No regrets at all! Best thing to ever happen!  It looks like the general theme of this thread is such that if you’re indifferent, regret it, or have only mild support for it, you’re an evil fuck. This thread is the perfect example of a politically motivated echo chamber even though no one is mentioning politics. The assumptions are outrageous. OP asked a simple question and people are arguing. I got the first and got Covid 3 weeks later. I got the first booster and got Covid 3 weeks later. I didn’t get any other boosters and haven’t gotten Covid since. I’m not saying the jab gave it to me, because I don’t think it did. I just don’t think it protected me against Covid as it should have. And that’s it. Do whatever the fuck you want. It’s your body, right? Apparently, that’s only relevant if you agree with the hive mind.
0	I am unvaccinated and don't have any regrets.
1	Yes I'm glad I got the vaccine.Also, other than the 0.001% of people that had an allergic reaction anyone that regrets it is misinformed.
0	We're witness to the greatest crime against humanity ever seen
0	This is exactly why I've been sceptical about this vaccination getting into the market after 1 year. There hasn't been enough testing. Other vaccinations get tested for a much longer time.
0	"I got the first and second vaccine. After the second one, I felt very unwell, and to this day, I haven't been able to recover."
0	Finally!!!!! sanity is being restored by a responsible citizen....I know CNN will cry foul on this but it's victory to those that feels enforcing vaccine mandate is not democratic
0	Boris to take it first and wait a few months. Will still decline , I have an immune system
0	Natural immunity is the best protection when you are a normal healthy person. Just make your own choices if it comes to your health.
1	Pandemics don't care if you're American... or a kid... or Democrat.. or Republican. Stop being a dumbass. Get vaccinated!
0	big pharma is out to get us! Avoid it at ALL COST!
1	The vaccine should be tested on politicians first.  If they survive, the vaccine is safe.  If they don't, then the country is safe
0	What stops these guys from generating a pandemic like this and smile to the bank. Meanwhile, we still don't know the origin of COVID-19 till now
0	Six days after having my first Moderna shot it hit me out of the blue without warning.  Nausea, intense dizziness, involuntary muscle contractions that wouldn't stop, and fever. Moving the head for just small increments was almost impossible without experiencing intense nausea.  I did my best to avoid vomiting because I did not want to become dehydrated.  I knew I would not be able to hold anything down after that.  This went on throughout the night and well into the next day.  I slept for a solid two days off and on after that night.  Now I am eating again without much nausea, but the dizziness is still there lurking in the background.  After this, I am seriously rethinking taking that second shot.
1	It’s cool because when I had my 2nd dose I didn’t feel anything it really helped my immune system good
0	It was rushed and not tested properly.
0	Tested rigorously? They haven’t even existed long enough to be tested rigorously...
0	Yeah and now 1 M out of 1 Billion Vax'd are dead..and no one is being told out right the truth.
1	My mom told me a lady she works with is now “magnetic” after getting the vaccine. I tried to tell her that’s rubbish but she doesn’t listen.
1	The vaccine provides a sense of security and peace of mind, knowing that you are protected from the virus and reducing the risk of spreading it to others.
0	I'm glad I trust my gut feeling, the pharma industry is absolutely evil. I have companies still denying me just because I'm unvaccinated, its crazy
0	injecting foreign substances into your body is just plain unnatural. don't be fooled!
1	Not only did I just got my 2nd COVID-19 vaccine shot, I even got a Scooby Doo bandaid! Do your part folks!
1	Also, because there are less viral replications, that also reduces the risk of a mutation occurring!
0	This is the first time in history where people are more scared of the vaccine than the actual virus...
0	I won't take any shots. I didn't take the covid shot and stopped taking the flu shot 4 yrs ago. I'm 64 and will not take shingles shot or RSV one either. Lost all confidence in the CDC and FDA.
1	Don't get vaccinated, but don't go running to the hospital when you get sick either! Choice is yours!!
0	Ill stick with my natural immune system, thanks. I'll also take my chances with the afterlife over a tyrannical gov.
0	Why are we injecting aluminum into our bodies? It can't be good.
1	This kind of educational videos about the vaccines should be aired all over the world and over mass media so that we can finally not be so afraid of the vaccine and collectively have a positive attitude towards getting it and beating this pandemic
0	The scariest thing about the jab is that it stays in your body for as long as your alive, triggering all types of things that would have stayed dormant, neatly packaged away - protected by our natural immunity. Scariest part is that the person will never know for sure when it will trigger
1	If your child has an autoimmune disorder you should be PRO vaccine, even if it means not vaccinating that child. You need the healthy children around your child to be vaccinated so they don't spread these preventable illnesses to yours
1	My mother in law was one of the "the vaccine has a chip" people. They must've gotten the message that so does the phone you're texting me on, so now she's saying it changes your DNA. No word on how or why, of course.
0	Oh hell no !!!   I don’t like the follow the leader approach to getting the shots.  I’ve never had any shots or boosters.  I’ve had Covid and I believe like in the old days if you get and live thru it then your natural immune system will kick in.  My immune system still works !!!
0	I ended up getting COVID 3 times. I worked in healthcare, never got the vaccine...it was rushed through and "emergency authorized" without any clinical testing that's standard for other vaccines. I currently suffer from idiopathic vertigo, I'm tired and rundown all the time, my memory recall for words is hit or miss, my body is sore, like I've been doing physical labor all day, and I have an issue retaining what I just read.
1	I'm going to drive to a CVS in the most ignorant, backwoods antivaxxer town I can reach and walk right in for mine, no wait.
1	I am pro vaccine
1	I'd also just like to scream into the void: i have been able to work on developing the moderna vaccine (just as a lab tech, i don't know any inside info or anything) after i lost my music store job, and it feels so cool knowing that all our work has been successful and that i have gotten to be a part of something so important. everyone who is able, please get it.
1	I am very glad I decided to get vaccinated- I am chronically ill in several ways, including severe asthma and a haywire immune system. I know that I would be one to become severely ill or die if infected, despite being seventeen (fifteen when the pandemic started and sixteen at vaccination). I tracked providers near me for months and made my appointment the moment people "sixteen and up with additional health concerns" became eligible. I'm one of those patients that are on the edge, which I knew from the beginning. I really need to be vaccinated, but my body is on the precipice of not being able to handle it. I didn't realize how far I was leaning. I was pretty okay the night I got vaccinated- but the next day was horrible. I couldn't move without gasping in pain, and this is coming from someone with a very high pain tolerance. I was sweating buckets, I had no appetite, and I slept on and off all day. I felt worlds better the next day, in fact, I went in to work that morning. That afternoon was when my trouble really started. Hot, burning pain in my chest, the kind of pain that chokes your breath right away. Sometimes random, sometimes triggered by moving or speaking. My heart clocked in at ~140 beats per minute when sitting. I went through my day woozy, loopy, and tired. I told my parents I was fine, that I had been through worse. They believed me, until it became close to my bedtime, and they witnessed me gasp and cry out when I tried to lay down. It was eleven o'clock when my mom caved- and decided it was time to take me to the ER. I had myocarditis. Luckily, I responded well to an anti-inflammatory, but my immune system misfired and hurt me in the process. I'm getting my booster. I'm a few months shy of eligibility right now, but I'm waiting until they declare that 16 and 17 year olds are cleared. Everyone, my parents especially, thinks I'm insane, but I don't care if I get hurt again. I want to protect myself and my future quality of life. If I am choosing to vaccinate- and choosing it again- what excuse do the anti-vaxxers really have?
0	I just realized that even doctors can be dumb.
0	Not vaxxed and still kicking gang -------------> Like
0	Isn’t this the first mRNA vaccine ever approved for use in humans? And you all would get it, knowing it’s one of the most fast-tracked vaccines in human history? Use common sense.
1	If it makes you feel any better everyone I know who got the vaccine seems to be fine
0	Dr. Fauci is a fraud E I E I O And all the sheep believe that quack E I E I O With a flip flop here And a flop flip there Here a shot Second shots Mandated booster shots Dr. Fauci killed those kids E I E I O
0	My sister faced lots of issues from the next day of vaccination. So no to vaccine.
0	Fools line up for experimental shot that is not vaccine.
0	Just came back from getting my vaccine and I recommend to everyone
1	I'm in my 40s and just got the booster on Monday. I was tired and a little lethargic for 24 hours, as I had been with the previous shots, but kept reminding myself that this was a small price to pay to avoid or at least mitigate the real thing. Since you want a robust immune response, feeling crummy after the shot is a good thing.
0	I already know four people who've been damaged by these injections. Two of them are dead.
1	I don't get why some people are still skeptical. The vaccine is our best shot at ending this mess.
0	I’m NOT an anti-vaxxer, and I have never been strongly against any injection before this year. Personally, I’m not getting this one because I don’t recommend it to anyone.
0	I'd rather focus on boosting my immune system naturally than rely on a vaccine.
0	I have not got the vax and everyone who is vaxed are falling around me like flies
1	I got both doses already and i’m feeling great. Hopefully this video helps other people ease their fear about this vaccine. We NEED it in order to beat this pandemic. I can’t wait for everything to go back to normal
0	So many people are going to be so ashamed of themselves when they finally figure out the truth
0	Vaccines are just Big Pharma's way to control us.
0	They talk about shedding which allows us to get some of the spike but I've been fine for the last 3 years and work around a lot of pt's who are jabbed
0	Why do people try to argue with lived experience  lecturing me that covid is a LOT worse when I’ve been absolutely decimated by the covid vaccines. They have destroyed my health more than covid did. I could work, go for walks. Now I require FT care. I hate the vaccines
0	I know many people affected after the jab. One young guy I worked with 29 yrs, never had a sickie in the 4 years he worked with me, developed liver failure after 3rd shot. Survived, but lots of health issues now. Too many other stories to recount. I was sacked after 20 yrs of service for refusing.
0	What happened to "the vaccine is safe and effective"? Did they mean it for those who didn't take it? ;)
1	vaccine is 100% safe
1	Breastfeeding mother's informed choice, transmitting antibodies for baby's immune boost.
1	"I'm 23 years old, got one dose of AstraZeneca, and today I have COVID. Thanks to God and the vaccine, I only had one day with fever and a headache. The other days, I've only been without taste or smell, no other symptoms."
0	Science requires honest assessment and controlled challenge , so if Pfizer admit they didn't test for transmission and that the jab had some harmful side effects why was it pushed on young healthy people at no risk from the virus , this young person caring for someone is totally justified to have serious concerns , the BBC could learn a lot from this woman's courage.
1	I’m so tired of hearing people say “they made the vaccine too fast, I want to wait til they know more”
1	Aaah finally got a schedule for booster shots. Been visiting and trying at different COVID vaccination sites but haven't been able to get slots. So glad to finally get a schedule 😊
0	I did not want the vaccine shots but was forced as a nurse. Got the first two Pfizer and got horribly ill. Refused the boosters and have been harassed over it. It’s been two years and I’m living with side effects from it. Extreme fatigue, vision issues, and heart palpitations.
1	Let's spread awareness about the importance of vaccines and the life-saving protection they offer.
0	Not heard anyone say they regretted NOT having the jab.
0	These Covid Vaccines are poison
1	Thanks to vaccines, I became a adult
1	Looking forward to an update on this vaccine
1	Turning your back on medical science during a pandemic is insanity.
0	was suddenly diagnosed with chronic kidney disease after i got my vaccine
0	Why are so many police officers dying of “medical emergencies”?  This is happening a LOT more than it used to.
1	Feeling a sense of relief and doing my part for community immunity.
0	The only thing you need to know- DON’T TAKE IT!
1	I'm 27 and fully vaccinated since February because I work in a hospital. A huge benefit for me has been the freedom from the anxiety of getting myself or others sick. It's such a relief. DFTBA! - Don't Forget To Build Antibodies!
1	Hospital staff/healthcare, first responders and essential workers should get the vaccine first! Then those who are at the highest risk of dying if infected should come next.
1	Let's keep it 100 – vaccines are the secret weapon for a healthier world. Get on board.
1	I got my vaccine because I believe in the power of science to save lives.
0	And this is why you should of never got the vaccine. I’m unvaccinated and never ever caught covid - never wore a mask, never did social distancing… basically never did anything the government asked lived my life as normal and this goes for 100s of people I know personally. Isn’t it strange now how all the vaccinated are getting really ill all of a sudden now?
0	I hate these dumb child abusing scumbags do they want their children to die? Please if you are a parent please for the love of god don’t listen to middle aged mums on Facebook letting their kids die from preventable diseases and vaccinate before it’s too late
1	For the antivaxers. Get the shot you wimps
0	And they are still pushing these kill shots and now they want them on the children's vaccine schedules .All for money..
0	They put trackers in vaccine and it will kill us.
1	I think that's great if it means more people can get it. As long as it remains a choice for people to get it or not to.
1	The thing about choice, they also come with consequences. And choosing to not be vaccinated and not following health precautions that are intended to protect the public comes with pretty life altering consequences.
0	... #GetVaccinated 🔄 ...with WHOs sponsor vaccines Pfizer...❗️❗️ .
0	Imagine being told, "either get the shot or lose your job." Then 2 weeks later you hear, "sorry about that, everything's okay now."
1	Why should New York bend for a basketball player? Basketball is a game, and people are losing their life’s for real. Kyrie Irving doesn’t have to get the shot, but he just won’t be able to play.
1	An unexpectedly emotional moment! Very privileged to have received vaccine today. In awe of the science that got us here.
0	That second vaccine I received this morning is kicking my ass like I stole something.... #Moderna
1	The vaccine has provided me with a newfound sense of security and resilience to face the future with confidence and hope.
1	Anti vax anti mask mentality is what Satan would want.
1	So after proven data and results on these poisons  anybody can have a change of heart?!!ï¸,it's not"flip-flop" but realizing that the truth and facts are coming out!!!
0	Shouldn't the vaccines be halted while you investigate these deaths?
0	There have been protocols that people have been successfully been able to work since this crisis, even in clinic and hospital settings so why should the vax all of a sudden be so mandatory?
1	was also pretty anti-vax. But when I got Lymphoma, I started realizing that not everything can be treated naturally. Then COVID came along and it shocked me that people wouldn’t get vaccinated for a current and serious threat! My son was born this last April and while I was scared to vaccinate him at his regular wellness appointments, I’m so glad I did! I no longer trust people who have no medical background that think they know more than the professionals
0	No vaccine for the common cold or flu ....no vacine for this one too.
1	I'm 27 and fully vaccinated since February because I work in a hospital. A huge benefit for me has been the freedom from the anxiety of getting myself or others sick.
0	As long as we learn from the last time, and respect a person's freedom and choices, we should be fine. No more dumb mask or social distancing or vaccine mandates!!
1	Anti vax people heard about this post and are on the way
0	My best friend's husband, a healthy hockey trainer, ended up having to get a pacemaker due to unexplained heart issues after the 2nd shot. They tried doing it through the vein, but too many clots. After that, he had multiple mini-strokes. Poor guy can't remember anything. We went on vacation together. He remembers going but can't tell you anything about the week. I try to talk to them about it, but they won't hear it. He even got a booster after all of that. So sad.
0	Let's see how many people died because they were not vaccinated because of their incompetent dumb parents and look who found this  3 million people die from vaccine-preventable diseases each year.
1	I got COVID in the Spring of 2020. I had heart palpitations and breathing problems for a long time. The vaccine helped me feel better.
0	I’m a Christian and I don’t vaccinate my family. In the Bible it says pharmakeia is sorcery and witch craft. Pharmaceuticals and pharmacy comes from that word. Bible also says the nations will be deceived by pharmakeia. Many blindly believe doctors and scientists but as a Christian I only fully trust God. After the doctors and scientists will tell you that you came from a monkey. Just reading the ingredients of vaccines is enough info to help me see they are the opposite of good for our bodies. Also vaccine companies have no liability if something happens to you from the vaccines. These companies have been sued countless times for other pharmaceuticals but not vaccines. That’s sketchy if you ask me. So many Christians I know don’t vaccinate. Also a lot of them have aborted fetal cells. God is not okay with that.
1	I just a regular guy - this is the most confusing video I’ve ever seen.  Just tell me what to take and when to take it.  Way to much information.  To much MR123 this and XYZ456 that.  I don’t care about what Variant is out there.  I don’t even know what a variant is.
0	I'd rather have COVID than taking that poison.
0	Lethary ever since!  Biggest mistake of my life!!!!!
0	Actually, I regret taking a COVID shot. Now I am trying to undo using Ayurvedic protocol,
0	Soo we’re just not ganna talk about why my arm swelled into a red/itchy golfball size bump on my second shot?!? Cool guess I’ll keep searching…..lol
0	My mother in law has deteriorated so bad constant headaches, rashes, and can’t remember Anything after her shots. Very active and mentally smart prior. Doctors deny it was jabs some nurses say opposite but afraid to say otherwise. I have zero trust in most doctors today.
1	When i got my second dose i was so sick i had the worst body chills and body aches. Basically the flu.. It lasted like 2 full days. My first dose i didn’t get any side affects.
0	To all of the doctors and nurses out there who have stuck their neck out on the line and spoke the truth about the injuries caused by The Vaccines the unvaccinated salute you
1	I have had both vaccines thank you to the scientists
0	Since 2003. I have a vax injured autistic son as a result.
1	Vaccine day. Have to say, school really came through for us.
0	Studying vaccine development prior to the COVID outbreak gave me all the information I needed to refuse the new vaccines. Best decision I ever made
1	If the vaccine kills people And 200 million Americans have gotten the vaccine…. (Do I need to finish?)
1	gudos to the doctor who conduct some awareness program about vaccination.this led most people to get vaccinated. i got vaccinated
0	Just got my cardiac catheter procedure because of a massive heart attack. No history of heart problems. No plaque, no blockages, no cholesterol issues, no apparent cause except the Covid vaccine I received.  I think I was unlucky.
1	It’s not unnecessary, not dangerous. There is no logical reason you shouldn’t get the jab. Thousands of doctors have agreed that it is safe.
0	vaxxers are unwittingly serving the interests of those who seek to control us?
1	How DARE he find out the truth and tell the people!
1	As a nurse who refused the vaccine, I lost a lot of friends at work.
1	Got my second dose today!
1	Thanks for the vaccine endorsement Hank. Hearing from people like you and Kyle Hill about the vaccine, helps to wipe away doubt. I was worried that things being fast tracked would mean safety steps would be skipped. Also that we don't know all of the long term effects if any from this vaccine. But I don't have a medical degree, so wondering about some of this stuff without knowing where I could get RELIABLE answers made me warry.
1	So the covid jab causes drowning now? What is next? Car accidents?
0	All of the normal vaccines are good like Tetnis but don’t get this one
1	“Additional” evidence may have been a better word here. There is a ton of evidence of its safety. For so rarely causing complications compared to pretty much any other type of medical intervention, vaccines do get an insane amount of scrutiny to try and satisfy public phobias.
1	My grandparents both received their vaccines recently, and it brings me comfort knowing they'll be safer from severe disease if they catch COVID-19
0	***The vaccine is the top 5 leading causes of deaths.
1	people forget that all medicin has some side-effects, but vaccines are in genereal very safe
1	So lucky to get the vaccine. Thinking of those still waiting.
0	People regret taking the poison, nobody regrets not taking the poison.
1	Help protect your community by getting a COVID-19 vaccine today.
1	Together we can be 0 covid. Vaccine works in its own pace. Have to choose what is right.
1	My mom felt the same way until she was in a coma for two months fighting for her life. First thing she said we she came out of it was “I’m getting the shot”.
0	I am unvaccinated and don't have any regrets
0	The Dr. just said that FDA approved the mrna vaccines quickly. In reality, the FDA has not approved any vaccines so far. They've just authorized them for emergency use.
1	Great news! Thank you so much for your hard work since January 2020!! It seems that Oxford vaccine will save alot of humans all over the globe !! I wish 2021 will be a better year !! Happy new year Doct
1	I got the covid vaccine! Got confirmed antibody test yesterday. So glad to be a part of science!
0	I’ve seen a child change after getting multiple vaccines in one day. One moment is talking, saying words next moment nonverbal autistic. I would love to be on one of these podcasts. The Lord knows I’m telling the truth.
1	Vaccination is a critical step toward returning to a more normal way of life.
1	I’m over 40 and have had 4 doses and my immune system is doing just fine. All of my family and relatives have been vaccinated and they are all alive and well.
0	Studying vaccine development prior to the COVID outbreak gave me all the information I needed to refuse the new vaccines.  Best decision I ever made
0	I don’t think the vaccine is dangerous. It’s just unnecessary. Covid is nothing more than a low grade cold.
0	I made the mistake of getting it (Moderna) so I could travel - in Sept of 2021. 38 year old male, never been to doctor for any disease or health related problem. Have now had chest pain for over a year, high bp, constant headaches and had to get put on beta blockers as well as getting stress test.
0	Good morning Dr. Campbell. Thank you for such a professional and easy to understand predation. I have had many friends and family members die unexpectedly including my own mother. I didn't vaccinated and very thankful to God and you. God bless
1	You should get the vaccine because (1) it reduces the chance that you will get the disease, (2) it reduces your risk of hospitalization and death should you get the disease, (3) it decreases the likelihood that those around you will get the disease, (4) 1-3 will ease the burden on medical professionals and hospitals, reducing the probability that other sick people are unable to find space in their local hospital, (5) keeping the virus from further catching hold will reduce the risk of future viral mutations, increasing safety to everyone, (6) there are people who aren't healthy or aren't old enough to become vaccinated who are also at risk of the disease, and you becoming vaccinated reduces the risk to that population, (7) just because you haven't caught it in two years doesn't mean you won't catch it; just because you're healthy doesn't mean you're completely protected from death or long-term symptoms.
1	Anti-vaxxed an are literally the worst. Their continued attacks and disinformation are akin to the West Borough Baptist Church members.
1	I’m actually glad for the ones who come back and say they wish they’d vaccinated. Because they’re the ones their other antivaxx friends are more likely to listen to.
0	For no one ! Not teachers not health carers , no one ! you can’t force people taking part on this experiment!
1	I got my second dose a few days ago. I ran a fever that just broke. Even though I felt terrible and thought I made a mistake, bottomline is that I don't regret it. I am one step closer to be able to do everything that makes me happy. A little bit of pain is better than a lifetime of unknown consequences
0	Need 2 doses.. one for the micro chip and one to wipe your memory.
1	1 of 5 Americans still think covid vaccines can change your DNA!  That explains why we're going thru covid hell again!
1	Vaccines are inherently good
0	There's a man who should receive a Presidential Medal of Honour. Stay safe, get your vaccine.
0	I've had 2 covid vaccines, and I've been suffering from more infections and ill health than my previous record of 15 years with only 2 - 3 days off work due to sickness.   I've spoken to many people, and the consensus is that they do feel their health has deteriorated significantly AFTER the covid vaccines.   I wish I didn't follow the bandwagon and media regarding the scaremongering of covid and should have stayed firm and avoided the vaccines altogether...
0	No one who already had COVID needs a shot. Which is virtually everyone.
0	No sir. No jab for me. NO THANKS
1	I understand the value of getting vaccinated and have been fully vaccinated. I really want to avoid getting a full viral load of coronavirus as that can kill or make you very ill with possible long term health implications.
0	If you’re happy to take a rushed experimental vaccine for a bad flu then you’re crazy. If you think having the vaccine means the end to all the other restrictions then you’re even crazier.
1	It's like being anti-surgery because there's a death rate for every operation.
0	"Cheers to all those heroes who didn't get vaccinated, including myself... and may the force be with us today and always."
1	Wearing a mask prevents long covid? So it’s like the vaccine? You still get covid but not as bad?
1	Just a reminder to everyone: If you don't get the vaccine for any reason other than you medically can not, you do not get to complain about quarantine since you don't want to do anything to help. You are going to sit in your home and stfu about it since you are not being helpful
0	“It’s not just a decision that affects you.” Hmmm, ok, let me just say no, that’s bollocks.
0	Since iv had the first 2 boosters IV never been the same I was healthy with no problems now I have so many problems and I'm getting worse also my mom and my wife are not the same they are getting all sorts of problems now and my wife was ok now she has be
1	The vaccine is the only thing that will give us a chance to go back to normal. It's a good thing.
1	Just sick of people who are rejecting the vaccine and believing the nonsense being spread about the #OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine. Go out and get it people!
1	To the healthcare workers who vaccinated me: you're not just giving shots; you're giving families their future back.
0	I think the media and governments are exaggerating the benefits of the vaccine.
1	Vaccination is free from Govt which make us free from Covid
0	I've never made a better decision in my life by protecting most of my family from the not vaccine.
1	I’m 20 and just got my second dose today! I’m glad that I did something to protect the more vulnerable members of my family. The relief I feel is indescribable
0	Hi Lucy. My father had his second Moderna shot and then had a stroke.
1	My grandma died because she could not get an ICU bed because of all the unvaccinated COVID patients. To say I am heartbroken, bitter, and angry is an understatement.
1	Funny thing is that if there was an experimental vaccine that would make you lose fat without dieting and exercising, anti-vaxxers would line up to take it without hesitation.
0	COVID-19 vaccines can make young children very sick.
1	If I had a time machine, I'll inspire people to make the right choices of getting vaccinated by giving them proper information about vaccines.
0	Úrsula didn't kill enough people with the covid vaccine, so she's trying to do that with the cancer vaccine.
0	Yeah…Scare everyone so they’ll run outand take the jabbb/poison!
0	There is no possible way a rational adult could still be supporting mRNA vaccines.
1	It is a dangerous theory though. Your chances of dying while acquiring "natural immunity" are orders of magnitude higher than while acquiring vaccine immunity. A lot of those "natural immunity" people in the article are saying that COVID is no big deal and that a healthy immune system can handle it. That actually is probably the case for most healthy 20 year olds (of course there are exceptions) but for anybody 40+ the math does not check out regardless of physical fitness. It's a deadly disease. Once you have the immunity, sure the source matters a lot less. But the acquisition methods couldn't be more different in terms of danger
1	If we've gotten to the point where we're questioning vaccines we've become too privileged
0	I don't trust the COVID vaccine, I'd rather take my chances with the virus.
1	Antivax is just late term abortions
1	I'm certainly glad to see a "dose" (PUN INTENDED) of common sense! I wish there were a vaccination against stupidity.
0	I value the protection the vaccine provides, especially in environments where social distancing is challenging.
0	Pfizer have paid billions because of lies they told In thir marketing in the past. Why would this be any different
1	Experts say that Covid will likely lose its "pandemic" status sometime in 2022, due largely to rising global vaccination rates and developments of antiviral Covid pills that could become more widespread next year How convenient Wonder if this will be before or after midterms...
0	The side effects are being healthy
0	Luckily I knew this was the case earlier than most ……lastly that is way more dangerous than the actual infection but don’t ask them about that ……..staying strong and never take that crap
